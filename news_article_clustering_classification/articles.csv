Nirbhaya Fund: Where did millions set aside after Delhi gang rape go?,"Nirbhaya Fund: Where did millions set aside after Delhi gang rape go? Published 12 hours ago

image copyright Getty Images image caption How much has changed for rape survivors since 2012?

In 2013 - the year after the Delhi gang rape - India launched the ambitious Nirbhaya Fund, vowing to reduce violence against women. But a major new report by the charity Oxfam India finds that the fund has not done its job. The BBC's Aparna Alluri and Shadab Nazmi report.

In 2017, Kavita (whose name and those of other survivors in this article have been changed) turned up at a police station in rural Orissa state to allege her father-in-law had raped her. But the police, she says, summoned her in-laws, lectured them and sent her home to her parents. No case was registered. The police said it was a ""family affair"".

Pinky, 42, arrived late one night at a police station in Uttar Pradesh state in 2019. She says she was visibly injured after a ""bad beating"" by her husband. Even so, police took hours to register her complaint. When she then fled to her home city of Lucknow, fearing for her life, she went to the police there too. But she says the officer ""looked her up and down"" and told her she was at fault before eventually registering her complaint.

Late last year, Priya, 18, went to a police station in Orissa, alleging that the man she had eloped with had raped her and then disappeared. She says the officer told her: ""You didn't ask us before falling in love with him and now you have come to us for help."" She claims she was then forced to change her complaint to say she was married to him and he had abandoned her - a different crime with a shorter prison term.

Anyone who works with survivors of domestic or sexual violence - from social workers to lawyers to policy wonks - will tell you these examples are depressingly common in India. And that the hundreds of millions of dollars in government money that were supposed to make them less so haven't achieved their aim.

image copyright Getty Images image caption Protesters flooded the streets of Delhi in the wake of the 2012 gang rape

The Nirbhaya Fund is so named because of how the media referred to the young woman murdered in the 2012 Delhi gang rape. Indian law prohibits the identification of rape victims, so the media called her ""nirbhaya"", or fearless.

Her case, which sparked massive protests and headlines around the world, is seen as a watershed moment that led to new anti-rape laws and stricter guidelines for the medical examination and counselling of survivors of sexual violence in India. The fund was meant to kickstart changes that are long overdue.

But a new report by Oxfam India has found that red tape, underspend, obscure allocations and a lack of political will have undermined the Nirbhaya Fund, which was already up against a stubborn foe: patriarchy.

Here's why that has happened.

Women - and services - take second place

Most of the Nirbhaya Fund has gone to India's home ministry, which oversees police. But Amita Pitre of Oxfam India says the money has largely paid for programmes - improving emergency response services, upgrading forensic labs or expanding units fighting cyber crimes - that don't exclusively benefit women.

From railways to roads, money has been directed towards better lighting, more CCTV cameras, safer public transport and even a research grant to test panic buttons in vehicles.

""People want technology-based answers - but that won't help in 80% of cases where the accused are people known to women,"" Ms Pitre says.

These programmes are also heavily focused on physical resources, something that Nirbhaya's mother, Asha Devi, has criticised.

""The Nirbhaya Fund should have been used for women's security and empowerment but it is being used for works like road construction,"" she said in 2017.

Training officers in trauma-informed policing and investigation would be of more benefit to women like Kavita or Pinky, campaigners say.

Pinky, for instance, says she waited in the Lucknow police station for an hour-and-half while the inspector played badminton. When he finally agreed to talk to her, he told her: ""This is between you and your husband. We only get involved if it's a stranger.""

image copyright Getty Images image caption Asha Devi, whose daughter was killed in the 2012 Delhi gang rape, has criticised the use of the fund

It took Kavita more than three years to finally register a case against her father-in-law. The inspector who discouraged her from filing rape charges told her caseworker that since the accused was the father-in-law, it qualified as a domestic violence charge, not rape.

""I was so shocked I asked him how he had become an inspector without knowing the law,"" the caseworker recalls.

But changing attitudes is costlier and harder than buying CCTV cameras - and that partly explains why so much of the money has not even been used.

Underspend is a major problem

While the home ministry has spent most of the money given to it from the fund, other government departments and most state governments have largely sat on the cash.

The federal women and child development ministry, for instance, used only 20% of the money it had received up to 2019, accounting for about a quarter of the total Nirbhaya Fund spending since 2013. Its money went to set up crisis centres for rape or domestic violence survivors, shelters for women, female police volunteers and a women's helpline.

""It is not enough to launch a scheme,"" Ms Pitre says. ""It is important to remove bottlenecks to expenditures and effective implementation.""

This is where the fund has faltered most, campaigners say. While it's easy to set up centres and teams, sustaining them is much harder. Crisis centres exist in many places and do valuable work, but they often lack staff and money to pay for things from salaries to transport to unexpected charges - such as when a woman turns up in the middle of the night and might need a change of clothes if hers are torn or bloodied.

In Uttar Pradesh, public hospitals don't have enough rape kits or swabs or zip lock bags to collect and transport evidence, says Shubhangi Singh, a lawyer who counsels rape and domestic violence survivors.

By Oxfam's calculations, the Nirbhaya Fund is underfunded - it needs $1.3bn to allow even 60% of women dealing with any form of violence to be able to access services.

So why isn't the money being used up? ""One reason is that they create hurdles, through say, daunting paperwork,"" says Reetika Kehra, an economist. ""And there is no guarantee that even if the money is left over, it will roll over to the next year.""

This uncertainty is also what could be stopping so many states from applying for or using the funds. They may be reluctant to commit to programmes whose future is uncertain, especially since the money is coming from the federal budget.

It's hard to say if the fund has been growing

It was endowed in 2013 with $113m (£82m) but has had something of a rollercoaster ride in the years since.

The money is split across schemes and categories whose names change each year so the easiest way to track the fund is to trace the amount that was actually released, and not what was allocated.

""Constantly rejigging these classifications is one way of projecting an increase. It becomes harder to compare like with like,"" Ms Khera says.

The Nirbhaya Fund is part of what the government calls a ""gender budget"" - money disbursed to programmes that benefit women. And the gender budget has been shrinking.

The gender budget follows the same pattern

More than a third of this year's $21.3bn gender budget went to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship rural housing scheme - it helps the poor build homes, but a woman must be listed as owner or co-owner. The scheme has been a major beneficiary in the last two budgets as well.

While gender rights activists welcome the initiative, they are not so sure it's the best way to spend money from an already underfunded part of the pie.

""Most economics is a political calculation. In some states women vote more than men,"" says economist Vivek Kaul.

Also among the list of beneficiaries is a scheme to help rural women buy cooking gas (hence, the petroleum ministry received money from the Nirbhaya Fund) and a host of agriculture measures.

What about rights?

Since the fatal Delhi gang rape there has been no sign of crimes against women and girls abating in India, and justice remains out of reach for most.

A series of rape cases since 2012 have made global headlines for botched investigations, which in turn stymie prosecutions. And if the woman is poor - or from a tribe or at the bottom of India's unforgiving caste hierarchy - the odds against her are stacked even higher.

""If there is something worse than corruption, it is callousness,"" says Vikram Singh, a former director general of police in Uttar Pradesh. ""We have not been able to recruit women prosecutors, police officers, judges and get our fast track courts in place. It's tardy utilisation of the Nirbhaya Fund.""

He says there is a ""cult of masculinity"" that goes all the way down to police constables and cannot be dismantled without serious reforms and accountability - such as an independent authority to investigate complaints against police officers.

The apathy and casual misogyny extends beyond the police to doctors and even judges.

There has, however, been no money set aside to train doctors, although doctors play a key role in rape investigations and it's easier for women suffering domestic abuse to reach out to a doctor than a police officer. Education also appears low on the list of priorities but campaigners say it's crucial to change the way young boys think before they become men.

But gender rights advocates say funding is only one part of the challenge. The other is the continued emphasis on protecting women's honour rather than empowering them to exercise their rights.

They point to a growing body of research that shows certainty of conviction rather than severity of punishment is the biggest deterrence against crime. And that will only happen if a woman can walk into a police station and register a complaint.

""You need someone to drive that process,"" Ms Khera says. ""There are ways to kill a programme while appearing to put all your weight behind it."""

Australian Open: Fans back as Grand Slam gets under way in Melbourne,"Fans watch Austrian third seed Dominic Thiem - last year's men's singles runner-up - take on Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin on Rod Laver Arena

Throngs of excited fans walking along the Yarra River in the summer sun turns into a hubbub of noise and colour inside Melbourne Park on the opening day of the Australian Open. In normal times.

This year, however, players and fans alike are simply grateful there is even an Australian Open going on at all.

Taking place in a country that has enforced some of the world's toughest restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, months of hard work and negotiations came to fruition when the first Grand Slam of the year started on Monday.

Tournament organisers revealed there were 17,922 visitors on an opening day when star attractions including Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams were in action. In comparison, 64,387 passed through the gates last year.

Nevertheless, it represents a triumph for Australian Open organisers. No tennis tournaments - nor many other events in the sporting world - have been allowed to host this number of people since the pandemic began.

Starting three weeks later than usual to enable players to quarantine, up to 30,000 fans are allowed on to the site each day.

The stands are not tightly packed like usual, though. People are sitting in socially distanced groups, mostly without masks, leaving large numbers of empty blue seats.

Fans are not craning necks and finding unusual vantage points to catch a glimpse of the action, they are instead following strict protocols and using some of the 800 hand sanitiser dispensers.

The outdoor concourses are not bubbling with the usual party atmosphere, either. Instead, it's click and collect for food and drink and QR codes for contact tracing.

Melbourne Park has been split into three zones to enforce social distancing, with a maximum of 10,000 spectators in each zone.

""There is so much space, no queues for the toilets or the bars. You can do all that and there are major seeds playing on the outer courts,"" said commentator Alison Mitchell, one of those at the venue.

""That has been the crazy thing about day one.""

The overcast weather in Melbourne also may have contributed to few fans wandering around the site

Mitchell told Tennis Breakfast on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra that crowds seemed to have increased for the evening session.

""There is a bit more bustle,"" she said. ""But one of my friends - who had a day ticket for Margaret Court Arena - told me that he received a text saying if you have a day session ticket, you can enter the MCA night session free of charge.

""That tells you on day one they haven't sold out MCA for the night session, which also says all you need to know about Melburnians being nervous about coming in.""

There has been a mixed reaction in Melbourne to the decision to go ahead with the Australian Open, with many locals worried about the Covid risks of so many players travelling to the area.

The tournament's delayed start means it is not taking place in the school summer holidays as usual. Mitchell says the fear of being contact traced - and subsequently having to do a 14-day quarantine - is also keeping people away.

""Melburnians are scarred. They've had it tough,"" she said.

Some of those fans who were there showed their Australian colours

While there might not be the buzz of previous years at the 'Happy Slam', the players are relieved to have any semblance of a crowd to play in front of after a US Open behind closed doors and a French Open limited to crowds of 1,000.

""I felt like there was more interaction than in New York because in New York it was just a generic crowd noise every point. This was more fun,"" 2019 champion Naomi Osaka said.

Asked about the vibe, Canada's Milos Raonic said: ""If you're referring to the Australian Open last year, then it's quite different. If you're referring to the US Open, it's quite different as well.

""It was nice to see people rolling in and be able to come see tennis. I think people will get the confidence [to attend] once they sort of see the first few days go by.""

One fan already undaunted was Boris Trbojevic, who travelled 1,700km from Brisbane to watch the tennis for a few days.

""It's a risk, but that's the way it is,"" the 30-year-old said. ""Australia as a country has been doing great. Just one new case overnight, but it's one case out of 25 million people."""

2022 Winter Olympic Games: Beijing air pollution fears raised in new report,"The Beijing Winter Games will start in February 2022

Athletes competing at next year's Winter Olympics could be doing so in potentially hazardous, polluted air, a new academic study says.

The report, to be published in the journal Sport and Society and shared with the BBC, looked at air quality data over the past five years for the month of February - when the games will be held - and found poor to hazardous conditions on as many as 15 days, with an average of 9.5 days.

""I am very concerned about the air quality in Beijing,"" said the report's co-author Dr Madeleine Orr, assistant professor at the State University of New York.

""The challenge for athletes with air quality is that they are at higher risk because they are outdoors and they're exerting themselves. Tiny particles in the air that you can't see lodge themselves in your airways and in your lungs and that can be damaging in the long term. It also can impede performance in the immediate. We're talking carbon, methane, sulphur and so on,"" she explained.

Similar concerns about air quality were reported before the 2008 summer Games when Chinese authorities introduced measures to reduce pollution - something Orr expects to see again. ""The question is will it be enough,"" she said.

The athlete's view

US biathlete Maddie Phaneuf is also an ambassador for Protect Our Winters, which aims to raise awareness of the impact of climate change on winter sports

The biggest impact of any pollution would be felt by competitors in the snow sport endurance events. American biathlete Maddie Phaneuf said: ""It's extremely worrying, not only for my own personal health and the effects of breathing that air but also everyone that lives in Beijing and people who will be coming to watch the Olympics, or other athletes competing.

""We're an endurance sport and breathing pretty heavily during our competitions. It's enough where even the slightest change in air pollution is going to affect our lungs and how we feel when we're racing and training so it is challenging and it would be a big concern for me if they didn't clean it up.""

What does the International Olympic Committee say?

Chinese authorities are investing in a nine-year programme to improve air quality in Beijing

The IOC, which raised the issue of air pollution when assessing Beijing's bid to host the 2022 Winter Games, says it has been working with local organisers to address it.

""Beijing 2022 Organising Committee has made commitments to curb air pollution to meet World Health Organization standards during Games-time in 2022. Beijing 2022 has already made progress with its efforts to improve air quality. A large number of initiatives have been put in place,"" it told BBC Sport.

Initiatives include having all venues powered with renewable energy, while the government has invested in a Beijing Clean Air Action Plan.

The IOC also pointed to lower air pollution rates achieved during the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing.

It also said endurance events, such as biathlon and cross country skiing - which are most heavily affected by air pollution - will be taking place in the city of Zhangjiakou, which Chinas says has the best air quality in the region.

The local organising committee has not responded to BBC requests for comment.

Could water use be a problem?

The Beijing Games will be almost entirely dependent on fake snow

The report also looked at historical data to confirm Beijing's weather is not conducive to winter sports events, with low snow fall meaning the Games will be almost entirely dependent on fake snow - which, as Dr Orr points out, has its own environmental impact with ""a severe need for water"" to fuel snow guns.

""This is great in terms of providing conditions in order to have the event but is bad from an environmental standpoint.""

The IOC says ""the snow production capabilities for the Olympic Games Beijing 2022 have been developed according to the highest technical and environmental standards"".

The lack of available, real snow, does however raise longer-term concerns about the threat posed to snow sports by climate change, according to Phaneuf, who is an ambassador for an organisation called Protect Our Winters, which wants to raise awareness about this issue.

""That is the scary thing about the viability of the Winter Olympics continuing or our sports continuing as it's going to start getting worse and worse with whether we can even race or what countries can even host the Olympics,"" she said."

News the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has only a limited effect against the South African variant of coronavirus has caused understandable concern.

It is the vaccine many people in the UK are being given.

And the news comes just days after scientists warned the variant may be circulating in this country.

But what actually is the significance of this?

Mutation seems to make all vaccines less effective

Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. In fact, it can be expected to continue.

As more people build up immunity - either through vaccination or exposure to the virus - there is going to be selection pressure on the virus, favouring changes that allow it to escape human defences.

The changes seen in South Africa are an example of this. And it means all the vaccines produced so far are likely to work less well against this variant.

Some of the trials for the Novavax and Janssen vaccines, which reported last month, were in South Africa when the variant was circulating widely.

They showed the vaccines worked less well against it than other versions of the virus. Although, they were still about 60% effective at stopping people developing symptoms.

image copyright Getty Images

What has caused particular concern with these Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine results, however, is the vaccine appeared to have just a ""minimal"" impact, maybe only around 22%.

The finding is based on a small study, involving fewer than 2,000 people, with an average age of just over 30.

So there can be only limited confidence in it. But it clearly raises very real questions.

However, there is hope the vaccine would still be very effective at preventing serious illness and hospital admissions.

What does this mean for people called for jabs now?

The most important thing to remember is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine remains highly effective against the type of virus dominant in the UK.

And the same is true for the other vaccine being used in the UK, produced by Pfizer-BioNTech.

There have been fewer than 150 cases of the South African variant detected in the UK.

Admittedly, there are bound to be more out there - only 5-10% of positive cases are checked for mutations as requires extensive lab work and so cannot be done for every case.

But there are no signs it is widespread and extra testing has been ordered in the places where there are signs the variant may be spreading to try to contain it.

Prof Jonathan Van Tam, England's chief medical officer, believes this will be effective in the short-term, mainly because the South African variant does not have an advantage over the more transmissible UK variant at the moment.

What does this mean for lockdown?

The developments once again illustrate the pandemic is not going to end with a big bang. It is going to be incremental.

The key mutation in the South African variant that helps it evade immunity - E484 - has already been replicated in the virus circulating in the UK.

But there is nothing to suggest this is anything more than a few isolated cases - it has been detected in Liverpool and Bristol.

Nonetheless it is a strong signal this is the route the virus will go down as immunity builds in the population.

The good news is that it is relatively easy to tweak the vaccines to make them more effectiv.

Last week, the Oxford-AstraZeneca team said if necessary it could be ready for the rollout of a new vaccine in a matter of months.

The idea would be to offer repeat, booster vaccinations much as we do each year for the flu.

image copyright University of Oxford

Understandably, questions are now being asked about what this means for lockdown and restrictions.

Some say tough restrictions need to continue because of the threat of mutations.

But UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has always been clear we ultimately have to learn to live with the virus.

It will remain a ""residual threat"" for quite some time, he says, arguing the goal is to ""de-risk"" it to the point where the level of serious illness and death becomes tolerable and the pressure on the NHS is eased.

So, given the vaccines remain highly effective against the dominant form of virus circulating in the UK, the opportunity for a major relaxation of the rules should still present itself."

Israel's Netanyahu enters plea in court in corruption trial,"Israel's Netanyahu enters plea in court in corruption trial Published 1 day ago

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied corruption charges in court for the first time as his trial resumes in Jerusalem.

Mr Netanyahu entered his plea at the hearing which had been previously postponed because of the pandemic.

He is the first serving Israeli prime minister to go on trial, which takes place just a month before elections.

Mr Netanyahu, 71, is accused of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases.

Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the district courthouse ahead of the prime minister's brief appearance on Monday morning, making noise, waving banners and calling for him to resign.

Mr Netanyahu had urged supporters not to come to court because of the threat of coronavirus.

The prime minister arrived for the hearing wearing a black protective mask. Inside the courtroom he rose to reject the charges, before departing within 45 minutes while his lawyers continued deliberations.

What is Benjamin Netanyahu accused of?

Mr Netanyahu has been indicted in three cases, known as 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000:

Case 1,000 - Fraud and breach of trust: he is accused of receiving gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours

Case 2,000 - Fraud and breach of trust: Mr Netanyahu is accused of offering to help improve the circulation of Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot in exchange for positive coverage

Case 4,000 - Bribery, fraud and breach of trust: as PM and minister of communications at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Netanyahu is accused of promoting regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder in the Bezeq telecom giant, Shaul Elovitch, in exchange for positive coverage by Mr Elovitch's Walla news site

media caption November 2019 - Benjamin Netanyahu rails against corruption charges

Mr Netanyahu has consistently denied all the charges against him, branding them a ""witch-hunt"" by political opponents, and has vowed to clear his name.

How can the PM serve and stand trial at the same time?

According to Israeli law, a leader charged with a crime is not required to resign. But there is no precedent.

A former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stepped down as party leader when he was under investigation for corruption in 2008 but technically remained prime minister until elections the following year - polls which brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power.

What does the trial mean for the country?

In short, a serving prime minister occupying the most powerful office in the land simultaneously trying to clear his name and avoid jail-time.

It comes just six weeks before Israelis go to the polls in what is expected to be a close-fought election.

While Mr Netanyahu's own Likud party has stood behind him, political opponents have tried to maximise the prime minister's legal difficulties, claiming he is unfit to hold office.

Mr Netanyahu has though previously successfully fought three elections since criminal investigations into him began in 2016.

Even if he is convicted and is still in power, Mr Netanyahu will not be required to resign unless and until any appeals are exhausted - which could, in theory, be many months or years into the future."

Super Bowl 2021: Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes go head to head,"The ultimate guide to watching the Super Bowl in lockdown

Super Bowl 55 on the BBC Venue: Raymond James Stadium, Tampa Bay Date: Sunday, 7 February Start: 23:30 GMT Live coverage: Watch on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer and online; Listen to commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live; Live text and in-play clips on the BBC Sport website and app.

It's a fitting finale to the most unique of NFL seasons and the blockbuster game that everyone wanted to see, as the widely-recognised greatest of all time Tom Brady takes on arguably the greatest talent of his generation in Patrick Mahomes in Super Bowl 55.

In these Covid times Sunday's showpiece match between Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs will be very different off the field, but promises to be a classic on it.

But will Brady or Mahomes be celebrating at the end? Who else could influence the game? And how will the coaches try to outwit each other?

The GOAT versus the Baby GOAT?

Brady, 43, has rolled back the years in his first season at the Bucs to get them to their second Super Bowl and what will be an incredible 10th appearance personally.

A winner six times with the New England Patriots, Brady is considering playing until he's at least 45, and that seems highly likely given he has looked at his best this season, with his 4,633 passing yards the fifth most of his career and crucially the 34 passes of 20 yards or more the most he has ever thrown - showing that his arm is as strong as ever.

While Brady is eyeing a seventh Super Bowl ring, Mahomes is looking for his second and to make the Chiefs the first team to defend their Super Bowl title since Brady himself with the Patriots 17 years ago.

There's the largest age gap between quarterbacks (18 years and 45 days) in Super Bowl history and in terms of styles they're polar opposites.

Mahomes is a dazzling mover, a creative passer capable of no-look throws and sidearm strikes, while Brady is the cerebral pocket passer who studies defences at the line and decides where to attack before the ball even gets into his hands.

What binds these two modern greats, even at opposite ends of their careers, is their sheer desire to win that extends off the field and into every training session of every day throughout the season.

Brady has always put winning ahead of ego, of passing numbers, and even of zeros on his contract at times, and Mahomes is aiming to emulate Brady in that as much as his unfathomable success, to join the true elite of American sport.

""If you look at guys like Tom, Michael (Jordan), Kobe (Bryant), LeBron (James), A-Rod (Alex Rodriguez), all these special guys, at the end of the day you see their work ethic and drive to win is just different than everybody else's,"" said Mahomes.

""That's what makes them special, and hopefully I can try to do whatever I can to have that same work ethic and drive in my career.""

A Super Bowl like no other

Coronavirus restrictions have taken some of the fizz out of what may have been the most hyped-up Super Bowl of all time - Mahomes versus Brady with the Buccaneers being the first team to play in a home Super Bowl, but it's on the low-key side for obvious reasons.

The regular media free-for-all has been done politely via video conferences, with mute buttons being a welcome addition for some, while the Chiefs have remained in Kansas City throughout the week and flew in at the weekend. Whether that calms nerves and helps them treat it as a normal game remains to be seen.

The NFL have limited attendance to 22,000 fans inside Raymond James Stadium, including 7,500 vaccinated healthcare workers who have been invited as a show of gratitude for their work during the pandemic. Traditional Super Bowl parties and fan gatherings around the city have also been scratched or limited as a precaution.

An eagerly-anticipated half-time show will feature The Weeknd, who insisted there would be no surprise guests and said the stage for his performance has been built ""within the stadium"" for safety reasons.

History will also be made on the sidelines as Sarah Thomas becomes the first woman to officiate in the Super Bowl.

Strengths and weaknesses

Most pundits are expecting a thrilling shootout, with Mahomes to shine with his unorthodox throws and off-script running ability.

Around him he has speedy receivers everywhere, and probably the fastest in Tyreek Hill, who scored three touchdowns when the teams met earlier in the season.

Tight end Travis Kelce, who had his own primetime TV dating show, is a primetime player setting records as he goes, while on defence Tyrann Mathieu (known as the honey badger) is their play-maker who often seems everywhere.

The big problem for the Chiefs comes on their offensive line - the big men tasked with protecting Mahomes - as injuries mean they've had to re-shuffle. With Tampa Bay's Shaquil Barrett and Jason Pierre-Paul haranguing Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers all night in the Championship game two weeks ago, Mahomes will see a lot of those two close-up on Sunday.

For the Buccaneers, Brady has probably the best set of attacking options he's had in his entire career, with Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Cameron Brate top pass-catchers, and the outstanding tight end Rob Gronkowski.

The Chiefs won 27-24 during the season, with Mahomes carving up their defence so look for Tampa Bay to try and run the ball as often as possible with Leonard Fournette and Ronald Jones. Brady's biggest strength is thinking on his feet, taking what opposition teams give him and judging just what it will take to win.

Jack Nicklaus used to figure out what score he would need to win a major and play to that, Brady has proven over the years to have a similar sense of how to get the job done.

The men in charge

Chiefs boss Andry Reid and Bucs head coach Bruce Arians make up the oldest head coaching combination in Super Bowl history, with 68-year-old Arians being the oldest coach to make his big-game debut and possibly the oldest winner.

Both Arians and 62-year-old Reid are risk takers, they like to play a fast, exciting game, with Arians' 'no risk it, no biscuit' mantra reflected in his play calling. He came out of retirement to lead the Bucs and perhaps his best move has been to largely allow Brady to play his own game - even calling his own plays at times.

'Big Red' Reid has built a dynamic, creative and innovative attack under Mahomes, and he's also not afraid to go for the jugular as he showed during the play-offs.

It's his 22nd season as a head coach and third Super Bowl appearance as he looks for a second win. He's also one of the most successful and likeable around the league - despite the new breed coming in he's still leading the way in terms of offensive creativity.

Both coaches are also leading the calls for greater diversity in the NFL coaching ranks, with Arians compiling the most diverse staff in the league. Tampa Bay are the only team to have black coaches in all four top coordinator positions and also the only team to have two women as full-time coaches."
Covid: South Africa halts AstraZeneca vaccine rollout over new variant,"Covid: South Africa halts AstraZeneca vaccine rollout over new variant Published 15 hours ago

image copyright Reuters image caption South Africa has recorded more than 1.4 million Covid cases

South Africa has put its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold after a study showed ""disappointing"" results against its new Covid variant.

Scientists say the variant accounts for 90% of new Covid cases in South Africa.

The trial, involving some 2,000 people, found that the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases.

But experts are hopeful that the vaccine will still be effective at preventing severe cases.

South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent.

The country has received one million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and was preparing to start vaccinating people.

On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against jumping to conclusions about the efficacy of Covid vaccines.

Dr Katherine O'Brien, the WHO's director of immunisation, said it was very plausible that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would still have a meaningful impact on the South African variant, especially when it came to preventing hospitalisations and death.

""Comparing from one piece of evidence to the next really can't be done without a sort of level playing field,"" she said, referring to the evaluation of different trials in different populations and age groups.

Dr O'Brien stressed that the WHO's expert panel held ""a very positive view"" of proceeding with the use of the vaccine, including in areas where variants were circulating, but that more data and information would be needed as the pandemic continued.

South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said his government would wait for further advice on how best to proceed with the AstraZeneca vaccine in light of the findings.

In the meantime, he said, the government would offer vaccines produced by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in the coming weeks.

What does it mean for serious cases?

The trial was carried out by researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and the UK's Oxford University, but has not yet been peer reviewed.

The trial's chief investigator, Prof Shabir Madhi, said it showed that ""unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness"".

media caption Prof Barry Schoub on South Africa's decision to stop the AstraZeneca vaccine roll-out.

Prof Madhi said the study had not been able to investigate the vaccine's efficacy in preventing more serious infections, as participants had an average age of 31 and so did not represent the demographic most at risk of severe symptoms from the virus.

The vaccine's similarity to one produced by Johnson & Johnson, which was found in a recent study to be highly effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa, suggested it would still prevent serious illness, according to Prof Madhi.

""There's still some hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine might well perform as well as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a different age group demographic that I address of severe disease,"" he told the BBC.

Other experts were also hopeful that the vaccine remained effective at combating more serious cases.

""What we're seeing from other vaccine developers is that they have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses and what that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases, but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford's lead vaccine developer, told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.

She said developers were likely to have a modified version of the injection against the South Africa variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, later this year.

Ministers in the UK have sought to reassure the public over the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the injection appeared to work well against dominant variants in the UK, while Health Minister Edward Argar said there was ""no evidence"" the vaccine was not effective at preventing severe illness.

Early results also suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants.

We should be careful about rushing to judgement

Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising.

The mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target. It means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way.

Trials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator.

Therefore the news about Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue.

The fact it now only has ""minimal"" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant.

But we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings.

What is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation.

What this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus.

Progress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this.

What do we know about the variant?

The South Africa variant carries a mutation that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread.

However, there is no evidence that it causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions.

At least 20 other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have found cases of the variant.

Health officials say all is not lost

Many South Africans have reacted with shock and disappointment at news that the 1.5 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines will not be as effective as experts had hoped against the new variant first discovered here in November.

While there are now more questions than ready answers, the message from health officials is that all is not lost. They believe the vaccine may still be effective in preventing severe illness and go some way in reducing the number of people who need to be admitted into hospital for treatment.

This is important in a country where some 80% of the population cannot afford private health care and rely on state hospitals - which are currently overstretched - for health care.

So what's the plan now? South Africa's health minister has said they will take a steer from local scientists on how to repurpose the vaccine to get the most out of it.

It has been suggested that the vaccine may be useful if given to the older population and to people with co-morbidities.

In terms of managing people's concerns, the government and scientists may need to go the extra mile in reassuring citizens that there is still a plan in place and lives can and will be saved.

Leon Spinks: Ex-heavyweight champion who shocked Muhammad Ali dies aged 67,"Last updated on .From the section Boxing

Leon Spinks stunned Muhammad Ali in 1978 before losing a rematch

Former world heavyweight champion Leon Spinks has died aged 67.

The American achieved a famous upset win over Muhammad Ali in 1978, in just his eighth professional fight.

He had suffered with health issues in his later years and was diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer in 2019.

""His final fight was fought with the same skill, grace and grit that had carried him through so many lifetime challenges,"" said a statement from his management company.

The former US marine died on Friday evening in Henderson, Nevada, with his wife Brenda Glur Spinks by his side.

""Leon fought his battle with numerous illnesses resiliently, never losing his trademark smile. Showing true Spinks determination, he never threw in the towel,"" the statement added.

Born in St Louis, Spinks won gold at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, then rose to greater prominence a little more than 18 months later, given the nod via a split decision to stun Ali and claim the WBC, WBA and lineal heavyweight titles.

In one of the biggest upsets in the history of the sport, Spinks defied his 10-1 underdog odds with bookmakers to prevail after 15 rounds, winning 145-140 and 144-141 on two scorecards while a third went 143-142 in favour of Ali.

His reign as world champion lasted exactly seven months as a sharper and fitter Ali gained revenge in a rematch in September 1978, becoming the first three-time lineal heavyweight champion after a comfortable points win.

Spinks did get another opportunity for heavyweight glory in June 1981, but was stopped inside three rounds by Larry Holmes.

Spinks then dropped down to cruiserweight but was defeated by WBA champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi in 1986. He boxed on for another nine years and finished with a record of 26 wins, 17 defeats and three draws.

Known for his gap-toothed grin, Spinks' battles in the ring contributed to his ill health in later life. It was found he had shrinkage in the brain in 2012 before his cancer diagnosis was confirmed a few years later.

His son Cory, 42, is a former undisputed welterweight champion who also won a world title in the light-middleweight division.

Spinks' younger brother Michael, 64, was undisputed light-heavyweight champion for a period in the 1980s, before moving up to heavyweight, where he won the IBF title and avenged Leon's loss to Holmes."

World number one Dustin Johnson takes a two-shot lead into the final round of the Saudi International after posting a four-under-par 66 on Saturday.

Johnson, 34, produced consecutive birdies on the 17th and 18th holes to go 13 under and move clear of France's Victor Perez who shot a bogey-free 66.

Englishmen Tyrell Hatton and Andy Sullivan are in a group of four who sit in joint third, all on 10 under.

Scotsman Stephen Gallacher shot two over and dropped from first to 14th.

The Masters Champion picked up four birdies in his opening 10 holes but then dropped his first shots of the tournament on the par-four 13th after finding the water, before atoning for the double bogey with his late birdies.

""It was a good finish,"" he said. ""I felt like I played really well all day, other than 13, but I didn't think I hit that bad a shot,""

England 6-11 Scotland: Finn Russell orchestrates first Scottish win at Twickenham since 1983,"Last updated on .From the section Rugby Union

Guinness Six Nations: England v Scotland England: (6) 6 Pens: Farrell 2 Scotland: (8) 11 Try: Van der Merwe Pens: Russell 2

Scotland claimed a first win at Twickenham since 1983 as returning fly-half Finn Russell orchestrated a shock 11-6 Six Nations victory over England.

Capitalising on the hosts' ill discipline, Russell gave Scotland a three-point lead before helping to set up Duhan van der Merwe's try.

Defending champions England clawed back six points and Russell's charge was briefly halted by a yellow card.

But a resilient Scotland were undeterred and added another penalty.

England had been favourites to win the tournament but, with France having opened their Six Nations with a 50-10 defeat of Italy, their chances suddenly seem much slimmer.

Scotland, on the other hand, look likely to improve on last year's fourth-place finish with Wales their opponents at Murrayfield next weekend.

That is one of three home games for the Scots in the 2021 Six Nations, with round three's trip to Paris now looking decisive for their title hopes.

Scotland bear burden of Twickenham history

Wing Duhan van der Merwe scored Scotland's only try

There was no shortage of history surrounding the Calcutta Cup match. It marked the 150th anniversary of the first time England and Scotland played each other and the fact Scotland were without a win at Twickenham in 38 years was a key talking point in the build-up.

All the players had been confined to coronavirus bubbles in the week before the tournament, with England only allowed to socialise outside or otherwise stay alone in their rooms.

The joy of breaking free of their confines combined with the sense of occasion meant both sides sprung out onto the Twickenham pitch, but it was Scotland who looked keenest, determined to throw off the shackles of such a long winless run south of the border.

England, who fielded a relatively inexperienced front row with three experienced props absent, proceeded to concede four penalties in the first five minutes.

The fourth gave Russell - who was returning to international duty after a shoulder injury - the chance to put Scotland ahead.

England's lack of attacking prowess drew criticism in their victorious Autumn Nations Cup campaign and they had promised better in 2021, but it was the visitors who shone in that area as debutant Cameron Redpath made repeated breaks.

England 6-11 Scotland: Stuart Hogg 'chuffed' as Scotland re-write history at Twickenham

For the hosts, the misdemeanours continued. On the eighth penalty conceded, referee Brace had had enough and sent number eight Billy Vunipola to the sin-bin after catching him offside.

As England's penalty count entered double digits, the visitors got their just reward.

It started with Russell and travelled through a who's who of Scotland's backline, the excellent Stuart Hogg, Redpath and hooker George Turner combining to feed Van der Merwe, who stepped inside and powered over near the left corner.

The celebrations were briefly halted as Scotland gave away a penalty and England captain Owen Farrell sent the ball over from just inside his own half.

As Farrell lined up a second penalty, he suggested the television match official reviewed a trip by Russell on England scrum-half Ben Youngs - leading to a yellow card for the talismanic 10.

After Russell had left the field, Farrell scored his penalty and cut Scotland's lead to two.

Scotland keep up unrelenting pressure

England 6-11 Scotland: Gregor Townsend delighted for players after famous Six Nations win

Less optimistic Scotland fans might have thought their side would unravel with Russell off the pitch but, after gathering their thoughts at half-time, the visitors continued to look threatening without their main man.

Some had said that at an empty Twickenham and with several England leaders missing, this was Scotland's best chance of a win since 1983.

England boss Eddie Jones questioned before the match whether that expectation might become ""heavy"" for the Scots, but they looked to be carrying their lead lightly as the second half wore on.

In the absence of Russell, Hogg stepped up to show he had his own box of tricks. A sublime kick to the corner meant Van der Merwe came close to another try and, although Scotland did not get five points, they were rewarded with the return of their fly-half.

Not only were Scotland outplaying England in attack, they were outgunning them at their own kicking game with Hogg continuing to make good use of his boot.

England's defence managed to avoid further embarrassment by halting a Scotland maul a few metres out and Redpath continued to show his quality.

The centre - son of former Scotland captain Bryan - surely caught the eye of British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland in the stands as he stole the ball from Tom Curry on the floor, much to the delight of the Scottish bench.

The Scots did not let up and if anything their pace only became more relentless as the end drew near. Jonny Gray lifted England wing Jonny May off the ground to win a maul, Russell tried for one more drop-goal, but it was not to be.

The final whistle blew and it could almost have been a Scotland home game. All that could be heard at Twickenham were the cheers of every single member of the travelling Scottish side.

Man of the match: Finn Russell

There were men of the match all over the pitch for Scotland but Finn Russell - pictured here with the Calcutta Cup lid on his head - stole the show despite his yellow card.

'There's a lot more to come'- what they said

England head coach Eddie Jones told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""They played tough, edged the set-piece, won in the air and we just could not get in the game. We were not at the races today.

""I take responsibility - I didn't prepare the team well enough. We just had one of those days. We don't have many, but we had a bad day today.""

Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There was a calmness on and off the field. I don't know whether it's because there's no crowd.

""It felt like the players were in control today. We had a bit of defence to do at the end but the players stood up well. I'm very proud of the performance and there's a lot more to come from the players.""

'One of the best Scotland performances ever' - analysis

Former Scotland scrum-half Andy Nicol on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""That is one of the best performances Scotland have ever put in.

""There was creativity, physicality, good kicking and an intensity and togetherness - the win was fully deserved.

""That is as dominant a performance from Scotland against England there has been for over 30 years. It was outstanding, an unbelievably good 80-minute performance.""

Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""What a fabulous tournament we are part of. Not winning for 38 years, then to bring a performance like this. I have never seen a Scotland performance like this. Total dominance in all areas, full stop. Scotland fans should quite rightly be celebrating long into the night.""

Golf on the moon: Apollo 14 50th anniversary images find Alan Shepard's ball and show how far he hit it,"Last updated on .From the section Golf

This image consists of six photographs taken from the Lunar Module, enhanced and stitched into a single panorama to show the landing scene, along with the location from where Shepard hit the balls

Fifty years ago this week, Alan Shepard famously hit two golf balls on the Moon.

The first he shanked into a crater. The second he claimed to have smashed ""miles and miles and miles"".

Now, while all golfers are prone to hyperbole, Shepard, who was commander of Nasa's Apollo 14 mission, could well have hit his ball that far on 6 February 1971 - despite only using a makeshift six iron that he had fashioned out of a collapsible tool designed to scoop lunar rock samples, and which he had sneaked aboard in a sock.

The clubhead Shepard sneaked on board Apollo 14 in a sock and the implement he attached it to - this image is reproduced courtesy of the United States Golf Association which has the item in its museum as part of the Moon shot collection

The only footage that exists is grainy video shot side-on from one television camera. And there was no ball-tracking technology.

But imaging specialist Andy Saunders has digitally enhanced recent high-resolution scans of the original photographic film, and applied a stacking technique on smaller 16mm 'movie' footage shot by the crew.

And not only did he manage to find the second ball, which had not been seen in 50 years, he also worked out how far it actually went.

The Moon's reduced gravity would certainly have helped and Saunders says big-hitting US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau could, theoretically, blast a ball 3.41 miles in the rarefied air - pretty much the length of an 18-hole golf course - with a hangtime of one minute and 22 seconds, were he to take his quest for more distance to extreme lengths.

So, how far did Shepard manage to hit his ball?

""Looked like a slice to me, Al,"" quipped Fred Haise in Mission Control after watching Shepard's first shot that he hit into a nearby crater. Given the known location of the TV camera, Shepard's bootprints can be identified, showing his stance for his first two attempts - when he took ""more dirt than ball"".

""We can now fairly accurately determine that ball number one travelled 24 yards, and ball number two travelled 40 yards,"" says Cheshire-based Saunders, who has been working with the United States Golf Association (USGA) external-link to mark the anniversary.

""Unfortunately, even the impressive second shot could hardly be described as 'miles and miles and miles', but of course this has only ever been regarded as a light-hearted exaggeration.""

Using a known scale from images taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a spacecraft launched in 2009 that took this photo in 2011, the point between divot and ball can then be measured.

While those distances may appear underwhelming, it is still an astonishing feat by Shepard, who in 1961 was the first American to travel into space, a decade before he became the fifth man to walk on the moon.

""The moon is effectively one giant, unraked, rock-strewn bunker,"" continues Saunders.

""The pressurised suits severely restricted movement, and due to their helmet's visors they struggled to even see their feet.

""I would challenge any club golfer to go to their local course and try to hit a six-iron, one-handed, with a one-quarter swing out of an unraked bunker.

""Then imagine being fully suited, helmeted and wearing thick gloves. Remember also that there was little gravity to pull the clubhead down toward the ball.

""The fact that Shepard even made contact and got the ball airborne is extremely impressive.""

Covax: Canada defends taking vaccines from sharing scheme,"Covax: Canada defends taking vaccines from sharing scheme Published 5 days ago

image copyright Reuters image caption Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced pressure to roll out vaccines faster, after delays

Canada has defended its decision to draw on a supply of coronavirus vaccines from a global inoculation-sharing initiative known as Covax.

Covax pools funds from wealthier countries to help buy vaccines for themselves and low-income nations.

The scheme has announced a plan to deliver more than 330 million vaccine doses in the first half of 2021.

Canada is the only member of the G7 group of rich countries listed as a Covax beneficiary at this stage.

Other wealthier countries, including New Zealand and Singapore, have requested an early allocation as well.

Most of the first doses available, though, will be delivered to low- and middle-income countries.

Many of those countries haven't even started vaccinations. Meanwhile, Canada has vaccinated 2.29% of its population with one dose, including 48% of health workers, government data shows.

Aside from Covax, agreements for 398 million doses of vaccines have been struck by the Canadian government - more than enough to cover the country's population of 37 million.

How has Canada defended the move?

In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CBC News, International Development Minister, Karina Gould, was asked why the country decided to access Covax vaccines now.

""Our top priority is to ensure Canadians have access to vaccines,"" the minister said. ""Covax's objective is to provide vaccines for 20% of the populations of all member states, both self-financing and those who will receive donations.

""Canada made the decision, as other countries have, to take on this first allocation, because we recognise how important it is that all Canadians have access to vaccines.""

Canada is facing temporary delays for the two vaccines currently authorised in the country. That has put Mr Trudeau under pressure to ensure a timely vaccine rollout .

Canada lacks domestic production capacity for vaccines. Moderna is only delivering about 78% of the planned number of doses this week. Pfizer vaccines have also been delayed amid efforts to scale-up European production.

What is Covax and how is it distributing vaccines?

Covax works towards the development, purchase and delivery of vaccines to more than 180 countries.

It was launched in April 2020 and is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), together with the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

Covax released its first vaccine distribution forecast on Wednesday, outlining how many doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines it expected to deliver.

The forecast said the initial batch of about 330 million doses would cover, on average, 3.3% of total populations of 145 participating countries.

The forecast illustrates the challenge of vaccinating the global population against the coronavirus, at a time when access to jabs is limited and highly unequal.

Health experts say that, unless vaccines are shared more equitably, it could be years before the coronavirus is brought under control at a global level.

How many initial Covax doses will Canada get?

Covax's forecast said an initial 1.9 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine will be sent to Canada.

Canada contributed $440m (£324m) to Covax in September, half of which secured doses for itself from about nine vaccines candidates.

The other half goes into a pooled fund to buy doses for 20% of the people in 92 low- and middle-income countries.

But other high-income countries with large stocks of vaccines, including the UK and Israel, were not included on Covax's distribution list.

On Wednesday, Gavi chief executive officer Seth Berkley said the group's most important role is to ""supply vaccines for countries that otherwise wouldn't get access"".

""Does it help when countries that have a lot of bilateral deals don't take doses?"" he asked. ""Of course it helps because that means there are more doses available for others.""

Australian Open: Craig Tiley 'absolutely confident' Grand Slam will go ahead,"Last updated on .From the section Tennis

People connected to the Australian Open queued for coronavirus tests at a Melbourne hotel on Thursday

Australian Open boss Craig Tiley says he is ""absolutely confident"" the Grand Slam will start as planned on Monday, despite 160 players waiting for the outcome of coronavirus tests.

A total of 507 people connected to the event were told to isolate by Melbourne health officials on Wednesday after a hotel worker tested positive.

Play at six warm-up events and the Slam draws were postponed on Thursday.

""We fully expect to keep the original schedule after today,"" said Tiley.

The warm-up events, which are all taking place at Melbourne Park, will resume on Friday.

The women's matches have been reduced to two sets and a first-to-10 match tie-break, although the men's matches will still be played over three sets.

The Australian Open draws have been moved back to Friday at about 03:00 GMT.

The disruption came after it was announced on Wednesday that a 26-year-old man tested positive for Covid-19 after working at the Grand Hyatt hotel where the players affected were staying in a 14-day quarantine.

The security guard tested negative after his final shift at the hotel on 29 January, but returned a positive result after he was tested again on 2 February.

The 160 players, plus their support staff and tournament officials, are deemed to be casual contacts by Victorian state health bosses.

They will be allowed out of isolation once they return a negative test.

British players Dan Evans and Cameron Norrie are among those who stayed in the hotel, but were able to practise on Thursday after receiving negative tests.

Evans, Britain's leading men's player, was due to play in the Murray River Open on Thursday and is now set to play twice on Friday.

""The probability is very low that there will be any issues and we fully expect them all to test negative,"" said Tiley.

""We're absolutely confident the Australian Open will go ahead.""

The Grand Slam tournament was pushed back by three weeks to enable players to quarantine on their arrival in Australia.

Australia has imposed some of the world's toughest restrictions over the past year in a bid to suppress coronavirus.

Months of strict border controls - both internationally and domestically - have helped limit Covid-19 cases to less than 29,000 and deaths to less than 1,000."

Australian Open: Players to go into isolation after hotel coronavirus case,"Last updated on .From the section Tennis

Players, officials and support staff started arriving at the Grand Hyatt hotel in mid-January

Between 500 and 600 Australian Open players, officials and support staff will go into isolation after a worker at one of the event's quarantine hotels tested positive for coronavirus.

Thursday's play at the six warm-up events at Melbourne Park has been cancelled as a result.

But Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said: ""At this stage there is no impact on the tournament proper.""

Players will be free to return to competition after a negative test.

""We will work with everyone involved to facilitate testing as quickly as possible,"" said Australian Open organisers.

The Grand Slam tournament, which was pushed back by three weeks to enable players to quarantine, starts on Monday.

Andrews said a 26-year-old man had tested positive for Covid-19 - which could be the UK strain of the virus - after working at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Melbourne's Central Business District.

The security guard tested negative after his final shift at the hotel on 29 January, but returned a positive result after he was tested again on 2 February.

This was one of the hotels where some of the 1,000 players, officials and support staff stayed to complete a 14-day quarantine period on their arrival in Australia.

Andrews said the 500-600 people connected to the Australian Open were deemed to be ""casual contacts"" of the man.

""This is one case, there is no need for people to be panicked or alarmed,"" said Andrews, who announced the state of Victoria would return to some restrictions including masks to be worn indoors.

""We have proved as a state very successful in managing these sort of outbreaks and issues.""

BBC News Published 4 hours ago

Police have fired rubber bullets at protesters in Myanmar's capital, Nay Pyi Taw, during demonstrations against the coup by the armed forces.

Over the past four days, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets, despite a ban on protests.

The country's elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and members of her party, are under house arrest.

Where is Myanmar?

Myanmar, also known as Burma, is in South East Asia and neighbours Thailand, Laos, Bangladesh, China and India.

It has a population of about 54 million, most of whom are Burmese speakers, although other languages are also spoken. The biggest city is Yangon (Rangoon) but the capital is Nay Pyi Taw.

The main religion is Buddhism. There are many ethnic groups in the country, including Rohingya Muslims.

The country gained independence from Britain in 1948. It was ruled by the armed forces from 1962 until 2011, when a new government began ushering in a return to civilian rule.

Why is Myanmar also known as Burma?

The ruling military changed the country's name from Burma to Myanmar in 1989. The two words mean the same thing but Myanmar is the more formal version.

Some countries, including the UK, initially refused to use the name as a way of denying the regime's legitimacy.

But use of ""Myanmar"" has become increasingly common and in 2016 Ms Suu Kyi said it did not matter which name was used.

What has happened now, and why?

The military is now back in charge and has declared a year-long state of emergency.

It seized control on 1 February following a general election which Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide.

media caption Myanmar coup: What's happened so far?

The armed forces had backed the opposition, who were demanding a rerun of the vote, claiming widespread fraud.

The election commission said there was no evidence to support these claims.

The coup was staged as a new session of parliament was set to open.

Ms Suu Kyi is under house arrest and has been charged with possessing illegally imported walkie-talkies. Many other NLD officials have also been detained.

Who is in charge now?

Power has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing.

He has long wielded significant political influence, successfully maintaining the power of the Tatmadaw - Myanmar's military - even as the country transitioned towards democracy.

image copyright Getty Images image caption Min Aung Hlaing is the leader of the coup

He has received international condemnation and sanctions for his alleged role in the military's attacks on ethnic minorities.

In his first public comments after the coup, Gen Hlaing sought to justify the takeover, saying the military was on the side of the people and would form a ""true and disciplined democracy"".

The military says it will hold a ""free and fair"" election once the state of emergency is over.

How have people reacted?

The protests over the coup have been the largest since the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, when thousands of the country's monks rose up against the military regime.

Protesters include teachers, lawyers, students, bank officers and government workers.

Water cannons have been fired at protesters, and the military has imposed restrictions in some areas, including curfews and limits to gatherings.

Who is Aung San Suu Kyi?

Aung San Suu Kyi became world-famous in the 1990s for campaigning to restore democracy.

She spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010 after organising rallies calling for democratic reform and free elections.

She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize while under house arrest in 1991.

In 2015, she led the NLD to victory in Myanmar's first openly contested election in 25 years.

Ms Suu Kyi's international reputation has suffered greatly as a result of Myanmar's treatment of the Rohingya minority.

Myanmar considers them illegal immigrants and denies them citizenship. Over decades, many have fled the country to escape persecution.

Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to Bangladesh following an army crackdown in 2017.

Ms Suu Kyi appeared before the International Court of Justice in 2019, where she denied allegations that the military had committed genocide.

What has the international reaction been to the coup?

The UK, EU and Australia are among those to have condemned the military takeover.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said it was a ""serious blow to democratic reforms"".

US President Joe Biden has threatened to reinstate sanctions.

However, China blocked a UN Security Council statement condemning the coup. The country, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides to ""resolve differences""."

Australia pull out of South Africa Test tour because of coronavirus concerns,"Last updated on .From the section Cricket

Australia lost 2-1 at home against India in their most recent Test series

Australia have pulled out of their tour of South Africa in February and March because of coronavirus concerns.

The teams were due to play three Tests, subject to bio-secure protocols being agreed.

Cricket Australia said it had ""no choice"" because of the situation in South Africa, where a more contagious variant of the virus has been reported.

It means New Zealand have qualified for the inaugural World Test Championship final in England this summer.

""This decision has not been made lightly,"" said Cricket Australia interim CEO Nick Hockley.

""It has become clear that travelling from Australia to South Africa at this current time poses an unacceptable level of health and safety risk to our players, support staff and the community.""

Director of cricket Graeme Smith said Cricket South Africa (CSA) was ""extremely disappointed by the decision"".

He added: ""To be informed about the decision at the 11th hour is frustrating.""

South Africa has been the worst-hit country in Africa, with more than 1.4 million coronavirus cases and 44,000 deaths.

England withdrew midway through their limited-overs tour of South Africa in December after a number of positive cases.

Australia had named a 19-man squad for the tour, but the schedule had not been confirmed.

CSA chief medical officer Dr Shuaib Manjra said the safety protocols proposed were ""unprecedented"", with two grounds and two hotels to be bio-secure.

South Africa hosted a two-Test home series against Sri Lanka in a bio-secure environment in December and January, and Pakistan's women are currently touring the country.

Acting CEO Pholetsi Moseki said the cancellation had caused a ""serious financial loss"" and ""will have a serious impact on the sustainability of the less wealthy cricket playing nations""."

Covid vaccine update: Those that work - and the others on the way,"Covid vaccine update: Those that work - and the others on the way By James Gallagher

Health and science correspondent Published 6 days ago

Covid vaccination campaigns are now under way in the UK and across the world.

A range of vaccines is being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying.

Two more vaccines have also just been shown to work in large-scale clinical trials.

Why do we need a vaccine?

It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet the vast majority of people are still vulnerable.

The restrictions on our lives are the only thing holding the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread.

Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic.

The big three - Pfizer/BioNtech, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca

The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca.

Pfizer and Moderna have both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design.

They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence.

These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US.

The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe.

It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.

All three are supposed to be given as two doses, but the UK is prioritising giving as many people as possible the first dose and delaying the second.

Janssen and Novavax

Results from large-scale trials on two new vaccines have also been presented recently.

The work by Janssen and Novavax will now be reviewed by drugs regulators before their jabs can be approved.

Janssen's vaccine uses the same technique as Oxford, but crucially is given as a single injection, rather than two. This, combined with it needing only a fridge to store and a billion doses planned this year, means it could make a significant impact around the world.

Novavax is using a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body.

What is the rest of the world doing?

There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US.

The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.

The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.

The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.

Are they all equally effective?

It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic.

However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.

Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown.

Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.

What about variants?

New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world.

However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants.

Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.

The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.

We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

What still needs to be done?

Huge-scale manufacturing to produce billions of doses and distribute them around the world

Ethiopian and Eritrean forces have waged a ""devastating and genocidal war"" in Ethiopia's Tigray region, the region's ousted leader has said.

Debretsion Gebremichael urged the international community to investigate the alleged atrocities.

The Ethiopian government said his claims were ""unfounded"", and his forces were guilty of ""horrendous crimes"".

Conflict broke out in November after Mr Debretsion's forces captured Ethiopian government military bases in Tigray.

Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy responded by ordering a ground and air offensive, which led to his troops capturing the regional capital, Mekelle, on 28 November.

Mr Debretsion fled the capital with fighters from his Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and vowed to resist federal control over the region.

The conflict has led to about two million people, or a third of Tigray's population, being displaced.

What exactly did the TPLF leader say?

This was the first time in more than two months that Mr Debretsion had spoken in public. An audio recording of his comments, lasting for about 20 minutes, was broadcast on a Facebook account run by a TPLF media outlet.

""A devastating and genocidal war was waged against the people of Tigray because they firmly fought for their right to self-determination and they held a democratic election. The invasion and massacre has continued. So does the struggle of the people of Tigray,"" he said.

Mr Debretsion also alleged widespread incidents of murder, rape, torture and starvation.

It is unclear when the recording was made but he mentioned the killings of other TPLF leaders, which suggested it was recent.

Mr Debretsion is wanted by the government on charges of treason.

The authorities announced earlier this month that several senior TPLF members, including Ethiopia's former Foreign Minster Seyoum Mesfin, had been killed in the conflict.

Mr Debretsion said the TPLF had suffered setbacks because ""four governments"" were fighting against it in Tigray.

""Abiy Ahmed invited forces, including the Eritrean army, and they are massacring the people of Tigray.

""The atrocities should be investigated and all legal actions should be taken against the invading forces,"" he said.

media caption Three consequences of the ongoing crisis in Tigray

The Eritrean and Ethiopian governments have previously denied that Eritrean troops are involved in the conflict.

But the US state department said last week that Eritrean troops were in Tigray, and they should immediately withdraw.

""Credible reports"" had emerged of their involvement in human rights abuses, including sexual violence and looting, the state department said.

Mr Debretsion did not name the other countries allegedly involved in the conflict. Somalia has previously denied that its troops have been fighting alongside Ethiopian forces in Tigray.

The TPLF had also previously alleged that drones from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were being used to strike at its forces, but Ethiopia denied that the Gulf state was involved in the conflict.

What has been the government's reaction to the genocide claims?

A spokeswoman for Mr Abiy, Billene Seyoum, told the BBC that she could not ""speak to the delusions of a criminal clique's Facebook page"".

""With regards to the rule of law operations, the criminal clique and their international proxies have been attempting to divert international attention by [making] unfounded claims of genocide as early as November to cover up the TPLF's horrendous crimes,"" Billene Seyoum said.

The international community and media needed to support the government's efforts to bring the TPLF to justice ""instead of covering up for them"", she added.

How bad is the conflict?

It has been difficult to verify information about alleged atrocities because of media restrictions and a communication blackout in areas hit by conflict in the mountainous region.

However, rights bodies and aid agencies have reported the killing of civilians, as well as widespread damage and looting of homes, businesses, hospitals and food stores.

A government official, quoted in a leaked copy of notes taken at a meeting of humanitarian workers, said that ""hundreds of thousands might starve to death"", and that some people had already died.

The government has said it is doing its best to deliver food to people.

What is the background to the conflict?

image copyright Getty Images image caption Buildings in Tigray's agricultural hub of Humera were shelled in November

Apart from ruling in Tigray, the TPLF had been the dominant party in a coalition government at federal level until Mr Abiy took office in 2018, following mass protests against its authoritarian rule.

The party held elections in Tigray last September, in defiance of a decision at federal level to postpone all polls because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Mr Abiy then accused the TPLF of being illegally in power, while it accused him of leading an ""illegitimate"" government that no longer had a mandate to govern."
Covid-19: How the vaccine will reach your arm,"Covid-19: How the vaccine will reach your arm

Scroll down to find out how those vaccines got from the science lab to people's arms in record time.

An unprecedented global scientific effort has led to the development of a number of coronavirus vaccines, which promise to help protect the world's most vulnerable from the devastating disease Covid-19.

Time, and the close monitoring of those who have received the jab, will then tell us how long that protection is likely to last.

Inside our bodies the vaccine begins to train our immune system to fight coronavirus whenever we encounter it, with the hope of preventing us from getting sick from the devastating disease, Covid-19.

Once in a syringe, the solution is injected into the upper arm of a patient, where its real work begins.

Frozen vaccines require defrosting and some also need diluting before being ready for use.

Trained staff at vaccine centres receive these smaller batches and ensure they are stored correctly ready for patients.

Supplies may also make another pit stop at regional storage sites before heading to clinics.

Once cleared by testers, smaller batches are transported again in temperature-controlled vehicles to hospitals, pharmacies, clinics and other vaccination teams.

The Pfizer vaccine requires specialist freezers and a number of countries have set up freezer farms - depots containing large numbers of deep freezers - to keep it safe.

Once a vaccine reaches a destination country it is batch-tested for quality at a secure site before being distributed.

Governments in high-income countries have placed massive orders for multiple vaccines, but the World Health Organization has set up a scheme - the Covax programme - to ensure vulnerable people in low and middle income countries also receive supplies.

Making sure that the vaccines are available to those who need them most, not just those who can afford to buy them, is crucial to ending the global pandemic.

However, the British-made Oxford-AstraZenca vaccine can be kept at normal fridge temperatures, so faces fewer challenges and can use established cold chains used for other drugs.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, for example, needs to be stored at a very cold -70C.

Most traditional vaccines need to be kept at between 2C and 8C, but some of the Covid-19 jabs require it to be much colder.

Once released by manufacturers, vaccines are shipped via a ""cold chain"" to ensure they are always kept at the right temperature.

These large batches of vaccine are checked for quality before being put into to vials in a sterile production plant and shipped.

Something that improves the immune response - known as an ""adjuvant"" - is also often included.

The process of making a vaccine involves producing the active ingredient in large quantities and mixing it with other ingredients, such as stabilisers.

This meant when safe and effective vaccines were found and approved, companies were ready to distribute them as quickly as possible.

But with Covid vaccines, manufacturing capacity was built up much earlier - while research and development was still in progress - because of the large amounts of cash backing the quest.

Usually it is at this point - once a medicine has been approved - that pharmaceutical companies begin to scale up production.

To speed up approval, the UK regulator used a system called ""rolling review"". When enough data was available from ongoing trials it was assessed immediately, rather than in one dump at the end.

These organisations and their scientists critically assessed each vaccine's safety, quality and effectiveness to decide whether to give it the green light.

The results of the successful trials were then sent for approval to bodies that regulate the safe use of medicines.

While it usually takes up to 10 years to conduct these trials, for Covid-19 the phases ran simultaneously to speed things up.

Once these lab-based trials were completed, the vaccines were then given to volunteers across the world to ensure they were safe and effective but also to calculate dosage.

Researchers tested these antigens using computer models and cells in the lab, monitoring side-effects.

Most of the successful jabs contain tiny, harmless fragments of the virus or blueprints for making those fragments inside our bodies.

Researchers studied the virus in detail to identify an antigen - a tiny part of it that would trigger our body's immune response.

Many had studied other recent coronaviruses that had caused Sars and Mers - so had a head start.

Collaborating like never before, teams across the world worked on multiple stages of development at the same time - compressing 10 years' work into less than 12 months.

Scientists began the quest to find a vaccine against the new coronavirus when its genetic sequence was released in January 2020.

Most traditional vaccines need to be kept at between 2C and 8C, but some of the Covid-19 jabs require it to be much colder.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, for example, needs to be stored at a very cold -70C.

However, the British-made Oxford-AstraZenca vaccine can be kept at normal fridge temperatures, so faces fewer challenges and can use established cold chains used for other drugs.

Making sure that the vaccines are available to those who need them most, not just those who can afford to buy them, is crucial to ending the global pandemic.

Governments in high-income countries have placed massive orders for multiple vaccines, but the World Health Organization has set up a scheme - the Covax programme - to ensure vulnerable people in low and middle income countries also receive supplies.

Doses are taken from central hubs to vaccine centres

Once a vaccine reaches a destination country it is batch-tested for quality at a secure site before being distributed.

The Pfizer vaccine requires specialist freezers and a number of countries have set up freezer farms - depots containing large numbers of deep freezers - to keep it safe.

Once cleared by testers, smaller batches are transported again in temperature-controlled vehicles to hospitals, pharmacies, clinics and other vaccination teams.

Supplies may also make another pit stop at regional storage sites before heading to clinics.

Vaccine centres deliver the vaccine to patients

Trained staff at vaccine centres receive these smaller batches and ensure they are stored correctly ready for patients.

Frozen vaccines require defrosting and some also need diluting before being ready for use.

Once in a syringe, the solution is injected into the upper arm of a patient, where its real work begins.

Inside our bodies the vaccine begins to train our immune system to fight coronavirus whenever we encounter it, with the hope of preventing us from getting sick from the devastating disease, Covid-19.

Time, and the close monitoring of those who have received the jab, will then tell us how long that protection is likely to last."

What's behind the China-Taiwan divide?,"What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Published 29 January

image copyright AFP

The Chinese Government sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be part of the country again.

While some Taiwanese think this might happen in the future, others now feel that they already effectively have a separate nation whether or not independence is ever officially declared.

The dispute with China has left relations frayed with a constant threat of a violent flare up that could drag the US into the fray.

What is the history and source of this tension?

The first known settlers in Taiwan are Austronesian tribal people thought to have come from modern day southern China.

The island first appears in Chinese records in AD239, when China sent an expeditionary force to explore - a fact Beijing uses to back its territorial claim.

After a brief spell as a Dutch colony (1624-1661) Taiwan was administered by China's Qing dynasty from 1683 to 1895.

From the 17th Century, significant numbers of migrants started arriving from China, often fleeing turmoil or hardship. Most were Hoklo Chinese from Fujian (Fukien) province or Hakka Chinese, largely from Guangdong. The descendants of these two migrations now make up by far the largest population group.

In 1895, following Japan's victory in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government had to cede Taiwan to Japan. After World War Two, the Republic of China - one of the victors - began ruling Taiwan with the consent of its allies the US and UK, after Japan surrendered and relinquished control of territory it had taken from China.

However in the next few years, a civil war broke out in China and the leader at the time Chiang Kai-shek's troops were beaten back by the Communist armies under Mao Zedong.

image copyright Central Press image caption Chiang Kai-shek, once the leader in China, fled with his supporters to Taiwan

Chiang and the remnants of his Kuomintang (KMT) government fled to Taiwan in 1949. This group, referred to as Mainland Chinese and then making up 1.5m people, dominated Taiwan's politics for many years, even though they only account for 14% of the population.

Having inherited an effective dictatorship, facing resistance from local people resentful of authoritarian rule, and under pressure from a growing democracy movement, Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, began allowing a process of democratisation, which eventually led to the 2000 election of the island's first non-KMT president, Chen Shui-bian.

Where are things at now?

Relations between China and Taiwan started improving in the 1980s. China put forward a formula, known as ""one country, two systems"", under which Taiwan would be given significant autonomy if it accepted Chinese reunification.

This system was established in Hong Kong to be used as something of a showcase to entice Taiwanese people back to the mainland but over the last year it has come under massive pressure with many analysts already questioning whether it still exists in the city.

In Taiwan, the offer was rejected, but Taipei did relax rules on visits to and investment in China. It also, in 1991, proclaimed the war with the People's Republic of China on the mainland to be over.

There were also limited talks between the two sides' unofficial representatives, though Beijing's insistence that Taiwan's Republic of China (ROC) government is illegitimate prevented government-to-government contact.

image copyright AFP image caption Chen Shui-ban was a backer of independence for Taiwan from China

Beijing became alarmed in 2000, when Taiwan elected as president Chen Shui-bian, who had openly backed ""independence"".

Mr Chen was re-elected in 2004, prompting China to pass a so-called anti-secession law in 2005, stating China's right to use ""non-peaceful means"" against Taiwan if it tried to ""secede"" from China.

In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou was elected president. He sought to improve relations with China, mainly through economic agreements.

In elections in January 2016, Tsai Ing-wen defeated Kuomintang party candidate Eric Chu. She leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leans towards eventual official independence from China.

image copyright Reuters image caption Under Ms Tsai, cross-straits relations soured again

After Donald Trump won the 2016 US election, she spoke to the president-elect in a phone call, in what was a break with US policy set in 1979 when formal relations were cut. Despite the lack of formal relations, the US has an agreement to supply Taiwan with defensive weapons and has stressed any any attack by China would cause ""grave concern"".

Throughout 2018, China stepped up pressure on international companies forcing them to list Taiwan as a part of China on their websites and threatening to block them for doing business in China if they failed to comply.

In 2020, Ms Tsai won a second term. By that time, Hong Kong had seen months of unrest with protesters demonstrating against the mainland's increasing influence - a trend that had many in Taiwan worried Beijing would next set its eyes on Taiwan.

Later that year, China's implementation of a national security law in Hong Kong was seen by many as a yet another sign that Beijing was becoming significantly more assertive in the region.

In the meantime, the US has been intensifying its outreach to Taiwan, reassuring Taipei of its continued support,

In September, Washington sent its highest-ranking politician to hold meetings on the island for decades.

Beijing strongly criticised the meeting, warning ""not to send any wrong signals to 'Taiwan independence' elements to avoid severe damage to China-US relations"". During the controversial visit, China conducted a live-fire military exercise in the waterway that separates the island from the mainland.

President Joe Biden's administration has said its commitment to Taiwan is ""rock solid"".

In the first few days of Mr Biden's presidency, Taiwan reported a ""large incursion"" by Chinese warplanes over two days. Taiwan's air force moved to warn away the Chinese aircraft and deployed air defence missile systems to monitor the planes. Analysts said China was testing Mr Biden's support for Taiwan.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby responded by saying: ""We have obligations to assist Taiwan with their self-defence and I think you're going to see that continue.""

So what is Taiwan?

There is disagreement and confusion about what Taiwan is, and even what it should be called.

China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province which it has vowed to retake, by force if necessary. But Taiwan's leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state.

It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces.

Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China (ROC) government, which fled the mainland to Taiwan in 1949, at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China's seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government.

But in 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing and the ROC government was forced out. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government diplomatically has fallen drastically to about 15.

Given the huge divide between these two positions, most other countries seem happy to accept the current ambiguity, whereby Taiwan has virtually all of the characteristics of an independent state, even if its legal status remains unclear.

How much of an issue is independence in Taiwan?

While political progress has been slow, links between the two peoples and economies have grown sharply. Taiwanese companies have invested about $60bn (£40bn) in China, and up to one million Taiwanese now live there, many running Taiwanese factories.

Some Taiwanese worry their economy is now dependent on China. Others point out that closer business ties makes Chinese military action less likely, because of the cost to China's own economy.

A controversial trade agreement sparked the ""Sunflower Movement"" in 2014 where students and activists occupied Taiwan's parliament protesting against what they call China's growing influence over Taiwan.

image copyright AFP/Getty Images image caption Some Taiwanese vocally support formal independence but most favour the middle ground

Officially, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) still favours eventual formal independence for Taiwan, while the KMT favours eventual re-unification. Opinion polls show only a small minority of Taiwanese support pursuing one or the other at the moment, with most preferring to stick with the current middle ground.

Yet more and more people say they feel Taiwanese rather than Chinese. Support for the DPP increased at the January 2016 election. This was partly because of dissatisfaction with the KMT's handling of economic matters, from the wealth gap to high housing prices, and partly because of worries that Mr Ma's administration was making Taiwan too dependent on Beijing.

What we know about the South African Covid-19 variant,"Early in its existence, Covid-19 gained an ability that would prove decisive in its relationship with human beings. The virus picked up a seemingly small change in its genetic code. It was likely an unfortunate accident – a fragment of genetic information from another virus got muddled up with that of the coronavirus while they were both infecting a bat.

Included within this tiny piece of genome, however, were the instructions that altered a key part of the virus – its spike protein. This important protein studs the outside of the coronavirus and is the part that attaches to the outside of cells, helping the rest of the virus to sneak inside where it can replicate.

This change to Covid-19's spike protein meant it could hijack an enzyme found in the human body called furin. This enzyme acts like a pair of molecular scissors, normally cutting open hormones and growth factors to activate them. But when furin snips part of the Covid-19 spike protein, which is normally folded in a series of loops on the outside of the virus, it opens like a hinge.

""This exposes a new sequence in the spike protein,"" says Yohei Yamauchi, a reader in viral cell biology at the University of Bristol, UK, who has been studying how this change may have led Covid-19 to become more infective in humans. ""It is one of the changes that make this virus really different from previous coronaviruses that caused Sars and Mers.""

This new mutation meant Covid-19 could suddenly latch onto an important molecule found scattered around the outside of human respiratory cells called Neuropilin 1. This molecule helps to transport material inside cells and deeper into tissues – the mutation was like handing Covid-19 the keys to a new door into our cells and meant the virus could replicate in greater numbers in the human airways.

Although this mutation was just one in Covid-19's short existence, it proved to be important. Some researchers believe it may be one of the key mutations that allowed the coronavirus to jump species and begin causing a rapidly spreading disease in humans. But almost as soon as it did this, it began picking up other mutations."

Tokyo 2020: International Olympic Committee targets 'safe and successful' Games,"The Olympic Games were originally due to run from 24 July to 9 August last year

The International Olympic Committee ""is fully concentrated and committed to the successful and safe delivery"" of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics this year despite the Covid-19 pandemic, IOC president Thomas Bach says.

The German said all stakeholders, including the Japanese government, were ""fully united and committed"" to going ahead with the rearranged Games.

Despite much of Japan being under a state of emergency because of a third wave of Covid, the Olympics are set to commence on 23 July.

Bach said there was ""no blueprint"" for trying to organise the first rearranged Games during an ongoing pandemic, which he said has ""multiplied"" the complexity of staging the events.

But he did admit for the first time that there may be no crowds at the event.

""This I cannot tell you. We will do whatever is needed to organise a safe Games"" he said.

'Working on how Tokyo 2020 goes ahead'

""We are learning every day,"" he continued. ""This fight against the virus is a tough one, but we are fighting this fight for and like Olympic athletes.

""This means with full determination, with a will to win, with hard work every day, and with all the physical and mental strength that we can have.""

Bach again dismissed the idea of a ""Plan B"", talk of relocating the events, and cancellation.

""We are not speculating whether the Games are taking place, we are working how the Games will take place,"" he said.

When asked at what stage it would consider calling off the Olympics, Bach replied: ""Our task is to organise Olympic Games and not to cancel Olympic Games. This is why we are working day and night to organise safe Olympic Games.""

'Covid playbooks for Olympics'

Bach called for ""patience and understanding"", saying it was in the interests of athletes, the national Olympic committees, the Japanese people and organisers ""to be diligent"".

The IOC is now issuing ""the first versions"" of its Covid safety ""playbooks for the Games"".

""The athletes, everyone can trust that we are providing the facts and our planned counter measures as the situation develops,"" Bach said.

He added that ""every possible scenario"" is being considered and that the IOC is taking safety advice from Japanese and world health bodies, while also taking to vaccine manufacturers.

Bach, a former fencing gold medallist who has been president of the IOC since 2013, warned that constant speculation about the Olympics and Paralympics taking place ""is hurting athletes"".

"Independent Spirit Awards: Michaela Coel, Carey Mulligan among nominees","Independent Spirit Awards: Michaela Coel, Carey Mulligan among nominees Published 27 January

image copyright PA/Getty image caption Riz Ahmed, Michaela Coel, and Carey Mulligan are all up for awards

British actors Riz Ahmed, Carey Mulligan and Michaela Coel were among the nominees for this year's Independent Spirit Awards.

The awards honour the best in independent film; and often indicate who could win an Oscar.

Ahmed was nominated in the male lead category for his portrayal of a heavy metal drummer struggling with losing his hearing in Sound Of Metal.

Mulligan was recognised for her role as Cassie in Promising Young Woman.

The film - the directorial debut by star of The Crown and best director/best screenplay nominee Emerald Fennell - sees Mulligan's character seeking to avenge her best friend's rape.

image copyright Getty Images image caption Promising Young Woman star Carey Mulligan and director Emerald Fennell are both nominated

Ahmed is nominated in the same category as the late Chadwick Boseman for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. The drama, about a blues singer, is up against First Cow and Minari for the best feature gong, as well as Never Rarely Sometimes Always and Nomadland.

The nominees were announced in a video shared online on Tuesday evening; hosted by directors Olivia Wilde and Barry Jenkins, and actress Laverne Cox.

One of the awards that has already been decided on is best ensemble cast in a new scripted TV series, which went to Coel and her co-stars in I May Destroy You.

The drama series finds protagonist Arabella trying to piece her life back together after being sexually assaulted on a night out.

The show is also up for best new scripted series, in a field which includes Sir Steve McQueen's Small Axe anthology series, chronicling the lives of West Indian immigrants in London from the 1960s to the 1980s.

Both Small Axe and I May Destroy You could go on to be recognised at the Golden Globe nominations next week, which cover both film and TV.

How do the Independent Spirits relate to the Oscars?

image copyright Caviar image caption Ahmed plays Ruben in Sound of Metal

The Independent Spirit Awards ceremony usually takes place on the beach in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, on the eve of the Academy Awards.

But this year, due to the disruption caused by Covid-19, they will take place on 22 April - the Thursday before the big Sunday night.

There is often some overlap between the winners at the Independent Spirit Awards and the winners at the Academy Awards.

For example, Renée Zellweger was named best actress at both ceremonies for her portrayal of Judy Garland last year.

In 2018, the two ceremonies agreed on three of the four acting category winners - Sam Rockwell, Allison Janney and Frances McDormand.

However, that is not always the case.

Because the Oscars consider all films, and not just those made independently, many movies which do well at the Independent Spirit Awards may not necessarily break through to the the more crowded Academy field.

Last year's main Spirit winners The Farewell, Uncut Gems and Booksmart were all snubbed at the Oscars.

The Academy has said it is exploring how to hold an in-person ceremony, two months later than normal.

Director Steven Soderbergh has been asked to ""re-envision"" this year's event in the wake of the pandemic.

Africa's free-trade area: What difference will it make?,"Africa's free-trade area: What difference will it make? By Basillioh Mutahi & Zawadi Mudibo

BBC News, Nairobi Published 27 January

image copyright Getty Images image caption This factory in Kenya makes face masks but many African nations buy their face masks from China

Africa's free-trade area became reality on 1 January 2021, promising to make it easier to do business across the continent.

The idea, which has been talked about for years, is to create one of the world's biggest free-trade areas, opening up a market of more than 1.2 billion people, with a combined GDP of more than $3 trillion (£2 trillion). This would create business opportunities - and jobs - across Africa, while reducing the cost of some goods in the shops and markets.

The launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area follows years of negotiations and preparations, and more recently faced months of delays due to the global coronavirus pandemic.

What happened on 1 January?

From that date, the 41 countries that had submitted their plans to reduce tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, were able to trade goods under the new rules. Each state or regional trade bloc makes their own plans and that information is eventually hosted on the Africa Trade Observatory (ATO) website.

Under the trade deal, tariffs on 90% of goods will be phased out within 10 years and more for the remaining 10%. This is being done in stages and so could take up to 2035, according to the AfCFTA secretariat.

So has the price of goods in the shops changed?

No, not yet.

For the prices in the shops and markets to change, the taxes on imported goods must go down first. While many of the countries have officially reduced the taxes, and so some of the goods are eligible for the lower tariffs, this is yet to take effect.

image copyright AFP image caption The price of these South Africa oranges might soon fall in Kenya

This is because countries are first required to gazette (or publish in an official record) the specific changes on tariffs and this information is published on the ATO website. Because this process is not yet complete, the duty or taxes being paid has largely not changed. Besides, not all countries that have offered to reduce the import taxes have finalised their customs processes, such as the procedures for presentation, identification and clearance of goods.

""In most cases,"" David Luke, a trade policy expert at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa says, ""the duty will be refunded [later] since the process, including gazetting is in progress"".

But once the reduction in taxes does take effect, which depends on when individual countries complete their processes, the prices of goods should fall.

For example, oranges imported from South Africa for sale in a supermarket in Kenya currently attract a 25% tariff, according to the African Trade Observatory. So if Kenya removes this tax, and all the required processes are ready, the price of those oranges should significantly fall.

Andrew Mold, the head of regional integration and the AfCFTA cluster at Uneca, reckons the price reduction will be quite modest for goods such as food and building materials but there will be more pressure to reduce service sector prices.

""With greater competition, we should see prices come down for services like telecoms, business services and finance,"" he says.

What difference will it make to traders?

It could potentially make a big difference to people trying to export goods from one African country to another.

Mabel Simpson is a creative fashion entrepreneur in Accra, Ghana, who makes items with African prints such as handmade laptop bags, hand bags and pillows. Most of the raw materials she uses are imported and she says that taxes on them make the final products too expensive to sell elsewhere on the continent.

Mabel Simpson If I need to ship an item to the US... it's going to be $25 but if I need to ship the same item to Uganda, it's going to be $60""

Her biggest export markets are currently the United States and the UK, as factors such as import taxes and other costs make goods too expensive to sell elsewhere in Africa.

""If I need to ship an item to the US, if I ship an item that weighs one kilo, it's going to be $25 but if I need to ship the same item to Uganda, it's going to be $60. So, which is cheaper? The USA.""

If she was able to sell her goods profitably in Uganda, and other African countries, she says she would, potentially creating more jobs for her employees in Ghana, and those selling her products elsewhere.

She also says an African free trade area could make her products cheaper because she currently pays taxes on those goods she imports.

""This [AfCFTA] means we are going to be able to produce in numbers and more people are going to be able to afford our products and we are going to be able to be more competitive in Africa,"" she says.

What about bigger firms?

With a large and seamless market for goods, the free-trade area is expected to attract more domestic and foreign investment, fostering industrial growth in the continent.

This is one of the objectives of AfCFTA, which will be the world's largest free trade area by number of countries once it is fully operational.

media caption Could a free-trade deal be a new dawn for Africa?

However, some smaller companies may be worried they will not be able to compete with continental giants and multinationals. The AfCFTA is negotiating a protocol on competition policy this year which aims to create a level playing field for all firms.

The UN and World Trade Organization's joint agency, the International Trade Centre, says that the free trade area could also make it easier for small companies to expand into neighbouring countries.

Small firms could find niche markets but can also specialise as part of the supply chain of larger firms.

Some obstacles still remain, including poor physical infrastructure such as road and railway networks, customs systems, security issues and communication barriers that may yet still pose a problem for the free movement of goods within the continent.

Why is the African Union so keen on a free-trade area?

Basically because trade between African countries is relatively low.

image copyright Getty Images image caption Poor infrastructure and customs delays are other reasons why intra-African trade is so low

For example, Kenya is a major flower exporter but Nigeria imports flowers from the Netherlands. Similarly, palm oil in Kenya is likely to come from Malaysia, rather than Nigeria.

The idea behind the free-trade area is to see Kenyan flowers on the streets of Lagos and Nigerian palm oil for sale in Nairobi.

Across the continent, just 2% of trade was with other African countries in the period 2015-17, compared to 47% in The Americas, 61% in Asia, 67% in Europe and 7% in Oceania, according to UN trade agency, Unctad.

Many countries still do more trade with their former colonial power than they do with their neighbours.

The theory is that if African countries did more business with each other, they would all benefit, creating more jobs and so raising living standards across the continent.

The trade area also seeks to resolve the challenges of multiple and often overlapping membership of regional trade blocs, such as the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), Ecowas in West Africa, Sadc in the south and the East African Community.

So what happens next?

This is just the start of a journey, which could last up to 2035.

The deal, signed by 54 of the African Union's (AU) 55 member states, and ratified by 34 so far, commits countries to remove tariffs on 90% of products within a five-year period.

Trade under AfCFTA cannot yet commence on the remaining 10% of goods, whose negotiations are yet to be finalised, according to Mr Mold of the Uneca.

He notes that the implementation of the free-trade area is a process rather than an event that will take quite some time to fully implement.

Negotiations continue this year, he says, including on the services sector, before the negotiators move to the Phase II issues - such as rights of investors, competition policy, and intellectual property.

""All this is part and parcel of a gradual harmonisation of African trade and investment policies to facilitate much greater levels of intra-African trade and investment,"" he told the BBC.

Why was it delayed?

The global coronavirus pandemic pushed back the implementation of the trade deal that was meant to start in July 2020.

Negotiations have taken years, since 2012 when the African Union launched the plan for establishing a free-trade area.

The closure of economies around the world due to the pandemic, however, is seen as increasing the need for intra-regional trade and integrating African economies which have been heavily dependent on imports from China, Europe, US and elsewhere.

""Covid-19 has demonstrated that Africa is overly reliant on the export of primary commodities, overly reliant on global supply chains,"" said Wamkele Mene, secretary-general of the AfCFTA secretariat during the launch of the free-trade area.

""When the global supply chains are disrupted, we know that Africa suffers.""

Are all countries on board?

In 2018, 44 countries signed the deal while 10 including Africa's biggest economy Nigeria, were initially reluctant to sign, before later agreeing to join up.

Of the 55 countries in the continent, only Eritrea remains to be part of the trading bloc.

A total of 34 countries have ratified the deal and 41 countries and customs unions have submitted their offer to reduce tariffs. That means that nearly all favour the agreement, though countries have made varying levels of commitment."

Covid-19: White House criticises 'chaotic' vaccine rollout,"Covid-19: White House criticises 'chaotic' vaccine rollout Published 24 January

media caption President Biden: ""Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better""

A senior White House official has criticised the Trump administration's rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine calling it ""chaotic"" and ""very limited"".

President Joe Biden's Chief of Staff Ron Klain said there was no plan in the federal government for the distribution of vaccines across the US.

The president, who took office last Wednesday, has promised 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days.

The US has now reported more than 25 million Covid-19 cases.

About 417,500 deaths have been linked to the virus. In recent weeks, the daily number of Covid-linked deaths in the US has, on some days, exceeded 4,000.

President Biden signed a raft of new measures last week, including boosting vaccinations and testing. He has implored Americans to wear masks and warned that the death toll could get much worse.

""Let me be clear - things will continue to get worse before they get better"", he said.

President Biden's efforts follow widespread criticism of the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic and of the vaccination programme.

Vaccines have been distributed to states, and states and cities are carrying out the inoculations. But some have complained they are struggling with supply.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 41 million doses had been distributed by Saturday across the country, but only 20.5 million had been administered.

Speaking to NBC News, Mr Klain said: ""The process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not really exist when we came into the White House.""

He said it was a ""complex"" process but that the Biden administration would set up federal vaccination sites to help states without enough places.

How bad is the situation across the US?

Total cases went over 25 million on Sunday, according to tracking data from Johns Hopkins University.

Infections have spiralled in recent months - with a jump in new infections after Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

Hospital numbers hit their highest levels during the pandemic earlier this month but are slowly starting to drop alongside daily cases.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said on Thursday that rolling average data appeared to show infections levelling off.

Although the national picture has stabilised slightly, he warned the country remained in a ""very serious situation"".

The CDC is particularly concerned that new variants could accelerate the virus spread. It issued a warning that the new more transmissible strain first detected in the UK could become the dominant strain across the US by March.

The strain has been detected in 20 states, Dr Fauci said Thursday, but warned the country had ""limited ability"" to track its spread through the population.

What is being done to combat the virus?

President Biden has already enacted a raft of executive measures to combat the virus and he wants Congress to pass a $1.9tn (£1.4tn) package of economic relief funding.

The president is hoping to get bipartisan approval for his broad stimulus agenda, but the proposal has already been met with scepticism and resistance by some Republicans.

Another one of the new president's key promises is to oversee 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, but some have criticised this policy as not ambitious enough.

""When I announced it, you all said it's not possible,"" Mr Biden said on Thursday when asked if his goal was high enough. ""Come on, give me a break, man. It's a good start.""

The current approved suppliers - Moderna and Pfizer - have pledged to deliver 200 million doses by March. Dr Fauci has also suggested emergency approval of a third vaccine, a single-dose jab by Johnson & Johnson, could be just weeks away.

Dr Fauci, who was appointed chief medical adviser by the new president, has expressed hope that if 70-85% of the US population is vaccinated by the end of summer, the country could ""approach a degree of normality"" by autumn.

""It's not going to be perfectly normal, but one that I think will take a lot of pressure off the American public,"" he told a White House briefing."

Covid: Why won't vaccinating the vulnerable end lockdown?,"Covid: Why won't vaccinating the vulnerable end lockdown? Nick Triggle

Health correspondent

The prime minister says it is too soon to say whether lockdown will be lifted in the spring.

But with the most vulnerable to be offered vaccination by mid-February, what is standing in the way?

The NHS will still be at risk

Lockdown looks to be having an impact on infection levels with the number of new cases starting to fall.

But there are only tentative signs this has filtered through to a slowing of new admissions to hospital.

And even if they start coming down, the overall number of patients in hospital will remain high as patients are being discharged at a much slower rate than they are coming in.

Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, predicts hospitals will remain under the current ""intense pressure"" perhaps until the end of February.

With no headroom in the NHS, ministers will be cautious about lifting many of the restrictions, especially with the threat of the new faster-spreading variant.

Vaccine supply is fragile

There are no guarantees the government will meet the mid-February target.

The UK has certainly made a good start. Per head of population, only Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have vaccinated more.

Over the past week more than two million people have received their first dose.

That puts the government on track for achieving its aim of offering a vaccine to everyone over 70, the extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care workers.

But the supply chain remains fragile. Pfizer has announced a slowdown in manufacturing for the next couple of weeks so it can upgrade its facilities and ramp up production in the spring.

The UK is less reliant on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine than other countries, as we manufacture the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here.

There are millions of doses already made but not all of it has been through the final packaging process or safety checks.

Ensuring this happens will be crucial to allowing the NHS to keep its foot on the accelerator, especially as the vaccination clinics will have to start factoring in giving second doses from late February onwards.

Those close to the programme say it will be ""touch and go"" especially if extra supplies of the Pfizer vaccine do not come back on stream as quick as the company is saying they will.

There will be lots of vulnerable still at risk

Even if the supply is good, there will still be lots of vulnerable people.

Nearly 90% of Covid deaths have been in the groups due to get the jab by mid-February.

But no vaccine is 100% effective and uptake will not be 100%.

What is more there will still be many vulnerable people in the over-60s age group.

As we get further into spring, everyone over the age of 50, as well as younger adults with health conditions, will be offered a vaccine.

But even that may not be enough, according to some.

Modelling by the University of Warwick suggests that, even with 85% uptake, a complete lifting of restrictions in April could lead to very high levels of deaths.

""Vaccines are not a panacea,"" says Prof Matt Keeling, who led the research.

And for younger age groups, who are at little risk of dying from the virus, there is still the risk of long-Covid, he says.

Although he acknowledges there is still little hard data to quantify this, some studies have suggested one in 10 suffers long-lasting symptoms from infection.

The big unknown - vaccine and transmission

The factor that could have a significant impact on spread is whether vaccination stops transmission.

The trials showed the vaccines were good at stopping symptoms developing.

But it is not yet known whether those who have been vaccinated will still be able to pass the virus on.

Most people expect there will be some disruption to transmission but how much is not clear - and will not be for months.

Tough judgements will have to be made

But on the other side of all this is the huge impact lockdown has.

The first priority will, of course, be the re-opening of schools.

Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, says everything must be done to make this happen.

He says while schools contributed to spread of the virus, they were not a ""significant driver"", adding schools were closed for the ""benefit of the population"" but at great expense to children.

Once schools are open some tough calls will have to be made - and this is where the debate is going to rage.

Backbench Tory MPs are putting the pressure on the prime minister with the Covid Recovery Group calling for a ""gradually unwrapping"" of society from early March.

In the end, it is going to come down to what society is willing to tolerate.

UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has spoken about ""de-risking"" Covid.

His point is that we will reach a situation at which the level of death and illness caused by Covid is at a level society can ""tolerate"" - just as we tolerate 7,000 to 20,000 people dying from flu every year.

Sociologist Prof Robert Dingwall, who advises the government on the science of human behaviour, believes that point will be reached sooner rather than later.

""I think we will see a pretty rapid lifting of restrictions in the spring and summer."

The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years.

This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website.

This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration.

For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US.

Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed.

""However, with the Democrats’ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soon”.

Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes.

But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans."

President Trump's final day as president fact-checked,"President Trump's final day as president fact-checked By Reality Check team

BBC News Published 20 January

On leaving office as US president, President Trump has made a number of claims about his record.

We've fact-checked some of things he said in a farewell speech at the Andrews Air Base in Maryland and in a video statement released by the White House.

Claim: ""We rebuilt the United States military.""

In his final public speech as president, he hailed his government's track record on the military.

He's previously said it was depleted under former President Obama.

It's true that Mr Trump's administration has increased the amount of military funding.

However, the levels of spending are lower than what was spent on the military during Mr Obama's first administration (2009 to 2013), when using data adjusted for inflation.

President Trump has also scaled back the number of troops in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq.

Claim: ""We have the greatest economy in the world.""

In his remarks at Andrews Air base, Mr Trump also said ""we have the greatest economy in the world"", and prior to the pandemic the numbers were ""at a level nobody had ever seen before"".

The US economy had certainly done well under him prior to the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, but there have been periods under previous administrations when it did better.

In his first three years in office, President Trump oversaw an annual average growth of 2.5%.

This was slightly higher than the final three years of the Obama era.

However, there have been many periods when the growth of GDP - the value of goods and services in the economy - was a lot higher.

And in 2020, the economy saw the largest contraction on record because of the pandemic.

It rebounded by 33% in the third quarter last year, itself a record for a quarterly increase, but this did not bring economic activity back to pre-pandemic levels.

President Trump also said: ""Now the stock market is actually substantially higher than it was at its higher point prior to the pandemic.""

Although there have been recent wobbles, the stock market has bounced back to above pre-pandemic levels.

Claim: ""When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed.""

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use for two Covid-19 vaccines - Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.

The government's vaccine programme, Operation Warp Speed, did provide funding for the development of the Moderna vaccine.

While Pfizer/BioNTech did sign a deal with the government to deliver doses, it didn't receive any money to do development or testing.

And although Pfizer is a US firm, this particular vaccine was developed in conjunction with the German-based BioNTech company.

It was their gene-based technology which was the key to making the vaccine.

Claim: ""I am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars.""

This needs context as it depends on how you define war.

The US has formally enacted declarations of war against 11 countries in five separate conflicts. The last formal declaration of war was during World War II.

Most of the time the US enters conflicts using the ""authorisation of military force"" granted by Congress to the president.

For example, President George W Bush used this for the Iraq war in 2003.

And President Obama sought Congressional approval to intervene in Syria after chemical weapons were used there.

President Trump has engaged in military actions abroad using legislation passed by previous governments.

In October 2019, he announced the killing of Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a military operation, but said he decided not to notify Democrat leaders in Congress beforehand.

In January 2020, President Trump ordered an airstrike which killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. The White House cited Congress's ""authorisation of military force"" granted under the Bush administration as its legal basis.

The Trump administration has also increased US drone strikes in Somalia.

Claim: ""We proudly leave... with the strongest border security measures ever put into place… with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall.""

Building a wall along the southern border with Mexico was one of his major pledges in the run-up to the 2016 election.

As of 4 January 2021, a total of 452 miles (757km) of barrier has been built since he took office.

However, the vast majority of this new wall replaced existing structures on the border.

Only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there was none before.

Of this 47 miles is what's called primary wall, and 33 miles is secondary wall that reinforces the initial barrier.

President-elect Joe Biden said he would not build ""another foot"" of the wall.

Claim: ""We... achieved record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans...""

The African American unemployment rate hit 5.2% in August 2019, and the Hispanic rate hit 4% in September 2019.

These were the lowest rates recorded since the US Labor Department started collecting these statistics in the 1970s.

The unemployment rate has recently spiked significantly for both groups because of the huge impact of the pandemic on the US economy.

And this has disproportionately affected African Americans and Hispanic Americans - their unemployment rates are 3.2 and 2.6 percentage points higher respectively than the overall figure.

Asian American unemployment is currently 5.9%.

It reached a record low of 2.1% in June 2019, but these records only date back to 2003.

Claim: ""We passed VA Choice""

VA Choice is a government programme which offers better quality health care to ex-military members in the US.

President Trump didn't pass this programme - it was created in 2014 under President Obama - but he did expand it."
Netflix: Four things which have driven its success,"The success of Lupin and other titles from the firm, such as Bridgerton, Tiger King and Money Heist, is a sign of the extent to which Netflix - which once relied on movies and shows made by other companies - has become a major force in film-making and television."
"Trump pardons dozens in final hours, including ex-aide Steve Bannon","Prosecutors said Mr Bannon and three others defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, which pledged to use donations to build segments of the barrier and raised $25m (£18m). It was alleged Mr Bannon received more than $1m, at least some of which he used to cover personal expenses. He denied the claims."
Can Biden succeed in economic rescue mission?,"Then he was vice president and the world was reeling from the shock of the financial crisis. And while Mr Biden has defended the economic record of his then-boss President Barack Obama, there are plenty on his team who wish the US had done more."

Australia v India: How social media reacted to tourists' astonishing series win,"Last updated on .From the section Cricket

On 19 December, India cricket experienced one of its darkest days on the field.

The touring side were bowled out for 36 - their lowest total in Test cricket - and lost the first match of the series against Australia in Adelaide.

But exactly a month later, we witnessed the culmination of arguably the greatest series the game has ever seen. And perhaps the greatest comeback.

India came fighting back to win the second Test in Melbourne, dug in to draw in Sydney, and then pulled off an astonishing run-chase to triumph by three wickets in the decider at the Gabba in Brisbane.

Let's look at how the cricketing world reacted.

No Kohli? No problem

The India team were missing many key players, including captain Virat Kohli, who returned home after the first Test to be at the birth of his first child.

Kohli, as expected, was overjoyed at the way his team bounced back…

And it turns out he left the side in capable hands, with stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane leading the fightback…

The remarkable comeback was duly appreciated by the greatest India batsman of all…

While current and former players from across the globe also applauded the feat…

And even a Bollywood star shared her thoughts…

'The depth of Indian cricket is scary'

With a depleted India missing Kohli, several fast bowlers and spin duo Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, it was an opportunity for some of the younger members of the team to make their mark on Test cricket.

Step forward Rishabh Pant, 23, and Shubman Gill, 21.

Needing 328 to win, a record run-chase at Brisbane, Gill made 91 and Pant was unbeaten on 89.

The future looks bright for India…

'I have egg on my face'

After the one-sided nature of the series opener, some pundits and former players, including ex-England captain Michael Vaughan, predicted a 4-0 Australia victory.

This tweet from Ashwin suggests those predictions fuelled the fire for India's resurgence…

Meanwhile, Vaughan became inundated with tweets from the sub-continent...

Although the Test Match Special pundit did admit he got it wrong…

Australian arrogance and pride injured - Sehwag

Away from the on-field action, the series was full of controversy and drama; most notably in the drawn third Test.

There were suggestions Australia batsman Steve Smith deliberately scuffed up the crease to gain an advantage - a claim he disputed - while captain Tim Paine was embroiled in a verbal exchange with India's Ashwin.

Paine could be heard saying: ""I can't wait to get you to the Gabba, Ash.""

Well, Paine's words may well have returned to haunt him, as Australia suffered their first loss at the ground since 1988.

Former India opener Virender Sehwag had his say…

Meanwhile, ex-Australia internationals Shane Warne and Tom Moody pondered where the team go from here…

Despite the fierce nature of the series, there was a nice touch from India, who recognised Australia spinner Nathan Lyon's 100th Test by presenting him a signed jersey…

'England v India is a big series'

There will be little time for India to relax and unwind. They begin a four-Test home series against England, followed by limited-overs games, in Chennai on 5 February.

With Joe Root's men 1-0 up in a two-match series against Sri Lanka, these former England internationals - like most cricket fans - are looking forward to what will be an intriguing match-up…"

media caption The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration

US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil.

Mr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures.

Joe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons.

Security is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony.

Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead.

The FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion.

What was the Trump decree about?

The US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office.

Just minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: ""On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19.""

She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"".

What else might Trump do on his final full day?

Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday.

A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings.""

There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House.

image copyright Reuters image caption Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens

Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power.

The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered.

The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists.

More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon.

Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list.

He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019.

Friends of Joe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger King who is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned.

Then, of course, there is Donald Trump. Could the president pardon himself? It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible.

What of the inauguration ceremony?

The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years.

On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert.

Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid.

image copyright Reuters image caption The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19

The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez.

Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One.

Bloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews.

What is Joe Biden initially planning to do?

On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC.

He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord.

He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing.

Mr Biden will also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report.

The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade.

Covid: Can you catch the virus outside?,"Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease.

Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature.

Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them.

Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses.

Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs.

Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread.

Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown.

Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope.

Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics.

Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working.

Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it.

Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time.

Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms.

Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment.

Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus.

Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only.

NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP.

Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations.

Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously.

Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus.

PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease.

Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread.

R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread.

Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods.

Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003.

Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease.

Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport.

State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services.

Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament.

Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.

Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection.

Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail."

Brexit: End to Gibraltar land border prompts joy and trepidation,"Brexit: End to Gibraltar land border prompts joy and trepidation By Gavin Lee

BBC Europe correspondent, Gibraltar Published 16 January

image caption People in Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU in the Brexit referendum

The Spanish workers of La Línea de la Concepción are at the ready to celebrate the removal of the Gibraltar border controls. And they have reason to.

This small coastal town bordering Gibraltar is one of the poorest in Spain. A third of people here are unemployed and in some neighbourhoods that figure rises to 80%. Drug trafficking from Morocco and armed gangs have become a problem for police.

image caption Gibraltar is an essential source of work for people living in La Línea

Fifteen thousand residents have jobs in Gibraltar where wages are on average 20% higher. And Gibraltar needs them for the lifeblood of its economy, especially in the nursing, catering and cleaning industries.

What will change

As part of the UK's exit from the EU, the UK and Spain have agreed in principle that the land border will go, possibly within six months, but the terms of the deal first have to be made into a formal treaty with the EU:

The single road linking the territories will be widened to allow people and cars to travel freely

Some infrastructure will stay at the border, a few guards will remain on standby, and finalities still need to be worked out such as judging the necessity of certain customs checks away from the border and if so how they would work

For the border to disappear, Gibraltar will effectively become part of Europe's passport-free travel area - the Schengen zone - though there is a different use of language from both sides on whether it will be ""part of"", or ""connected to"" Schengen

With the border gone, new arrivals will only be checked if they enter by sea at the port and by air

For the first time, as well as the Gibraltar border guards, there will be guards from the EU border and Coastguard Agency known as Frontex also checking passports.

media caption Gibraltar's chief minister and Spain's Europe minister tell the BBC why they think the deal is significant

'Work is far more important than the colour of the flag'

Gib, as it's known, has provided work for La Línea resident Melissa for 20 years. She's a teaching assistant and I meet her as she's about to cross the two border posts on her morning commute, first through the Spanish checkpoint, then immediately after at the Gibraltar side where she'll show the guards her work permit.

""This is great news for us. In the future it means it'll be easier to simply cross for people [trying] to get jobs. For my son, for example, who has no job,"" she says. ""Work here for me is far more important than what colour the flag is.""

Juan José Uceda from the La Línea Workers Association celebrated with a 1940s bottle of Rioja when he heard about the deal.

""We think about the change that this can make psychologically to everybody here, and having no borders to impede us. We are a city born because of the needs of Gibraltar, and we have been suffering for so many years, the queues, the delays on the border and the political issues behind it as well.""

Spain, which disputes British sovereignty over the Rock, has often been accused of deliberately holding up traffic by slowing down checks at the frontier to generate long delays, especially at times of tension between the two sides.

""There are workers, who've been waiting at the border many times for five or six hours without moving, and then on the way back again they have to wait the same time,"" Juan José complains.

It affects families on both sides. Especially some of the children who go to school on the other side of the border.

""You could see the children eating their breakfast in the cars, waiting. And there are no toilets here. Nothing.""

'Like St Pancras station on the Eurostar'

Gibraltar's chief minister, Fabien Picardo, describes the agreement as creating ""a common travel area between Gibraltar and the rest of Schengen"".

""This is a little like the juxtaposed controls that you would see at St Pancras station when you're going on the Eurostar. You'd go first through British passport control. And then a few steps later you'd go through the French passport control. That is exactly the set-up of what we propose should happen if the European Commission agree, and we elevate our pre-agreement into a treaty.""

Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha González Laya recently stated that Spain would have to have the ""last say"" on the airport and port border arrangements, because Spain is the Schengen member country allowing the deal to happen.

That's led to criticism that the move could weaken British sovereignty over the territory, but Mr Picardo says that if the plan goes ahead the decision on who enters Gibraltar will only ever be made by a Gibraltarian guard, so the British Overseas Territory would have ""primacy"".

""So if we say 'No' you've got to turn your tail and go. Then, you're not coming in through Gibraltar.

""There is absolutely no way that anybody can suggest the agreement we've done or indeed that we would form part of a treaty that would in any way dilute British sovereignty.""

Spain: 'I would call it 'co-responsibility'

Spain's Europe Minister, Juan González-Barba Pera, told the BBC that while Spanish claims over the Rock hadn't receded, the deal was not about territorial claims.

""In 2002, [Gibraltar] held a referendum and they rejected the idea of co-sovereignty. Instead of co-sovereignty, I would call it 'co-responsibility' because by this agreement the UK is allowing Gibraltar to participate in certain policies of the European Union to which the UK is not participating.""

The Spanish government will outline the details of the agreement in principle in parliament next week.

There has been little chance for Spain's politicians to process the detail of the deal, given that the agreement in principle was rushed through on New Year's Eve, hours before the UK was due to leave the EU.

""There are some people in Spain who are not happy about this agreement because they see it as a lost opportunity to further our claims,"" says the Spanish minister. He also accepts some in the UK and Gibraltar will be unhappy with the deal.

Risks of a return to old tensions

Despite the issues over who has final say over the deal, Gibraltar seems to have a better relationship with Spain's Socialist coalition government than with previous governments in Madrid.

When the conservative Popular party was in power, the foreign minister claimed the Spanish flag would be flying on top of the Rock after Brexit.

For Gibraltarians there are still painful memories of past tensions. As well as border closures, they endured a 13-year blockade enforced by Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 1969.

image caption Gibraltarians are UK citizens and the governor is appointed by the monarch

The EU has been credited with helping to smooth out periodic problems between the territories. Now, with the UK no longer a member, and Spain having increased responsibility at the ports, some locals worry it could be a stepping stone towards Spanish rule.

Retired couple Angela Alessio and Harry Brown, who were born on the Rock, are suspicious of Spanish motives.

""I think when I'm not here any more, in the future, this place will be part of Spain. After all we're in the south of Spain."" Angela says.

Harry disagrees: ""I trust the chief minister, but we have to be careful. One thing will be having European border guards checking passports, but I certainly don't want the Spanish civil guard here doing it on their own.""

""Spain has always wanted to get hold of Gibraltar,"" says ex-British military officer Axle. A site foreman in Gibraltar, he moved to La Línea to live with his Spanish wife.

Gibraltarian, British and Spanish officials all insist the border deal is an experiment that will be re-assessed four years after the border has been removed.

They acknowledge it's not without risks. The hope, though, is that with the border gone, trust between these historically fractious neighbours can begin to grow.

Park Geun-hye: South Korea court upholds 20-year jail term for ex-leader,"Park Geun-hye: South Korea court upholds 20-year jail term for ex-leader Published 14 January

South Korea's top court has upheld a 20-year jail term for former President Park Geun-hye over a vast corruption scandal that led to her downfall.

The ruling on Thursday upheld the reduced term given to Park in July on appeal after she was originally sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Prosecutors had tried to appeal against that reduction.

Park was convicted of abuse of power and coercion after she was impeached in 2017.

The Supreme Court on Thursday also upheld her fine of 18bn won (£12m, $17m).

The former president was her country's first democratically-elected leader to be forced from office in a fallout that also landed two conglomerate heads in prison.

Park, 68, was initially sentenced to a total of 30 years in jail and fined 20bn won, but a high court later reduced the fine and the term to 15 years for corruption with another five for abuse of power.

Thursday's ruling is the final verdict in the case, the culmination of a scandal that had fuelled widespread rage against political and business elites.

What was she convicted of?

In 2018 Park was found guilty of 16 out of 18 charges, most of which related to bribery and coercion.

The court ruled that she had colluded with her close friend, Choi Soon-sil, to pressure conglomerates such as electronics giant Samsung and retail chain Lotte to give millions of dollars to foundations run by Choi.

She was also convicted of forcing companies to sign lucrative deals with firms owned by Choi and donate gifts to Choi and her daughter.

In addition, Park was found guilty of leaking confidential presidential documents to her long-time friend.

The ex-leader has always denied wrongdoing and refused to take part in any of the court proceedings.

What led to her downfall?

Park's close childhood friendship with Choi lay at the heart of her undoing.

The woman swiftly became the leader's most trusted confidante.

But their relationship came under intense public scrutiny and Choi was deemed to have had undue influence over the nation's affairs through her connection with Park.

image copyright Reuters image caption Choi (centre) was a longtime friend and adviser to Park

After a prolonged series of hearings and months of huge street protests calling for her resignation, Park was finally removed from office in March 2017 and arrested shortly afterwards.

image copyright AFP image caption Park's supporters gathered outside the court in Seoul demanding her release in 2018

Who else was caught up in this?

Some of South Korea's biggest companies and their leaders were drawn into the scandal, as well as numerous figures from the entertainment world and government servants.

Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y Lee, was singled out in particular after details emerged that he had given a horse to Choi's daughter Chung Yoo-ra, who is an equestrian.

He was sentenced to jail, but only served five months before he was freed, when an appeals court reduced and suspended his sentence.

Ms Chung has also faced scrutiny, and was extradited from Denmark to South Korea in 2017 to face questioning.

Is this unusual in South Korea?

Park, the daughter of a former military dictator, is not the only ex-president to have been arrested for corruption.

In 2018, former leader Lee Myung-bak was charged with corruption over allegations he took bribes while in office.

Two others, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, were convicted for treason and corruption in the 1990s.

In 2009, former president Roh Moo-hyun killed himself while he was under investigation for corruption.

What next for Park?

The country's first female leader now faces a total of 22 years behind bars - as she was separately sentenced to two years in prison for election law violations.

But the end of the legal process in her graft case also paves the way for a potential pardon as called for by her still vocal supporters.

A top aide to South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said the leader will make a decision on a pardon that reflects the will of the people, reported Reuters news agency.

Yet Park remains a divisive figure.

A survey by the pollster Realmeter last week suggested that 47.7% of people were in favour of a pardon and 48% against.

President Donald Trump has become the first president in history to be impeached twice by the US House of Representatives - and remains one of just three to have been impeached at all.

Here's what happened to the others.

Andrew Johnson

image copyright Print Collector/Getty Images image caption Andrew Johnson was the first US president to face impeachment

What did he do?

In the shadow of the Civil War, President Andrew Johnson - a Democrat - sparred constantly with the Republican-held Congress over how to rebuild the defeated US South.

The ""Radical Republicans"" of this period pushed for legislation to punish former Confederate leaders and protect the rights of freed slaves. Johnson used his presidential veto to block the Republican efforts at every turn.

In March, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, crafted to curtail the president's ability to fire members of his cabinet without approval from the Senate. In defiance, Johnson suspended a cabinet member and political rival, Edwin Stanton, while Congress was in recess.

If today's proceedings seem like a lot of political theatrics, it is in keeping with impeachment tradition: Stanton responded to his firing by locking himself in his office and refusing to leave.

Stanton's removal proved to be the final straw - the House Republicans rushed to draft 11 articles of impeachment.

image copyright Library of Congress image caption A wood engraving shows the Senate trial of Andrew Johnson

After a vote along party lines the articles were presented to the Senate, where he was acquitted, but only just. It was a single vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict.

What were the consequences?

According to some accounts, Johnson wept at the news of his acquittal, vowing to devote himself to restoring his reputation.

It didn't work.

He served out the rest of his presidential term, but his final months in office were beset with the same power struggles that warped his tenure prior to impeachment.

And in 1869, Democrats lost the White House to Republican candidate General Ulysses S Grant, who allowed his party's plan for Radical Reconstruction to continue.

What is his legacy?

Being impeached.

And buying Alaska in 1867 for a cool $7.2m.

Johnson was also one of the poorest presidents. He never went to school.

Richard Nixon

What did he do?

The near-impeachment of Richard Nixon traces back to the 1972 break-in of the Democratic party's headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington DC.

As investigations revealed that the burglars had been paid with funds from Nixon's re-election campaign, the Watergate scandal spread far beyond the break-in, implicating top White House officials.

For nearly two years, Nixon scrambled to cover up his role in the conspiracy, leading to his eventual demise.

The Republican president's efforts proved futile. In August 1974, as the House Judiciary Committee prepared impeachment articles, Nixon was forced to release Oval Office recordings in which the president is heard ordering his staff to have the CIA tell the FBI to stop its investigation into the Watergate break-in.

This now-infamous ""smoking gun"" tape marked the final breakdown of Nixon's attempted cover-up.

On 27 July, the House Judiciary Committee voted to pass three articles of impeachment - obstruction of justice, misuse of power and contempt of Congress - and sent them to the House for a full vote.

But, the vote never occurred.

On 8 August, 1974, Nixon announced his resignation. He remains the only US president in history to have done so.

image copyright Bettmann/Getty Images image caption Nixon says goodbye to his staff after announcing his resignation

""I have never been a quitter,"" he said in his resignation speech. ""To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interest of America first.""

What were the consequences?

Vice-President Gerald Ford was sworn in as president and pardoned Nixon for any crimes he had committed while in office.

Up for election less than two years later, Ford lost the White House to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

What's his legacy?

No contest. It's the Watergate scandal. Though he never admitted to any criminal wrongdoing, his actions remain a cautionary tale of abuse of presidential power.

Nixon died in April 1994, 20 years after he resigned in disgrace.

Speaking at his funeral, then-President Bill Clinton focused on Nixon's work in foreign affairs.

""Let us say: may the day of judging President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career come to a close,"" Mr Clinton said.

Bill Clinton

What did he do?

Just a few years after President Bill Clinton preached forgiveness for Nixon's failings, the Arkansas Democrat was facing his own political crisis.

Within one year of taking office, Mr Clinton found himself under investigation by a Justice Department special prosecutor.

Under special counsel Kenneth Starr, the scope of the probe into real estate dealings expanded in January 1998 to include the president's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

As part of a separate lawsuit against the president - the sexual harassment of Paula Jones - Mr Clinton was asked about his relationship to Ms Lewinsky. Under oath on 17 January, Mr Clinton denied having a relationship with the former White House aide.

Days later, Mr Clinton famously doubled down on his denial.

""I want you to listen to me,"" President Clinton said to media at a White House appearance. ""I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky. I never told a single person to lie, not a single time, never.""

On 9 September 1998, Mr Starr released his report to Congress. The public, too, soon got to see the 445-page Starr report which included salacious testimony from Ms Lewinsky, who had struck an immunity deal with the independent counsel in exchange for her co-operation.

image copyright New York Times

The report also included 11 possible grounds for impeachment. In December 1998, the House of Representatives voted along party lines to impeach Mr Clinton on two counts: perjury and obstruction of Congress.

In February, Mr Clinton was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate.

What were the consequences?

For the year that the Lewinsky-Clinton scandal consumed the country, the president resisted growing calls to resign.

It was during this period, at the end of January 1998, that Mr Clinton laid claim to one of his highest-ever opinion poll ratings. In a poll for CNN, Gallup found that 67% of Americans approved of the president.

In the end, the only politicians to lose their jobs during the impeachment crisis were Republicans.

The Republican plan to ride the scandal to victory in the 1998 midterms backfired: Democrats made gains in both the House and the Senate.

Mr Clinton left office in January 2001 with a 65% approval rating - the highest of any of his predecessors in half a century.

But his party lost the White House when George W Bush beat Al Gore after a recount in Florida.

What is his legacy?

Depends who you ask but the Monica Lewinsky scandal would be up there for most people as the first thing they think of. The impeachment that followed? Less so."

Capitol riots: Did Trump's words at rally incite violence?,"Capitol riots: Did Trump's words at rally incite violence? Published 1 hour ago

Donald Trump is facing an impeachment trial on allegations he incited a mob to storm the US Capitol. So what did the president say prior to the violence?

On 6 January, thousands of Trump supporters gathered at a ""Save America"" rally organised to challenge the result of last November's presidential election.

They listened as Mr Trump spoke to them on the National Mall, near the White House in Washington DC.

In a 70-minute address, Mr Trump exhorted them to march on Congress where politicians had met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's win. The attack began moments after he took the applause.

Those words have now played a central part in his second impeachment, which lawmakers voted in favour of last month.

So what did he say? Here are five key quotes, followed by some legal analysis from Professor Garrett Epps of the University of Baltimore.

'We won this election, and we won it by a landslide'

This was three minutes into his speech. It was a false assertion that Democrats used as the starting point for the incitement charge - not just because he said it on this day but for weeks before.

This quote appears in the article of impeachment, the charge that was backed by the House of Representatives, lower chamber of Congress.

In the months preceding the Joint Session, President Trump repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials. Shortly before the Joint Session commenced, President Trump, addressed a crowd at the Ellipse in Washington, DC. There, he reiterated false claims that ""we won this election, and we won it by a landslide"".

The article has been sent to the Senate, where Mr Trump's trial will begin on Tuesday.

'We will stop the steal'

Here Trump was echoing the slogan of the movement to fight Mr Biden's election victory, which was started a day after the result was declared.

It soon gathered pace on social media and led to rallies across the US. The largest one yet was the one Mr Trump addressed on 6 January.

'We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen'

This was Mr Trump saying in the clearest terms yet that he will never accept Mr Biden's win.

Referring to himself and his supporters collectively, Mr Trump said there would be no concession.

He went on: ""You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.""

media caption ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters

At one point, Mr Trump said the Biden presidency had to be challenged.

""You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can't let that happen.""

'If you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore'

This is the longest quote from Mr Trump's speech that appears in the article of impeachment. It could also be the one that his lawyers will find hardest to defend in the trial.

He also wilfully made statements that, in context, encouraged - and foreseeably resulted in - lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ""if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore"".

However, Mr Trump's lawyers have argued his use of the word ""fight"" was figurative, which has long been accepted in public discourse.

'Peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard'

This was the part of Mr Trump's speech that his defenders have seized on to show that he never incited the crowd.

He said: ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""

The language was very different from other sections, which borrowed more from combat or war.

Indeed, Mr Trump's lawyers have suggested they will highlight his use of the word ""peacefully"" in the trial.

'We are going to the Capitol'

The president used ""we"" but he didn't join them as his supporters took the short walk from the rally to Congress.

He said: ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.""

Analysis by Professor Epps

What is incitement under the law?

Incitement is not a crime under the First Amendment unless it meets certain criteria.

First of all, it has to be intended to cause violence (and you infer that intent from the circumstances). It also has to be likely to cause violence.

If I go downtown and I say to two drunks standing in front of a bank, ""let's rob this bank right now"", I haven't really incited anybody, because it's not very likely they'll rob the bank.

If I say let's meet here tomorrow and rip things up, I'm not inciting because - in the words of the Supreme Court - where there is time for better counsels to prevail, the remedy for speech is more speech.

The speech has to be likely to cause - and this is very important - imminent violent action.

If this was a court of law, does Trump cross the line?

It's quite rare that somebody can be convicted of incitement. In applying that to the president's speech at the rally, it's an agonisingly close case.

It's pretty goddamn imminent because he's telling people to march to the Capitol and I will march with you. There wouldn't be any time for better counsels to prevail because you're just going to leave the Ellipse and walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.

He said we have to fight and show strength, but he also said we're very peacefully and patriotically going to ask, so he's covering himself. In the end, I think it's a jury question.

I'm not sure he's entitled to a dismissal of charges as a matter of law. There's some discussion that government leaders have more leeway, but I don't know how that would play out.

He clearly knew there were people in that crowd who were ready to and intended to be violent, and he certainly did nothing to discourage that. He not only did nothing to discourage it, he strongly hinted it should happen."

Former US President Donald Trump is being put on trial by lawmakers for allegedly inciting a riot at the US Capitol.

Last month Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be charged with misconduct - or impeached - twice by the lower chamber of Congress.

Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to pass an article of impeachment that accused Mr Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"".

The article alleged that Mr Trump made false allegations of election fraud and encouraged his supporters to storm Congress on 6 January.

Now a trial is being held in the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate, which will decide whether to convict or clear Mr Trump of the charge.

This is an unprecedented moment for the US, which has never put an impeached president on trial after they have left office.

So, what can we expect?

How does the trial work?

The trial in the Senate is political, rather than criminal.

A vote will be held at the end of the trial to determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of the charge.

A two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate must back a guilty verdict to convict Mr Trump.

If Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again.

media caption House delivers impeachment charge against Donald Trump to the Senate

What happens when?

The trial will open on Tuesday with a four-hour debate on whether the proceedings are unconstitutional because Trump is no longer president. A vote will then be held on the issue.

From Wednesday at noon, each side will be given 16 hours to make their arguments.

There will be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called.

The Senate plans to pause the trial from Friday evening to Saturday evening for the Jewish Sabbath.

It is not clear how long the proceedings will last, but Democrats are seeking a speedy trial.

That's because they are keen to turn their attention to the legislative agenda of Democratic President Joe Biden, who is seeking to urgently pass a Covid-19 relief plan.

What is the prosecution's case?

Mr Trump is ""personally responsible"" for the riot and must be convicted, Democrats say.

In a pre-trial legal brief, they said his repeated refusal to concede the election led to an ""incitement of insurrection against the republic he swore to protect"".

Mr Trump's ""statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow"", they argued.

They will use his words and footage from the riot to show that ""the furious crowd"" was ""primed (and prepared) for violence if he lit a spark"".

""The evidence is clear,"" they wrote. ""When other attempts to overturn the presidential election failed, former President Trump incited an attack on the Capitol.""

Although he is no longer in office, Mr Trump ""must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last"", Democrats argued.

They have called for Mr Trump to be disqualified from ever running for office again.

What is Trump's defence?

In their own pre-trial brief, Mr Trump's lawyers rejected the impeachment charge against him, arguing his supporters stormed Congress of their own accord.

Mr Trump's pre-riot remarks, his lawyers argued, did not amount to incitement.

The former president's call to ""fight"" was not meant to be taken literally, the lawyers said.

""To characterise this statement alone as 'incitement to insurrection' is to ignore, wholesale, the remainder of Mr Trump's speech that day, including his call for his supporters to 'peacefully' making their 'voices heard,'"" they said.

Moreover, FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance, the lawyers said.

In another line of argument, Mr Trump's team rejected the case against him as unconstitutional.

They argued that, because Mr Trump is now a private citizen, he can no longer be deposed as president.

The lawyers described the trial as ""political theatre"" and a ""brazen political act"" intended to ""silence a political opponent and a minority party"".

Can he be tried now he has left?

It's never happened before, so it's untested and the US Constitution doesn't say.

Impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon were ended when he quit in 1974.

So Mr Trump could take his case to the Supreme Court, claiming his trial was unconstitutional.

Some lower ranked officials have been impeached after leaving office.

Will Trump give evidence?

That's certainly what prosecutors wanted. Last week, they sent a letter inviting him to testify under oath ""at a mutually convenient time and place"".

The prosecution team suggested that they would cite Mr Trump's silence as further proof that their allegations were true.

Within hours, however, the former president's lawyers had rejected the request as a publicity stunt.

They made clear he would not testify voluntarily. The prosecutors do have the power to subpoena his testimony, but that is considered unlikely.

Who will be involved in the trial?

Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Mr Trump, but will not do so again.

Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy - third in the line of presidential succession - will preside over the trial instead.

Prosecuting the case will be nine House Democrats, known as the impeachment managers.

Mr Trump will be represented by two attorneys - Bruce Castor and David Schoen.

It remains unclear if he will add more people to his legal team.

All 100 US senators have been sworn in as jurors in the trial.

Could Trump be convicted in the Senate?

Democrats only hold half the 100 seats so they would require 17 Republicans to vote against someone from their own party.

That's a high bar for a party that has largely remained publicly loyal to Mr Trump.

But 10 Republicans in the House supported impeachment and a handful of senators have indicated they are open to it.

Last week, however, 45 out of 50 Senate Republicans voted in favour of a bid to dismiss the trial.

Could Trump run for president again if convicted?

If he is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers must hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024.

This could be the biggest consequence of this impeachment.

If he is convicted, a simple majority of senators would be needed to block Mr Trump from holding ""any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States"".

So 50 senators plus a casting vote from Vice-President Kamala Harris would be enough to damn Mr Trump's hopes of political power.

This could be appealing to Republicans hoping to run for president in the future and those who want Mr Trump out of the party.

What about other benefits?

There has been talk of Mr Trump losing benefits granted to his predecessors under the 1958 Former Presidents Act, which include a pension and health insurance, and potentially a lifetime security detail at taxpayers' expense.

However, Mr Trump is likely to keep these benefits if he is convicted after leaving office.

Congress has already approved $4 trillion in Covid relief. Here's what's happened to it,"Washington (CNN) Congress has authorized nearly $4 trillion in spending over the past year to help address the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic , but only about $3 trillion of it has been spent.

Roughly a third of that money went directly to struggling families through stimulus checks , expanded unemployment payments and food stamps. That leaves about $1 trillion that hasn't been disbursed yet, even as President Joe Biden is calling on Congress to approve another $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.

Administration officials say the risk of doing too little is far greater than the risk of going too big, while many Republican lawmakers -- and at least one well-known Democratic economist, Larry Summers -- are concerned about the price tag of Biden's plan. A group of 10 GOP senators have proposed a $618 billion package, which would narrow the number of people eligible for stimulus payments and provide less school funding than the Biden plan.

Much of the $1 trillion previously authorized but as-yet unspent funds are scheduled to be used over time, and only a small portion will never be spent, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group tracking the spending.

Here's what hasn't yet gone out the door:

About $500 billion left from March 2020

Congress passed three major stimulus packages last March and April. At $2.7 trillion, the CARES Act was the largest and put in place some of the key benefit relief programs that Biden is working to extend, joined by lawmakers from both parties.

About 80% of the money from these prior bills has been disbursed. About half of what's left is related to ongoing Medicaid spending and some long-term small business loans, known as Economic Injury Disaster Loans. The Medicaid matching payments to states will continue as long as there is a public health emergency. The disaster loans remain available to small businesses. Though they carry low interest, they weren't as popular as the Paycheck Protection Program loans, which are forgiven if used on qualifying expenses.

It's possible that some of the relief programs, like the the 13-week extension of unemployment benefits in the CARES Act, may end up costing less than expected, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

School funds disbursed but not spent

The amount of money the federal government should give to school districts to help them reopen buildings safely has emerged as one of the big differences between the Biden and Republican proposals for additional stimulus spending.

The White House is calling for $130 billion while the plan from 10 Republican senators proposed $20 billion, citing concerns that a big chunk of the money authorized in earlier packages remains unspent.

While the $68 billion authorized in December has been disbursed by the federal government, just $4.4 billion of that pot had been actually spent by school districts as of last month. Administration officials say that money will likely be spent in the coming weeks and argue that the funding in Biden's plan would help avoid layoffs into the next school year, as well as help with reopening.

Half of the money left was in the most recent stimulus

in late December, when lawmakers passed a Roughly half of the unspent money comes from the package approved by Congressin late December, when lawmakers passed a $915 billion relief bill that provided $600 stimulus payments, extended unemployment benefits, reopened the small business loan program and various other spending.

Some of this money is intended to last for months. For example, there's about $120 billion left for boosted federal unemployment benefits, which are set to expire by the end of March, and a 15% increase to SNAP benefits that will last for six months.

More than $200 billion remains for the Paycheck Protection Program , which recently reopened to small businesses for a second round of loans and is available through March. The money is going out quickly. More than 891,000 loan applications totaling $72 billion were approved by the Small Business Administration in the first few weeks."
"Roberts won't preside over impeachment trial, but Leahy set to follow his 2020 script","(CNN) Sen. Patrick Leahy is expected to adhere largely to the script of Chief Justice John Roberts when he presides over the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump this week.

But unlike when the robe-clad Roberts oversaw then-President Trump's 2020 trial, Leahy will routinely slip into his senator role for votes, including on whether to convict or acquit the former president of inciting the deadly January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.

The 80-year-old Vermont Democrat -- who is the chamber's president pro tempore, or the longest serving senator of the majority party -- could also end up voting on knotty motions related to evidence and witnesses.

Roberts declined to vote in last year's trial related to Trump's Ukrainian dealings, and when specifically asked if he would break a tie, the inscrutable chief justice said, ""It would be inappropriate for me, an elected official from a different branch of government"" to steer the outcome.

""That isn't an issue for Leahy,"" observed Michael Davidson, a former Senate legal counsel. ""He is part of the body that is conducting the trial. ... His state will still have his representation in the Senate.""

Just as the first-ever impeachment trial of a former president will break new ground in America, so will the dual roles of Leahy. He will have a model in the actions of two chief justices of the United States, Roberts with Trump in 2020 and William Rehnquist with President Bill Clinton in 1999.

Sources familiar with Leahy's preparation say he is reviewing how the two men presided and is looking to patterns set by the chief justices in an effort to enforce Senate trial procedures, maintain a sense of decorum and avoid driving the arguments of either side.

Leahy can also look to the pattern of senators who presided at trials of impeached US judges in recent decades, including the 2010 trial of Louisiana-based US District Judge Thomas Porteous , overseen by the late Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii.

Leahy will necessarily break, however, from the mainly ministerial position assumed by Roberts and Rehnquist.

Whether any of Leahy's votes are cast on close fractious motions will depend on how the trial scheduled to begin Tuesday unfolds and the dueling strategies of the US House impeachment managers and Trump legal team.

Leahy already voted once after being sworn on January 26 as presiding officer, with the 55-45 majority that rejected a move by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul to block the trial from going forward. That vote could be a preview of the ultimate result, an insufficient number of Republicans voting with Democrats and a Trump acquittal: The Senate trial process for a president resembles that for judges and other officials impeached by the US House. In all cases, the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote for conviction.

Leahy, who has vowed to be fair and impartial, is declining interviews, according to a spokesman.

How Roberts and Rehnquist ran trials

Roberts and Rehnquist tried to ensure an orderly proceeding and adopt a secondary role for themselves. They kept the clock and enforced rules that the Senate leadership had devised. They conferred with the Senate parliamentarian (currently Elizabeth MacDonough) and worked from carefully outlined scripts.

Roberts intervened last year to admonish a testy exchange between House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and White House counsel Pat Cipollone. Roberts quoted from the impeachment trial of Judge Charles Swayne of Florida.

""In the 1905 Swayne trial, a senator objected when one of the managers used the word ' pettifogging ,' and the presiding officer said the word ought not have been used,"" Roberts said in the after-midnight episode. ""I don't think we need to aspire of that high a standard, but I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are.""

When then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put Roberts on the spot about voting to break a tie, the chief justice said, ""If the members of this body elected by the people and accountable to them divide equally on a motion, the normal rule is that the motion fails."" Roberts refused to ""assert the power to change"" a result.

In 1999, Rehnquist never faced such a question and when the trial ended enjoyed taking a page from Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera "" Iolanthe "" to say, ""I did nothing in particular, and did it very well.""

Roberts, when he was finished last year, expressed his gratitude to senators for assisting him in his ""ill-defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting.""

The Constitution says only that, ""When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.""

Leahy had previously said Roberts was ""the first choice"" for this second trial of Trump, although he is no longer a sitting president. Schumer, now Senate majority leader, said in an interview on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" that ""it was up to John Roberts whether he wanted to preside with a president who's no longer sitting ... And he doesn't want to do it.""

Roberts has declined requests to comment on the matter.

Leahy's plans

Leahy will naturally forgo the black robe, but he will adopt some of the trappings of a special presiding officer. He is expected to work out of the glittery, chandeliered President's Room near the Senate chamber, as the two chief justices did. And as they did, sources familiar with the senator's preparation say Leahy will take his lead on the procedural details from Senate leaders, including when to begin and end daily.

Senate rules, not judicial practice, generally cover impeachment trials, which are inherently political affairs. The Supreme Court in a 1993 case said the Senate has the sole responsibility for trying an official who has been impeached. In 1999, Rehnquist described the Senate as sitting essentially as a court, not simply as a panel of jurors.

Although the Senate's current rules were outlined principally in 1986, they originated with the 1868 trial of President Andrew Johnson . Johnson, Clinton and Trump (twice) are the only US presidents ever to be impeached. In those prior trials, none was convicted.

Because conviction requires a two-thirds vote, Leahy's position as Democratic senator is unlikely to be determinative. But other procedural matters could pose complicated dilemmas.

Senate rules say the presiding officer may rule on all questions of evidence, but that if a senator objects, the officer can be reversed by a majority vote of the Senate.

Leahy may sidestep ruling on a controversial issue that would predictably prompt an objection, and instead put the matter directly to the full Senate, which is currently divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats.

Trump denies that he incited the mob that descended on the Capitol, and his lawyers argue that the Senate has no authority to try him. They say once he left office on January 20, he can no longer be subject to a Senate impeachment trial.

And they hold up the absence of Roberts as one piece of evidence for the overall unconstitutionality of the trial, asserting, ""(T)he constitutional mandate for the Chief Justice to preside at all impeachments involving the President evidently disappeared.""

On the broad issue of the constitutionality of trying Trump, the House managers insist, ""There is no 'January Exception' to impeachment or any other provision of the Constitution. A president must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last."""
Tribal health providers have figured out the key to Covid-19 vaccine success. Here's their secret,"(CNN) Native people have been disproportionately hit by Covid-19, experiencing higher rates of infection, hospitalization and death than White people in the US. But when it comes to vaccine administration, tribal health providers are often outpacing counties and states.

For the most part, the Covid-19 vaccine rollout in the US so far has been beset by long lines, glitchy websites and canceled appointments. Meanwhile, many tribal nations and health clinics have moved efficiently through their vaccine allotments and distribution phases -- with some already offering shots to Native people as young as 16.

""We have some real crushing challenges in Indian Country,"" said Stacy Bohlen, chief executive officer of the National Indian Health Board. ""We have a perfect storm for a pandemic like this to really knock us down. But we are also very, very resilient people.""

It's important to note that there are 574 federally recognized tribes, making it difficult to broadly characterize how the vaccine rollout is going across Indian Country. Native people get their health care from a patchwork system of Indian Health Service facilities, tribally-operated clinics and urban Indian health centers, and vaccination efforts have varied from tribe to tribe and state to state.

Still, the successes of some tribal health providers offer lessons for communities struggling to vaccinate their populations efficiently. Here are some of them.

They tailored their messaging to build trust

From the beginning, vaccine hesitancy was a public health challenge for tribal health providers, especially given the federal government's history of unethical research and medical abuses committed against Native people.

A recent survey of 1,435 American Indians and Alaska Natives from the Urban Indian Health Institute found that 75% of participants were willing to get a Covid-19 vaccine, largely out of a sense of responsibility to protect their communities and preserve their cultures. That suggests that culturally relevant messaging is key to building vaccine acceptance among Native people, the report's authors wrote.

It's a strategy that the Cherokee Nation says has worked for them.

The Cherokee Nation has administered more than 17,000 vaccines as of February 8, according to the tribe. About 141,000 Cherokee Nation citizens live within the bounds of the tribe's reservation in northeastern Oklahoma, suggesting an impressive pace so far.

The tribe's ""biggest confidence builder"" in the vaccine has been its decision to put fluent Cherokee speakers at the front of the line, said Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr.

Cherokee speakers were among the first groups eligible for the vaccine, as part of the tribe's effort to save its language from the existential threat of Covid-19. Only about 2,000 people could speak Cherokee fluently before the pandemic. The virus claimed the lives of an estimated 45 speakers.

By inoculating its most revered and treasured citizens first, the Cherokee Nation signaled to others who may have been on the fence that it believed the vaccine was safe.

""That's done something to create a sense of optimism among our people and also to boost the confidence of other Cherokees who see these very revered Cherokee elders, in many cases who are fluent speakers, getting the vaccines and celebrating it,"" he told CNN.

People wait in line at a senior care center on the Navajo Nation in Chinle, Arizona, to receive the Covid-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020.

Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said that people were hesitant to get the vaccine early on, so he got the shot on camera to help build confidence in it. The tribe has also been answering questions Navajo people have over the radio and in twice weekly town halls, sometimes bringing in experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Also key to the tribe's confidence-building efforts are Navajo doctors and health care professionals, who are able to speak to citizens in their own language and alleviate any concerns about its safety.

""Utilizing our way of life and teaching helps our Navajo people feel it's okay to take the shots,"" Nez said.

About three out of four Navajo citizens are now interested in getting the vaccine, according to Nez. To accommodate that interest, the tribe has been holding mass vaccination events seven days a week.

They have the autonomy to decide who gets priority

Tribes are sovereign nations with the autonomy to determine how to provide for the health care needs of their communities. For those that operate their own health systems, that meant being able to decide who should get priority for the vaccine.

That autonomy allows tribes to adequately respond to the unique challenges they face, said Bohlen.

For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that initial phases of the vaccine distribution include people 75 and older because they are at higher risk of severe illness and death for Covid-19. But certain tribes might decide to expand those parameters because of the health disparities their populations experience.

""Our life expectancy is so much lower than the general population that we have to be able to make the decision that maybe a 55-year-old is in fact an elder, if you're in a tribe where the life expectancy is 58,"" Bohlen said.

Colleen DAmico, a clinical pharmacist with the Seattle Indian Health Board, administers a Covid-19 vaccine to nurse Shawn Thurman on December 21, 2020.

In Washington state, that self-determination also extends to urban Indian health centers.

The Seattle Indian Health Board, a community health center that specializes in the care of American Indians and Alaska Natives, opened vaccinations to American Indians and Alaska Natives 55 and older early on in their distribution plan. That ensured that they could protect all of the elders served by their elders program, many of who are homeless, said CEO Esther Lucero.

""That's sometimes the only place they get a warm meal or get social interaction or not have to be out in really terrible weather,"" she said, referring to the location where elders in the program congregate. ""So that was really important to us.""

As of February 1, the organization has opened appointments to all people 50 and older, Native or not.

This health system is owned by its people

Having successfully inoculated some of their most vulnerable populations, some tribal health providers are now opening up appointments even to younger, relatively healthy Native people -- groups that would otherwise likely be months away from getting a vaccine.

Southcentral Foundation, a regional health organization owned and operated by the local Native community in southern central Alaska, offered its first vaccines to frontline healthcare workers and Native people 85 and older. Once the organization acquired the necessary staffing to operate larger vaccination clinics, it quickly scaled up its distribution to offer the shot to successively younger age groups, said interim president and CEO April Kyle.

It has been vaccinating Native people 16 and older since January 22.

Southcentral Foundation has administered more than 12,000 vaccine doses as of February 8, according to the health care system. The organization serves about 65,000 Alaska Native and American Indian people in Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and surrounding rural villages.

Southcentral Foundation's success is a credit to its community-owned health care model, Kyle said.

Kyle attributes the organization's smooth vaccine rollout so far to the Native people in southern central Alaska, who developed a community-focused health care system that in turn was able to plan for how to get vaccines even to people in challenging terrains.

She's seeing similar results in tribal health systems across the country.

""I'm watching the news, and I'm really impressed with the passion and sophistication of tribal health care and the ways that communities are able to know how in their community to get that vaccine out,"" she said.

They made big investments in health care

Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Hoskin has some advice for how the US can replicate the tribe's success. But it's not a quick fix.

""We're a country that doesn't make access to health care just part of being a citizen,"" he said. ""Because of that, there's uneven access to health care across the country. That's a problem during good times, and it's certainly a problem during the pandemic.""

Meanwhile, the Cherokee Nation has spent the past decade shoring up its health care system, which is now the largest tribally-operated health system in the US, Hoskin said.

A Cherokee Nation citizen receives a Covid-19 vaccine on January 12, 2021.

That robust infrastructure allowed the tribe to set up a call center early on to reach eligible citizens efficiently -- a step that many states are only now taking. Contacting residents via robocalls also helped the tribal government avoid the long lines and confusing online signup forms that have plagued residents in so many counties and states.

""I hope the lesson people can learn from Cherokee Nation's success is that you've got to invest in health care during the good times, make it a priority for your nation and make it universally accessible for your citizens,"" Hoskin said.

Ultimately, success depends on the nation's vaccine supply

The tribal health providers interviewed by CNN say they're getting shots out the door and into arms soon after they receive shipments, which come either from the Indian Health Service or their state governments.

But whether they can keep up their steady vaccination rates ultimately depends on whether the US can continue to provide vaccines at the speed and volume at which they need -- a challenge that has already slowed down efforts for counties and states.

There's reason for optimism: President Joe Biden's administration recently rolled out a series of measures aimed at ramping up vaccination efforts, which include purchasing 200 million more vaccine doses and increasing distribution to states by millions of doses.

If that turns out to be the case, tribal health providers say they'll be ready.

""Can the United States keep up with the Cherokee Nation?"" Hoskin asked. ""That's really the key question for us.""



CORRECTION: This piece has been corrected to say that the virus claimed the lives of an estimated 45 Cherokee speakers."
"Biden and Democrats prepare to act fast on judges, having learned lesson from Trump","(CNN) President Joe Biden had been in office less than a week when a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction blocking one of his first immigration-related actions.

The order was a victory for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who crowed ""WE WON"" on Twitter. In fact, Paxton, a controversial conservative Republican, had successfully gambled that his challenge would land before a judge appointed by President Donald Trump. And indeed Judge Drew B. Tipton -- appointed by Trump in 2020 -- delivered

The order is a potent reminder of the power of the judiciary to cripple a president's forward momentum on an issue. It also highlighted the fact that elections matter -- giving an incoming president the chance to create a lasting legacy. Trump, for example, was able to appoint 234 judges, including three Supreme Court justices.

Now it's Biden's turn, and so far his administration is signaling that judicial nominations will be a major priority and that Democrats may even tear pages from Trump's playbook on the issue.

There are 60 current eligible vacancies and 20 vacancies that will occur down the road as judges have formally announced their intentions to retire, take senior status or resign, according to the Administrative Office of the US Courts.

One other factor could be a game changer for Biden: the lingering possibility that 82-year-old Justice Stephen Breyer might choose to step aside this term or next and give Biden his first chance to name a Supreme Court justice.

Biden has vowed to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, and even before his inauguration his transition team sent a letter to Democratic senators seeking recommendations for district court vacancies that might arise.

There is also an effort afoot to speed up the confirmation process by no longer allowing the American Bar Association to vet judicial candidates before they are nominated.

Some progressives, however, have legitimate concerns regarding whether the White House and the Senate will maintain the discipline and stamina necessary over the coming weeks and months to keep judges a priority as attention shifts to other areas.

They still remember that President Barack Obama came up short when faced with a similar opportunity early in his presidency, and they believe he squandered an opportunity to focus on the courts.

Chris Kang, chief counsel for the progressive group Demand Justice, believes things will be different now.

""President Biden's approach to judicial nominations is going to put the nail in the coffin of the conventional wisdom that Democrats don't care enough about the court,"" he said in an interview.

Pending vacancies

As things stand, since Biden's inauguration, judges sitting on powerful courts have already announced plans to go into senior status, giving the new President the chance to replace them with younger nominees.

Since Biden's inauguration there have been five announced vacancies on the appeals courts as well as a handful on district courts, and more are expected

Judge Robert A. Katzmann, for example, who penned an opinion that would have allowed Trump's tax records to go to a New York prosecutor, has announced plans to take senior status on the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals.

Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, who sits the US District Court in Washington and most recently oversaw the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn , will also take senior status.

Another notable vacancy will come up once Judge Merrick Garland of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is confirmed as Biden's attorney general. Democrats haven't forgotten that Garland, nominated by Obama early in 2016 to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, was denied a hearing by Senate Republicans, who simply sat on the nomination until the presidential election was over.

The DC Circuit is considered a breeding ground for Supreme Court nominees and served as a steppingstone for Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as Justices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Scalia and Brett Kavanaugh.

High on the list of potential contenders is Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who sits on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. She is a former Breyer clerk who also served as a public defender. California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger is a potential nominee for Breyer's seat if he were to step down.

In addition, in the coming weeks, Biden is set to reveal the membership for a bipartisan commission that will take a look at revisions to the Supreme Court, including the potential of term limits and adding more seats to the bench.

How Trump and Senate Republicans transformed the courts

Under Trump, a careful troika composed of White House Counsel Don McGahn, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley worked immediately and almost seamlessly to change the face of the courts.

Democrats were livid and accused the Republicans at times of ignoring the rules in order to bulldoze the process, but with Republicans in the Senate majority all four years of the Trump presidency, the Democrats were unable to stop all but a handful of nominations.

The Republicans ran a closely held vetting operation, eased long-standing institutional norms and, perhaps most importantly, maintained forward momentum, avoiding distraction, as other issues blew up around the presidency.

The process -- no easy feat straddling three branches -- required discipline and outside backing. Under Trump, the conservative Federalist Society and later a group called The Article III Project were supportive of Trump's nominees.

""President Trump's biggest and most consequential accomplishment was his transformation of the federal judiciary, including his solidification of a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and his appointment of a near-record 54 circuit judges to the critically important federal courts of appeals,"" said Mike Davis, president of the Article III Project. ""These lifetime appointments will provide an important constitutional check on government overreach by the Biden administration.""

In the early Obama years, outside groups often disagreed on potential nominees and the political branches lacked a laser-like focus necessary to accompany a nominee to confirmation.

During the lead-up to the 2016 election, Trump made the Supreme Court and lower courts a campaign issue. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton rarely brought it up and some liberals squabbled over whether Garland should remain the Democratic pick.

After Trump won, Democrats found themselves helpless as they fought the onslaught of nomination hearings. They were largely sidelined as Justice Neil Gorsuch got the seat once offered to Garland, Kavanaugh won confirmation after perhaps the most ferocious nomination fight in history and conservatives rushed to fill the seat of the liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg with the conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Ginsburg died some four months short of Biden's inauguration.

The Supreme Court now has a solid 6-3 conservative majority that could last for decades as issues such as abortion, immigration, affirmative action, religious liberty, voting rights and the Second Amendment reach the high court.

A final wake-up call for progressives came at the end of Barrett's confirmation hearing in October, when Democrats, still furious that Republicans had rushed deadlines in the run-up to the election, witnessed Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, hug Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and praise him for his efforts during the hearings.

Then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he had had a ""long and serious"" talk with Feinstein. Progressives felt betrayed, and it wasn't long after that Feinstein announced she would step down as top Democrat on the committee.

The Democratic team

Now that Biden is in office, there's a new troika in town. White House Counsel Dana Remus, Schumer -- now the majority leader -- and Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, are in place.

Brian Fallon, who runs Demand Justice, launched in 2018, is determined to keep the pressure on from outside of government. His group wants Biden's team to move away from recent models and nominate a diverse group of individuals including public defenders, civil rights lawyers and legal aid attorneys.

On Friday, Fallon tweeted a stern reminder about the lessons learned from 2009 just after Obama took over. ""Don't listen to Rahm on how much to prioritize judges,"" he wrote. It was a not-so-subtle reminder that Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, hadn't seen the judiciary as a priority.

The three lessons from 2009 are:

1. Dont spend months chasing Republican votes that will never come

2. Dont listen to Rahm on how much to prioritize judges

3. Dont listen to Larry Summers on the size of your stimulus package — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) February 5, 2021

""This is clearly a new day. We are witnessing a revolution in how Democrats are considering and prioritizing judicial nominees, led by President Biden and embodied by chief of staff Ron Klain,"" Kang said.

""They are upending the model of lawyers that Democratic presidents will consider for the judiciary. Prosecutors and corporate lawyers are out; civil rights lawyers, public defenders and labor lawyers are in,"" he said.

According to a Democratic aide on Capitol Hill, Durbin will follow the same rules that the Republicans did when the committee was led by Grassley and Graham. They expect to hold hearings at a regular clip and to put forward multiple nominees on any given hearing panel. There will be an emphasis on diversity but also, following Trump, they will look for young nominees who could serve for decades.

Although some questioned whether Congress will prioritize Justice Department nominees over judges, the aide dismissed the concern.

""There is time and there is precedent for moving DOJ nominees alongside of judicial nominees,"" the aide said.

""I have every reason to believe that the nominees you will see from this White House will be eminently qualified, which was not always true for nominees you saw put forward by Trump,"" the person added.

Momentum will also come from other quarters of the White House, starting most obviously with a President and vice president who both spent time serving on the Judiciary Committee, with Biden as its former chairman.

Klain is a veteran of countless confirmation hearings and a former clerk of Justice Byron White. Paige Herwig, a former top aide to former Attorney General Loretta Lynch as well as a veteran of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Demand Justice, will serve as the nominations counsel and will receive help from Tona Boyd, Sen. Cory Booker's former chief counsel.

As Biden concentrates on nominations, he will find that his policies and initiatives, like the immigration action temporarily struck by Judge Tipton, will land in the courts.

And while Trump's nominees did not always vote in his favor, a fact that was made clear as he fought to overturn the election, by and large his nominees will share a conservative legal outlook.

Chief Justice John Roberts may have famously tried to distance the judiciary from Trump's attacks when he reprimanded the then-President in 2018 by saying that ""we do not have Obama judges or Trump judges.""

But the reality is there are Obama, Trump and Biden nominees.

And now, with a new cascade of judicial retirements and an expected avalanche of new executive orders, the judges will make a difference."
How to watch the Senate impeachment trial,"(CNN) Tuesday marks the start of former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial , with all eyes on the Senate serving as jury to deliberate whether to convict or acquit the former President .

The case arrives at the upper chamber, overseen by Senate president pro tempore Sen. Patrick Leahy , after the House voted last month to impeach Trump for a second time in a swift and bipartisan condemnation of his role inciting the January 6 riot at the US Capitol.

Senate leaders reached an agreement Monday giving the impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers up to 16 hours each to present their cases and creating the option for a debate and vote to call witnesses if the House impeachment managers seek it. But how long the trial will ultimately last and whether witnesses will actually be called remains to be seen.

Here's how to watch and what to know about the Senate impeachment trial:

How can people watch the trial?

CNN's special coverage of the trial will begin Tuesday at noon ET. Coverage will stream live and is accessible without a cable log-in on:

the CNN.com homepage

CNNgo, via CNN.com/go on desktops, smartphones and tablets

CNN's mobile apps for iOS and Android

CNNgo apps on Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Android TV, Chromecast and Roku

When will the trial get started?

The Senate will vote Tuesday on the rules agreed upon by leadership to govern the trial. The trial will kick off with a four-hour debate on the constitutionality of the proceeding followed by a vote at a simple majority threshold to affirm the proceedings' constitutionality.

Will we see witnesses?

At the request of the managers, there will be an option to hold a debate and vote on calling witnesses. But that's only keeping open the possibility -- it's not an indication on its own that the managers plan to do so.

Democrats' desire for witnesses who might be able to corroborate Trump's thinking and actions while the riots were unfolding is running into many Senate Democrats' wishes for a quick trial so they can move onto passing President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief package. The problem for the managers is it's unclear whom they could call as a witness voluntarily who could speak to Trump's mindset. Even if the Senate voted to subpoena a witness who was in the White House on January 6, there could be a court fight over executive privilege that would delay the trial.

Last week, Trump's legal team swiftly rejected House impeachments managers' request for the former President to testify , putting the decision back on the Democrats over whether to try to compel Trump's testimony with a subpoena.

How will the trial operate logistically? Are there any changes due to Covid?

A Senate official familiar with the planning said there will be seats reserved for senators in the public gallery above the chamber and the Senate's ""marble room"" that's just off the floor, where the trial will be shown on television. Senators will have to be on the Senate floor to vote.

During Trump's first impeachment trial, senators were required to sit at their desk during the lengthy arguments, though they didn't always do so. But this year, senators won't be required to remain at their desks due to the Covid-19 pandemic and social distancing.

How long will the trial go?

The trial's final end date remains unclear. For each side's allotted 16 hours for presentations slated to begin Wednesday, presentations can not exceed eight hours per day or two days total.

Who will make the case to convict or acquit the President?

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named nine members of her caucus to be impeachment managers to argue the Democrats' case in the Senate once the article of impeachment is sent to the chamber.

The impeachment managers are Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland (lead manager), Diana DeGette of Colorado, David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Joaquin Castro of Texas, Eric Swalwell of California, Ted Lieu of California, Stacey Plaskett of the US Virgin Islands, Joe Neguse of Colorado and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania.

On the other side, Trump's office announced last week that David Schoen and Bruce L. Castor Jr. would head the legal team for his second impeachment trial, a day after CNN first reported that five members of his defense left and his team effectively collapsed. Schoen was on the team of lawyers representing Roger Stone in the appeal of his conviction related to issues the former Trump adviser took with the jury. Castor, meanwhile, is a well-known attorney in Pennsylvania who previously served as Montgomery County district attorney.

Outside of official arguments, a group of House Republicans allied with Trump are reprising their role at the former President's second impeachment trial to defend him in the public debate. Roughly a half-dozen House Republicans are aiding Trump's legal defense by planning to speak to reporters during breaks in the impeachment trial, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Will the Senate still conduct any legislative business?

The Senate vote Monday night confirming Denis McDonough as Biden's secretary of Veterans Affairs could be the last confirmation vote for a Cabinet official until after the impeachment trial ends.

That could change if there is an agreement by senators, although several Republicans have said they would not consent to voting on more nominees until after the trial."

(CNN) Need a change of scenery? If you're waiting for a sign, here it is: a Mississippi city will pay you $6,000 to pick up and move there for a year.

The city of Natchez is calling on remote workers across the country to relocate to their ""charming and historic community"" for one year through a program called Shift South . And in return, they will provide $2,500 in moving expenses plus a $300 monthly stipend for one year, the city's mayor, Dan Gibson told CNN.

""We are excited to be the first and only city in the Deep South to offer an incentive like this to remote workers,"" Gibson told CNN. ""Our warm and friendly people, the (Mississippi) river at our feet, our history and our beautiful sunsets make Natchez a great city to call home.""

To qualify for the program, which has 30 slots, applicants must be employed in the US as remote workers, establish primary residency in Natchez and purchase a home valued at $150,000 or higher -- which they must own and live in for one year.

Natchez, which has a population of nearly 15,000 people and is located along the Mississippi River, has a significantly lower cost of living than the national average, according to Gibson.

Pfizer says it has increased production to double coronavirus vaccine output,"Efficiencies and upgrades in the production process have helped vaccine maker Pfizer double its output of coronavirus vaccine in the past month, a spokeswoman for the company told CNN Monday.

While the company did not give any production figures to support the estimate, spokeswoman Amy Rose said Pfizer expects production time to be cut nearly in half, from 110 days to an average of 60 days for one batch of Covid-19 vaccine.

One batch is equal to between 1 million to 3 million doses, Pfizer says.

Producing the genetic material that forms the basis of the vaccine initially took 16 days, but will soon take just nine to 10 days, Rose said.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said last week the company expects to deliver 200 million doses of its vaccine to the United States by the end of May."
Elon Musk's love-in with China may be over as regulators go after Tesla,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Elon Musk's Tesla spent the last couple of years trying to win over China in a bid to conquer the world's largest car market . Now the company risks upsetting Beijing's powerful regulators.

The electric carmaker has been summoned by five Chinese regulatory agencies to answer questions about the quality of its Shanghai-made Model 3 cars, according to a statement released Monday by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). It said regulators were concerned about several problems with the cars, including ""abnormal acceleration"" and ""battery fires.""

The meeting is troubling for Tesla. Thanks to Musk's courting of officials, Tesla had managed to avoid cumbersome restraints imposed on global rivals trying to do business in China. The company opened one of its massive car factories in 2019 to great fanfare in Shanghai, and the country now accounts for a fifth of its revenue.

But for the past few weeks, Tesla has been heavily criticized within China for a series of problems involving its cars, culminating in Monday's announcement.

""[We will] deeply reflect on the company's operational shortcomings and comprehensively strengthen self-inspection,"" Tesla said in a statement posted on Chinese social media website Weibo in response to SAMR's remarks.

""We will strictly abide by Chinese laws and regulations and always respect consumer rights,"" the carmaker said, adding that it will ""better contribute to the healthy development of China's new energy vehicle market.""

It's not clear whether regulators intend to punish Tesla or change anything about the way it operates in the country. But the controversy is a sign of just how seriously Beijing takes regulation, even among companies that it appears to favor.

""It's a slippery slope for Musk,"" said Dan Ives, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities. The CEO ""had built strong relationships within the country, but he must play nice in the sandbox in China.""

Strong support

Tesla has been in China since 2013, but in the past few years it has established a strong relationship with the Chinese government.

When the carmaker was negotiating terms with authorities in 2017 for the construction of its Shanghai Gigafactory, it managed to retain complete control — an unusual arrangement, since its peers were typically required to partner with Chinese firms if they wanted to set up a local business at that time. (China announced in 2018 that it would ease up on the automotive sector's rules on foreign ownership by 2022.)

Since then, Tesla has enjoyed strong government support. It was the only foreign manufacturer without a local partner to win a big tax break for its cars in 2019. The company also resumed production quickly during the coronavirus pandemic in part thanks to local government support.

Musk has also won over authorities and Chinese citizens alike, and is a welcomed guest in the country. He famously danced on stage during the debut of the Shanghai-made Model 3 early last year, which went viral on Weibo. Premier Li Keqiang once even said he would be happy to give Musk a ""China green card"" after the American entrepreneur said he ""loves China very much.""

Tesla's inroads into China have paid off. The company sold $6.66 billion worth of cars in China last year, contributing 21% of its revenue, according to a recent company filing . That's more than doubled what it sold in 2019, when it had not yet started making cars there.

A souring perception

Last November, state news agency Xinhua attacked the company after one of its attorneys wrote to US regulators about a recall in China, blaming ""driver abuse.""

Tesla wrote on its Weibo account last week that the video had been edited and that the employee provided ""several possible factors"" for the car's issues. Even so, the company apologized.

""We are deeply sorry, regarding the misunderstanding caused to netizens and the trouble"" caused to power authorities, the company said.

State media outlets, though, piled on after the power grid incident. Xinhua earlier this month blasted Tesla once more for its ""arrogant attitude,"" accusing the company of ""passing the buck again.""

The Global Times, a state-owned tabloid, also took the company to task.

""Though Tesla is arguably the US company most active in investing in China, the Silicon Valley-born carmaker is far from understanding Chinese consumers, as seen by its attitude in a series of scattered accident reports including explosions, drivers losing control and faulty brakes,"" read an article published by the Global Times.

Other challenges

Regulatory pressure is not Tesla's only challenge in China moving forward.

The company was the best-selling electric vehicle brand in the country last year, with 135,400 Model 3s sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

But competition is getting fierce. BYD unseated Tesla as China's top selling electric car brand last month, and other automakers like Nio, Geely and Xpeng are trying to close in.

While China has welcomed Tesla so far, experts point out that ultimately Beijing has its own ambitions to lead in tech and other fields. In other words: Once homegrown companies are competitive, the country doesn't have much need for foreign firms anymore.

Why bad news for AstraZeneca's vaccine is a roadblock on the way out of the pandemic,"(CNN) It's the news the many feared: early data shows the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may provide only ""minimal protection"" against mild to moderate illness caused by the coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa.

But this doesn't mean governments should throw out their AstraZeneca stockpiles. Experts say it's possible -- and very likely -- that the shot is still effective in preventing severe disease and death.

The news could, however, be a major roadblock on the world's way out of the pandemic, which can't 'end' until the virus stops circulating widely.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is cheaper and easier to transport and store than some of the other vaccines approved for use to date and as such, was going to play a key part in combating the pandemic in low and middle-income countries. If the vaccine isn't effective enough against the new variant, it could deepen the already huge vaccination gap between the world's richest and poorest countries.

The study has not yet been peer reviewed or published in full, so many unknowns remain. What we do know is that it included a relatively small number of volunteers who were predominantly young and healthy and therefore not likely to suffer from severe Covid-19 disease. That meant the study did not assess protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death and many experts have suggested it could still prevent these outcomes.

""In the medium term, what matters most is preventing more serious forms of Covid-19; and it is thought the AstraZeneca vaccine will do this,"" Dr Peter English, a consultant in communicable disease control, told the UK's Science Media Centre.

New vaccination strategy

Less effective vaccines could force countries where the new variants become dominant to shift their vaccination strategy.

Instead of trying to achieve herd immunity, the focus might be on preventing as many deaths as possible even while the virus continues to circulate.

South Africa is pausing its rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine following the release of the study on Sunday.

Speaking to CNN, Professor Salim Abdool Karim, who is a co-chair of South Africa's Covid-19 advisory committee, said the country will likely adopt a more ""stepped approach,"" in which they assess the impact of the vaccine as it is rolled out.

""We would start by vaccinating about 100,000 individuals in the first step. We would look at the hospitalization rates once we've done those vaccinations. And if we find that the hospitalization rates are below the threshold -- that we are looking at -- then we can be confident that the vaccine is efficacious ... and if so, we can then proceed to continuing the rollout,"" he said.

""If we find that the hospitalizations are substantial -- more than we anticipated -- then we would have to stop, take stock of where we are and perhaps switch to other vaccines.""

But the AstraZeneca vaccine is a key part of mass vaccination programs in many countries worldwide.

The UK has been administering it since last month and the government said Monday it would continue to be used. While the UK is one of the at least 41 countries where the South African variant had been detected, the number of cases caused by it remain extremely low. But the mutation found in the South African variant -- known as the E484 mutation -- has also been found independently in a samples of the variant first seen in the UK

The European Union has also approved the vaccine, although several European countries have advised against using it in older people because of limited efficacy data in that age group.

The COVAX program -- a coalition that includes Gavi and the World Health Organization with the aim of distributing Covid-19 vaccines to poorer countries -- is reliant on this vaccine. Last week, COVAX announced a plan to distribute more than 337 million doses worldwide -- of which 336 million doses are the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine and 1.2 million doses are the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Experts from COVAX said Monday that the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts is finalizing new recommendations for use of the AstraZeneca vaccine and will present them to the Director-General on Tuesday.

Other coronavirus vaccines have shown more promise against the new variants. Real-world trials of some of the other vaccines, including Johnson & Johnson and Novavax, showed some protection against the new variants. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also said their vaccines should be effective against the new variants, although their data was based on lab studies rather than real-world trials.

South African health officials said they are hoping to receive first doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by the end of the week. The country has also ordered another 20 million vaccines through a deal with Pfizer/BioNTech, but it is not clear when those doses will arrive.

Still, the AstraZeneca vaccine will be, at least initially, the most accessible option for many countries.

Relieving the burden on health services

A vaccine's role is to teach the immune system to spot and fight a virus quickly. Essentially, it helps the body remember an infection so it acts faster if you become infected. ""Your own immune system will also react to clear the virus, but without the vaccine, this reaction will be slower,"" said Dr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor and clinical virologist at the University of Leicester.

The currently available coronavirus vaccines work by inducing antibodies and T-cells that have been shown to fight the original coronavirus. Antibodies work by attaching to and attacking the proteins on the surface of the virus -- in the case of coronavirus, this is the spike protein.

If the virus changes too much, notably in its spike protein, the antibodies induced by the vaccine may not not bind to the new version of the virus very well, Tang explained.

""This means that these vaccine antibodies cannot clear as much of these viruses when you are infected so there is more virus left that needs to be cleared by your own immune response -- which reacts more slowly,"" he added.

""But the studies suggest that there is enough binding from these vaccine antibodies to at least remove some of the variant viruses from the system -- to prevent more severe disease and death.""

One of the main reasons the pandemic has been deadly is because of the sheer number of people in need of medical attention, and a partially effective vaccine, while not ideal, would reduce this burden.

There have been instances where health care systems became unable to cope with the number of patients coming in. When this happens, some patients might die because they can't access help on time. There is also a knock-on effect on the entire system, with non-urgent treatments postponed or canceled.

Experts argue that a vaccine will prove to be beneficial if it can reduce the burden on health services.

""This may look like fewer individuals requiring an ICU bed and more individuals able to recover at home,"" said Dr. Oliver Watson, an infectious diseases researcher at Imperial College London, adding that this could have ""real material consequences in settings where hospitals are very stretched.""

This has been the case in many European countries, including the UK, where the government was forced to open several field hospitals to prevent the National Health System becomes overwhelmed.

Tweaking the vaccine

The data from South Africa is no doubt a setback to vaccination campaigns but scientists are already working on updates to the existing vaccines to make them more effective against new variants.

AstraZeneca said Saturday it is working with Oxford University to adapt the vaccine against the B.1.351 variant and that it would advance it through clinical development to make it ""ready for autumn delivery should it be needed."" Last month, Pfizer said it was ""laying the groundwork"" to create a vaccine booster that could respond to coronavirus variants.

""We see this all the time with the influenza vaccine,"" said Tang. Flu vaccines are adapted each year to target the virus strains that are circulating the most. Sometimes, the vaccine picked doesn't match the strain that becomes prevalent.

""Mismatched vaccine seasons do allow more influenza infections, morbidity and mortality -- but to some extent, this is inevitable as the virus will always be mutating first -- then we will have to adjust our vaccines to match the new virus,"" Tang added.

The UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday the flu blueprint might work for the coronavirus in the future.

""The jab is updated each year according to the mutations and variations that have happened and been spotted in the preceding few months, and that is manufactured over the summer, and then delivered into the arms of those who are most vulnerable to flu in the autumn,"" he said.

When it comes to Covid-19, he explained that we need to be thinking about how to protect people in a similar way.

The good news is that developing a vaccine that would work against the new variants doesn't mean starting from scratch, so updates could become available soon.

""The genome of the variant spike protein is known, and the technology to ""plug in"" the genes for it into mRNA and vector vaccines is well-established,"" said English. ""Within months we hope to see availability of new vaccines, tailored to the South African variant."""
"Black coffee can be good for your heart, studies show","(CNN) It's another home run for coffee consumption -- as long as it's black and caffeinated, that is.

Drinking one or more cups of plain, leaded coffee a day was associated with a long-term reduced risk of heart failure, according to a review of diet data from three major studies using analytic tools from the American Heart Association.

Compared with non-coffee drinkers, the analysis found the risk of heart failure over time decreased between 5% and 12% for each cup of coffee consumed daily.

The benefit did not extend to decaffeinated coffee. Instead, the analysis found an association between decaf coffee and an increased risk for heart failure.

Heart failure occurs when a weakened heart fails to supply the body's cells with enough blood to get the oxygen needed to keep the body functioning properly. People with heart failure suffer fatigue and shortness of breath and have trouble walking, climbing stairs or other daily activities.

""While unable to prove causality, it is intriguing that these three studies suggest that drinking coffee is associated with a decreased risk of heart failure and that coffee can be part of a healthy dietary pattern if consumed plain, without added sugar and high fat dairy products such as cream,"" said registered dietitian Penny Kris-Etherton, immediate past chairperson of the American Heart Association's Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health Council Leadership Committee, in a statement. She was not involved with the research."
She's one of Europe's most powerful women. A vaccine spat could derail her big plans for the continent,"(CNN) It's likely that, a couple of weeks ago, you'd never heard the name Ursula von der Leyen.

President of the European Commission , the European Union's executive branch and most powerful institution, is not a job that enjoys the fame or the grandeur of a national leader. So if your name's appearing in the media, chances are, something's probably gone very wrong.

The EU's unedifying spat with the United Kingdom over Covid-19 vaccines has dragged von der Leyen and her management style into the spotlight.

After Brussels got jittery that its vaccination program was lagging behind, thanks to a shortage of doses, the Commission proposed placing export controls on vaccine manufacturers , meaning the EU could monitor -- and potentially prevent -- vaccines leaving the bloc.

As part of this proposal, the Commission said that those controls could be applied to vaccines going from the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU) into Northern Ireland (part of the UK).

Critics immediately panned Brussels for even toying with the idea of placing restrictions on the Irish border, for fear it could lead to the return of sectarian, cross-border violence on the island of Ireland.

A series of hurried, worried phone calls took place between European capitals who had not been consulted on this move -- including, bafflingly, Dublin.

EU diplomats and officials in Brussels were embarrassed by what appeared to be a unilateral threat from the Commission to the UK, a sovereign nation, and a clear risk to civil society in Northern Ireland -- a weird flex for an institution which purports to promote and protect peace and civility.

Embarrassment turned to anger when von der Leyen and her team tried to lay the blame on her executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.

The spat has been temporarily resolved, but there is lingering anger aimed at the Commission for threatening to take such dramatic measures. Naturally, much of that anger has been aimed at the head of the institution herself.

Ever since the vaccine spat, von der Leyen has been under an abnormal level of scrutiny -- even for someone holding such powerful office -- and plenty of critics have been more than happy to draw comparisons between her perceived failures in Berlin and Brussels.

Some believe the reason so many have been happy to take potshots at her is down to jealousy of her privileged background.

Ursula von der Leyen, who trained as a physician before going into politics, pictured with her husband and seven children in 2005.

Von der Leyen -- Germany's former defense minister -- is not your typical Eurocrat. Her father was a very powerful politician, serving as Prime Minister of the German state of Lower Saxony and as one of the first European civil servants.

""She belongs to our political elite,"" says Erich Vad, a former military policy advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel, and a close ally of the German leader. ""Not only is she from an upper-class background, but she was also one of Angela Merkel's favorites.""

""In German politics, many will have been jealous of her and that can make working in Berlin very difficult,"" Vad explains.

Whether people are jealous or not, there are comparisons to draw between her handling of scandals as defense minister and of the pandemic.

In 2013, when she was appointed to the role, von der Leyen inherited armed forces in need of reform.

""She wanted to make the German forces relevant for the 21st century by making it easier for women and people with families to serve,"" says Sophia Besch, a Berlin-based senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform.

""She wanted to root out soldiers who had sympathies for far-right politics and overhaul how the armed forces spent its budget,"" Besch explains. ""The problem was, she picked fights with lots of senior figures and became unpopular with the troops and chain of command.""

Von der Leyen was widely criticized for spending hundreds of millions of euros on private contractors to help with her reforms. While she was personally cleared of any wrongdoing by German lawmakers, she acknowledged that things had gone wrong, blaming the failures on her subordinates.

In 2017, Germany's military intelligence service reported 275 suspected cases of right-wing extremism in the forces. The cases included soldiers involved in planning violent attacks and owning Nazi memorabilia.

At the time , von der Leyen enraged the military's senior command by saying she intended to address the ""burning issues"" of ""where leadership and accountability have failed.""

Angela Merkel and von der Leyen, then defense minister, talk ahead of a 2015 vote on military action against ISIS in Syria.

Long-term observers of von der Leyen recognize this playbook and have been faintly amused to see the strategy of blame and fix repeat itself during the vaccine spat.

""Her style of governing was always to create a tight circle of loyalists around her,"" says a former colleague who still works for the German government. ""They protected her when scandals broke by deflecting blame and placing her at the front of trying to fix whatever has gone wrong.""

German lawmaker Fritz Felgentreu, from the Social Democratic Party, who serves on the parliamentary defense committee, takes a cynical view of this approach to public relations.

""I am not sure she was a great defense minister or even that interested in the armed forces,"" says Felgentreu. ""I think she wanted the job to make her case that she could succeed Merkel.""

""Defense is one of the hardest government jobs and it has ended the careers of many before her,"" he adds. ""I suppose from her perspective, if she could make a success of it, she could go on to do anything.""

Whether von der Leyen was a successful defense minister or not depends largely on who you ask.

Some think she bravely took on the top brass of the military and achieved many of her reforms; others believe that ambition and obsession with her personal brand hampered her ability to do the job.

Von der Leyen's admirers suggest that the hostility towards such an accomplished leader is driven in some part by the fact she is a woman.

""I look at the criticisms of her and think if she were a man, they wouldn't call her a control freak but a strong leader,"" says Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian politician who leads the European Parliament's Green caucus.

Senior CDU figures agree. Many believe that von der Leyen is the victim of both a European center-right political culture that is still dominated by men, and a German military culture that is still misogynistic.

Ursula von der Leyen meeting then-US President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2020.

""We were all shocked when Merkel nominated her for Germany's commissioner. Delighted for her, but shocked,"" one German defense official told CNN. ""It made sense, as she'd done a difficult job reasonably well but, my God, she had taken a credibility hit.""

Von der Leyen was a surprise choice for her current job -- not least because she wasn't even nominated for it initially.

In the summer of 2019, the EU's complicated process for electing a Commission president had become deadlocked, with the 27 member states unable to agree on any of the candidates on the table.

Then French President Emmanuel Macron had an idea.

She might not have been a Brussels insider, but von der Leyen embodied Macron's vision for Europe's next chapter.

She shared Macron's ambitions for a Europe that could throw its weight around on the world stage. She supported a common defense policy and greater integration.

The optics were also excellent for Merkel's legacy: She had secured not just the first German president of the Commission, but also the first female president.

Entirely by accident, von der Leyen became that most valuable asset in European politics: the Franco-German compromise. It's a long-standing rule in Brussels that if you want to get anything done, you have to get Paris and Berlin to agree on it.

Von der Leyen's actions since becoming the biggest fish in Brussels won't have surprised anyone who has done their homework.

""When she initially tried to win support in Parliament, she came with a team of people from Berlin who were clearly close collaborators from her time in the German government,"" says Sophie in 't Veld, a Dutch, liberal member of the European Parliament.

""She seems to have a very top-down, micro-managing style,"" in 't Veld adds. ""Commissioners don't seem to have a lot of freedom. I do think it's prone to risks, as we saw with the vaccines row.""

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen meeting in December 2020 for talks on a post-Brexit trade deal.

Diplomats representing member states agree with this view. ""I don't think she talks to many people outside of her core group, even including people in the Commission,"" one says.

But others in Brussels see von der Leyen as a breath of fresh air, and share Macron's admiration for her.

""She is very impressive, especially as she embraced the vital need for the Green transition,"" says Lamberts, the leader of the European Parliament's Green caucus. ""She wants to be properly across the detail of what she is talking about.""

""Some people may find it frustrating, because it means each meeting with her is on a specific subject,"" he says. ""But it means we can talk seriously about getting her ambitious agenda through Parliament.""

Von der Leyen's agenda for the EU is certainly aspirational. Its various themes -- tackling climate change, promoting democracy and taking control of Europe's security -- have a common thread: Europe as a geopolitical power in its own right.

Whether it's taking a lead on climate change through her European Green Deal or convincing member states that Europe needs to consolidate its defense strategy to deal with threats from Russia, von der Leyen's ambition for Europe is more overtly geopolitical than any of her predecessors.

It is notable that a German politician is so in favor of increasing Europe's defense capabilities. Back in Berlin, politicians will generally do anything to avoid advocating greater defense spending.

""She knows that the German political class is reluctant to appear hawkish on military issues,"" says Vad. ""In Brussels, she can push an agenda with France and others that wouldn't work in Berlin.""

In Germany, admirers and critics alike wonder how well-suited von der Leyen's lofty, highly political style of leadership is to running a clunky, bureaucratic institution like the European Commission -- especially in the middle of a global health crisis.

Ursula von der Leyen arriving at the EU's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, for a European Union summit in December 2020.

While much of Europe was stunned at the Commission's threat to the UK and Northern Ireland, many who knew her in Berlin found the whole chapter -- including her subsequent attempt to deflect the blame -- consistent with everything they knew about her style of politics and obsession with controlling her public image.

The question many now ask is how much damage has been done to her reputation, and what impact it might have on her broader agenda, once the pandemic is behind her.

Talking to former colleagues and current European officials, the word that repeatedly comes up is ""ambition.""

Cathryn Cluver Ashbrook, executive director of the Project on Europe and the Transatlantic Relationship at the Harvard Kennedy School, believes that the scale of von der Leyen's ambition is complimented by enormous self-confidence.

""You look at this woman, she was a physician, she had seven children, got to the top of German politics in a party that -- despite having had Merkel as leader for over a decade -- is still quite misogynistic,"" she says.

The other word that comes up often is ""charm.""

""She has a funny kind of charm,"" says Vad. ""It's not very warm, but she is cool and composed and people generally wanted to work with her. The confidence is really obvious and quite comforting.""

Cluver adds that, unlike most German politicians, von der Leyen is comfortable talking to her foreign counterparts and understands geopolitics in a way that is uncommon in Berlin.

""It's not just that she reads the nuance of international relations well, she can also express herself clearly and calmly in English and French,"" Cluver says. ""Her vision and her preparation give her the stature of a capable global leader who can negotiate with heads of state at eye level.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (L), European Council President Charles Michel (R) and European Parliament President David Sassoli (C) arrive for a meeting in Brussels in January 2020.

Whether these qualities can help her ride through the fallout of the pandemic is yet to be seen.

There is no doubt that Europe's initial response to coronavirus fell short of the mark. Hospitals in major European countries were completely overwhelmed, while member states shut their borders, blaming one another for not containing the spread.

Although health care is fully controlled by member states, it was von der Leyen's Commission that coordinated essential supplies and arranged procurement programs for PPE, ventilators and vaccines.

Of course, there have been failures in all of these areas, though even diplomats who are critical of von der Leyen accept that she is a useful scapegoat for national leaders who dropped the ball spectacularly at the start of the pandemic.

It wasn't long ago that the very idea of a European president was openly ridiculed.

The EU, as it was originally envisaged, was about economic cooperation, not creating a superstate.

In 2021, it might not be a sovereign state, but decades of closer integration mean Brussels has accrued global influence normally reserved for big nation states.

And for the first time in its history, the EU has someone at its helm who wants to leverage that influence to create something that sounds an awful lot like a global superpower.

But von der Leyen has a mountain to climb before she can put this pandemic behind her and get on with her agenda for Europe.

The danger she and her allies face is that legitimate criticism of how she's handled the greatest crisis the EU has ever faced has killed a lot of goodwill in Brussels -- and made her job post-Covid a lot harder."
"It's very risky for states to ease Covid-19 restrictions right now, experts warn","(CNN) Experts warned the US needs to be very wary of another possible surge in Covid-19 cases fueled by variants , and urged local and state leaders not to ditch their safety measures and restrictions.

""We're ... seeing what happens in other countries when these variants take over,"" emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN Monday night. ""There is (an) explosive surge, even when the countries are basically in shutdown.""

Wen, who is a former Baltimore City Health Commissioner, added that the US faces ""something really potentially catastrophic, and we should be doubling down on the measures that we know to work.""

More than 690 cases of Covid-19 variants first spotted in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been reported in the US, according to CDC data updated Sunday.

Wen's comments follow several state leaders' announcements on easing of Covid-19 safety measures.

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum announced last month the statewide mask mandate would be allowed to expire, telling CNN last week he was not concerned Covid-19 numbers would go up. In Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds recently signed an executive order ending all mask requirements, gathering restrictions and other public health emergency mandates, while encouraging residents to follow recommended safety guidelines.

And New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday New York City indoor dining can reopen at 25% capacity on February 12.

Even amid a dip in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations nationwide, easing restrictions now is ""incredibly risky,"" said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""It is absolutely essential that we continue to do steps beyond vaccination to keep this under control,"" Besser said. ""The reason for that is, that the more this virus is allowed to spread in our communities, the more we're going to see these variants spreading.""

""And if the vaccines aren't as effective against some of these variants, then we could see the gains that we're so excited about right now, we could see those reversed in a very short amount of time.""

Vaccine challenges remain

So far, more than 32 million Americans have received at least their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data . More than 9.5 million people have received both doses, the data shows.

And while officials have expressed optimism that vaccinations will continue ramping up in the coming weeks, local and state leaders continue to face challenges, including in the number of doses they have available and in ensuring equitable access to vaccines.

Los Angeles County health officials announced that starting Tuesday, the county will only offer appointments for second doses of the vaccine due to a shortage in supply.

""Scheduling an appointment right now is challenging because of the limited supply of vaccines that the county is receiving on a weekly basis,"" county health officials said in a news release. That will last for the remainder of the week.

The move comes in order to ""ensure that we have enough doses to guarantee a second dose for people who already received the first one,"" Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said during a Monday news conference.

In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement Monday the state would produce demographic data every week of where vaccine doses go, so that they will be ""held accountable"" for equitable access.

""Black and African American Kentuckians, to date, have received about 4.3% of vaccinations where we know the person's race. That is unacceptable,"" the governor said.

""About 1.1% of vaccines, where ethnicity is known, have gone to our Hispanic population -- also too low,"" he added in a statement.

For Americans who are fully vaccinated, more guidelines on what they should and should not do could be on the way, Dr. Anthony Fauci said during a meeting Monday.

""By existing guidelines, you still need to wear a mask, you still have to do social distancing, but I believe that's going to change,"" Fauci said. ""We're talking about this at the level of the CDC.""

What travel could look like

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN on Monday the CDC is also ""looking at all its options,"" after he was asked whether there could soon be a measure introduced that requires Covid-19 testing before domestic flights.

""What we know is that it's the appropriate measure for international travel, people traveling into the US given some of those considerations. You know I'd say the domestic picture is very different, but you know the CDC is always evaluating what can best be done to keep Americans safe,"" Buttigieg said.

When asked if he supports the idea of requiring proof of a Covid-19 vaccination before air travel, Buttigieg said that is up to the CDC.

""That's not a step that has been taken, and again the CDC is really in the lead on deciding what the right measures will be,"" Buttigieg said. ""Right now the focus, especially at a time when most Americans haven't had a vaccine, haven't had access to a vaccine, is to make sure that while we're getting those vaccinations out to everybody we possibly can, we're also maintaining those measures that we know are available and that work, like wearing a mask.""

More than 2.9 million children have had Covid-19

Meanwhile, a new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association said more than 2.9 million children have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic's start.

Covid-19 cases in children represent nearly 13% of all US cases, the report added.

In the week between January 28 to February 4, more than 117,000 new child infections were recorded, the report added, while in the two weeks ending February 4, there was a 10% increase in Covid-19 cases in children.

Severe illness from the virus remains rare among children, the report said.

""However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,"" it added."
The UAE's Hope Probe is arriving at Mars and will attempt to orbit it,"(CNN) The United Arab Emirates' first mission to Mars arrives at the red planet on Tuesday and will attempt a tricky maneuver to place it in orbit. The Emirates Mars Mission is known as the Hope Probe, and it is expected to arrive at Mars and send back a signal at 10:42 a.m. ET.

The UAE Space Agency will share live coverage of Hope's arrival on February 9 beginning at 10 a.m. ET on its website

When the spacecraft arrives, the Hope Probe will mark the UAE as only the fifth country in history to reach the red planet. The ambitions of the mission don't stop there.

The probe, along with its three scientific instruments, is expected to create the first complete portrait of the Martian atmosphere. The instruments will collect different data points on the atmosphere to also gauge seasonal and daily changes.

This information will provide scientists with an idea of what climate dynamics and weather are like in different layers of the Martian atmosphere. Together, this will shed light on how energy and particles, like oxygen and hydrogen, move through the atmosphere and how they even escape Mars.

The mission was one of three that launched to Mars from Earth in July, including NASA's Perseverance rover and China's Tianwen-1 mission. Hope will orbit the planet, Tianwen-1 will orbit the planet and land on it, and Perseverance will land on Mars.

All three missions launched around the same time due to an alignment between Mars and the Earth on the same side of the sun, making for a more efficient journey to Mars. Hope is the first of those missions to arrive at Mars; Tianwen-1 is expected to arrive on February 10 and Perseverance on February 18.

Arrival at Mars

The Hope Probe is moving with such speed toward Mars that if it doesn't slow down appropriately upon arrival, the spacecraft will literally use Mars' gravity to slingshot it through deep space.

Almost half of the spacecraft's fuel will be used to slow it down enough for the spacecraft to be captured by Mars' gravity and go into orbit.

By firing its thrusters for 30 minutes before reaching Mars, it will slow down from a speed of more than 75,185 miles per hour to 11,184 miles per hour.

The Hope Probe's team considers this phase of the spacecraft's arrival at Mars, called the Mars Orbit Insertion phase, just as critical and risky as launching the spacecraft. And much like Perseverance will essentially land itself on Mars without any interference from NASA, Hope will be able to react to any issues and take care of itself, to some degree.

Once Hope has established an orbit around Mars, it will make contact with Earth through a ground station in Spain. One-way light time between Mars and the Earth takes between 10 and 11 minutes, so the signal will be slightly delayed.

""Less than half of the spacecraft that have been sent to Mars have actually made it successfully,"" said Pete Withnell, program manager for the mission at the University of Colorado Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. ""But this is a highly practiced, highly simulated and highly analyzed event. I cannot imagine being better prepared than we are right now.""

Capturing a new view

After the gravity of Mars captures Hope, it will enter an elliptical orbit around the planet, coming as close as 621 miles above the Martian surface and as distant as 30,683 miles from it. It will take Hope about 40 hours to complete one orbit.

The probe will send back its first image of Mars during this time.

Hope will stay in this phase, called the capture orbit, between February and mid-May during the transition stage of the mission, according to David Brain, deputy principal investigator for MAVEN orbiter, or the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN , at the University of Colorado Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics.

During this transition, the ground teams will send some commands to the spacecraft to test the instruments and make observations of Mars to see if any of the instruments need tweaking.

Then, it will be time to maneuver Hope into the science orbit, which will allow the probe's instruments to begin capturing scientific data of Mars.

Hope will complete one scientific orbit of the planet every 55 hours. This orbit will provide the first global picture of weather and atmospheric dynamics on Mars, which will be shared with the scientific community via the mission's data center.

The mission is expected to last two years, with the possibility of being extended for a third year.

The probe will be in a different orbit from past spacecraft that have visited Mars.

""It's a very high altitude orbit, much higher than any other Mars science missions,"" Brain said. ""In that high altitude orbit, where our instruments observe Mars from the global perspective, it will always be seeing roughly half of Mars no matter where we are in the orbit when we look at the planet.""

The orbit will take the probe fairly close to parallel with the Martian equator, which will enable the spacecraft to capture data at different times of day on the planet. And the fact that it's an elliptical, or oval-shaped, orbit means that observations will be captured close to as well as distant from Mars.

""It can observe many geographic regions at a single time of day when the whole probe gets close to Mars and speeds up, and it can match the speed at which Mars is spinning on its axis,"" Brain said. ""It can hover above a single geographic region like the big volcano, Olympus Mons, and study the atmosphere there at many times of day.""

Every nine days of the mission, the probe will have completely captured a picture of the Martian atmosphere.

""We will have observed every geographic region at every time of day, every nine days,"" Brain said."
Truck driver survives 70-foot plunge off an icy roadway as freezing weather snarls traffic across Midwest,"(CNN) A driver survived a 70-foot plunge off of a roadway Saturday and a Wisconsin Department of Transportation traffic camera recorded the dramatic scene.

The incident is just one of many that have occurred across the Midwest where snow, sub-zero temperatures and freezing rain have created dangerous, icy roadway conditions.

More than 41 million people remain under winter weather alerts that stretch from Oklahoma to Cape Cod, according to CNN Meteorologist Michael Guy.

Icy weather creates dangerous road conditions

Deputies with the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) responded to the one-car crash at around 9:49 a.m. on Saturday in the westbound distress lane on Interstate 94, the sheriff's office said in a series of tweets

When the deputies arrived, they found the red pickup truck that had skidded off the ramp sitting upright in the roadway below.

The driver had lost control of his vehicle as he was driving on the interchange ramp, according to MCSO.

""The vehicle traveled up a snowbank, proceeded over the barrier wall, and descended 70 feet down onto the westbound I-94 distress lane,"" the sheriff's office said.

The driver was conscious, breathing and did not show signs of impairment, according to the sheriff's office. He was taken to a local hospital by the Milwaukee Fire Department.

In Oklahoma, freezing rain created icy roadways leading to more than 380 car crashes in the state by 5 p.m. Monday, according to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol/Department of Public Safety (OHP/DPS).

At least 20 cars were caught in a pile up on I40 in Oklahoma City Monday.

Early Monday morning, Oklahoma City Police warned in a tweet that cold temperatures had frozen over bridges, causing several crashes.

Two people died and people suffered injuries in at least 130 of the incidents Oklahoma State Troopers responded to, according to the tweet.

At least 20 cars were caught in a pile up on I-40, the main thruway of Oklahoma City, Monday, OHP Trooper Eric Foster said during a press briefing Monday.

Foster said that an unknown number of people were injured during multiple collisions along an icy bridge."
Two US Navy aircraft carriers conduct South China Sea drills,"(CNN) Two US Navy aircraft carrier strike groups began operations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea on Tuesday, the latest show of naval capabilities by the Biden administration as it pledges to stand firm against Chinese territorial claims.

The carriers USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Nimitz and their accompanying guided-missile cruisers and destroyers are showing the US Navy's ability to operate in highly trafficked, challenging environments, the US Navy said in statement.

The two strike groups have about 120 combat aircraft between them.

US Navy aircraft fly over the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group and the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea on February 9, 2021.

China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea. Since 2014 it has transformed obscure reefs and sandbars into man-made artificial islands, fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems -- antagonizing governments with overlapping claims, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan.

Beijing reacted harshly seven months ago when the US deployed two carrier strike groups there, the first time in six years that two carriers had operated in tandem in the South China Sea.

"Nearly 15,000 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in New York nursing homes and adult care facilities, data shows","(CNN) The New York State Department of Health is continuing to release data shedding more light on Covid-19 deaths among residents in the state's long-term care facilities, after a state Supreme Court judge ordered the department to fulfill a watchdog group's Freedom of Information request.

The health department has recorded nearly 15,000 confirmed and presumed Covid-19 deaths among long-term care facility residents in the state since March 1, the data shows -- the vast majority of which were nursing home resident deaths.

The data comes after the state attorney general's office said in a late January report that the health department undercounted Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents by about 50%.

What the new data shows

The long-term facilities covered in the data include both nursing homes and adult care facilities, but the health department data makes a distinction between the two sub-categories: It defines 'adult care facilities' as assisted-living facilities and other congregate care settings that are not licensed to provide full medical services, while 'nursing homes' are considered a separate group defined as ""places to live where care is available for people of all ages who need 24-hour nursing care and supervision outside of a hospital,"" in accordance with New York public health law.

Japanese submarine collides with commercial ship while surfacing in Pacific,"Tokyo (CNN) A Japanese submarine collided with a commercial ship as it attempted to surface off the country's Pacific coast on Monday, government officials said.

Three crew members from the Maritime Self-Defense Force submarine Soryu suffered minor injuries, and pictures from the Japanese Coast Guard showed it sustained damage to its fairwater planes, the winglike structures on its conning tower.

The accident occurred off the main island of Shikoku in southern Japan.

The Soryu, commissioned in 2009, is the first in its class of Japanese diesel electric-powered submarines. It displaces about 3,000 tons and has a crew of around 65.

The Defense Ministry said communications equipment on the sub was also damaged, although it was still able to operate.

Number of newborns registered in China drops 15% amid population decline fears,"Hong Kong (CNN) The number of newborns registered with the government in China dropped almost 15% last year, amid widespread concern over falling birthrates in the world's most populous country .

According to figures published by the Ministry of Public Security this week, there were 10.03 million new babies registered in 2020, compared to 11.79 million the year before -- a decrease of 14.9%. The news comes as last year, China recorded the lowest birthrate since the People's Republic was founded in 1949

China's demographic issues could pose serious issues for the world's second-largest economy when the current working-age population reaches retirement. Experts worry if the trend continues, or the population begins shrinking, China may get old before it gets rich.

According to the most recent data from the National Bureau of Statistics, there were 250 million people over 60 years old in China last year, around 18% of the population.

""The impact of Covid has probably exaggerated it, and in coming years the drops probably won't be so bad, but that downward structural trend is likely to continue,"" he said. ""The number of new babies born is never going to be that high in future, because the number of childbearing women is declining, and will be declining rapidly (in years to come).""

While China's demographic shift is still nothing compared to some of its hyper-aged neighbors -- such as Japan and South Korea , both of whose populations are now shrinking -- it still poses potential problems in future, particularly as the ""one child"" generation ages.

In force from 1979 to 2015 , the ""one child policy"" limited most couples in China to a single baby, as part of an attempt at controlling a rapidly growing population while the country was still developing. Draconian enforcement of the rule saw couples hit with heavy fines or penalties, while millions women were forced to have abortions if they were found to be carrying a second child.

As a result of the policy, China's fertility rate fell dramatically , from a peak of almost six births per woman between 1960 and 1965 to 1.5 between 1995 and 2014. At the same time, the number of people over the age of 65 increased from 3.36% in 1965 to almost 10% in 2015, when the one child policy was switched to allowing two children. In 2019, people over the age of 65 accounted for 12.6% of the total population

Since 2016, couples have been allowed to have two children, but it appears to have been too late to turn around the decline, with parents settling into the trend common in most developed countries of having fewer children. The next national census, counting of which began in November , is expected to show a decline for the first time in decades, and could mean India overtakes China as the most populous country.

By 2050, a third of the population, around 480 million people, are expected to be over 60, with many younger workers from one-child families supporting their parents and two sets of grandparents, in a country where social services for the elderly are still lacking. Uncertainty over the official figures put out by the government could also mean the situation is worse than it currently appears.

China's leaders are very aware of the potential toll an aging population could take, hamstringing the country's economy just as it is on the verge of becoming the world's largest, and have been attempting to encourage people to have children -- after decades of punishing those who did.

It's not just marrying someone, it's to marry the in-laws, take care of children -- there are a lot of responsibilities that come with marriage. Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, a sociologist

In 2018, the People's Daily, official mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, ran a full page editorial saying ""Giving birth is a family matter and a national issue too,"" which warned that ""the impact of low birth rates on the economy and society has begun to show.""

Women, who bore the brunt of the one child policy, are also coming under fire in the new push to have more children. After decades of encouraging women to join the workforce, pressure to marry and give birth is increasing, even as many millennial women are turning away from the idea of matrimony altogether

Between 2013 and 2019, the number of people getting married for the first time in China fell by 41%, from 23.8 million to 13.9 million. While the decline is driven in part by demographics -- the one-child policy means there are simply less people to marry -- there has also been a shift in attitudes towards marriage, especially among young women, some of whom are growing disillusioned with the institution for its role in entrenching gender inequality, experts say.

""With increased education, women gained economic independence, so marriage is no longer a necessity for women as it was in the past,"" Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore who has studied marriage and family across Asian societies, told CNN last year. ""Women now want to pursue self-development and a career for themselves before they get married.""

But gender norms and patriarchal traditions have not caught up with these changes. In China, many men and parents-in-law still expect women to carry out most of the childcare and housework after marriage, even if they have full-time jobs.

""Just putting a poster up to say having two children is a great thing is not enough, it's nowhere near enough,"" said Gietel-Basten, the HKUST demographer, pointing to the economic hit that women still suffer as a result of having children. ""There's just not the social policy support to offset that negative impact.""

As the trend has become apparent , along with falling birth rates, China's government has increased pressure on young people, especially young women, to marry and settle down. In 2007, the state-backed All-China Women's Federation coined ""leftover women"" to describe those unmarried over 27, a term which has since been adopted by the Ministry of Education and is widely used in state media to shame women who marry late or avoid matrimony altogether.

The government has also made it more difficult to end existing marriages, with China's national legislature last year introducing a 30-day ""cooling-off"" period for people filing for divorce. This was met with widespread criticism, particularly amid growing outcry over domestic violence in China.

Gietel-Basten said pressuring a shrinking population of women to have more children was unlikely to have much effect, however, especially as childlessness, currently rare in China, can be expected to increase to levels seen elsewhere in the region. Instead, the government should be preparing, as some of its neighbors have started doing, for an aging society, to offset potential repercussions.

""Yes the population is aging, and in the future the population will decline, what you need to do is say how can we make the most of the people we have,"" he added. ""You can do that through increasing productivity, through changes in education, reforms to the pension system, the healthcare system, by investing now to mitigate against bigger issues in the future."""
"House Democrats' stimulus check plan would exclude families earning more than $200,000","Washington (CNN) House Democrats have rejected a Republican proposal to significantly narrow eligibility for further stimulus payments and are moving forward with legislation that would provide $1,400 stimulus payments per person.

But the payments would phase out faster than earlier rounds and completely cut off individuals earning more than $100,000 and couples earning more than $200,000, according to the bill text, which the House Ways and Means Committee is set to debate Wednesday.

Under the plan put forward Monday by Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, the full payment would go to individuals earning less than $75,000 a year and married couples earning less than $150,000 -- like previous stimulus checks. Joint filers would receive $2,800 plus another $1,400 per dependent.

It would not narrow eligibility as significantly as a Republican-backed proposal, which would have excluded an estimated 29 million households that received earlier payments.

The GOP plan called for smaller payments of $1,000 to individuals earning less than $40,000 a year and couples earning less than $80,000. The payments would phase out faster, cutting off individuals making more than $50,000 and couples making more than $100,000.

Rise in attacks on elderly Asian Americans in Bay Area prompts new special response unit,"(CNN) Several unprovoked attacks on elderly Asian Americans, including at least three in the Bay Area captured in disturbing videos in recent days, have raised concerns about anti-Asian bias related to the Covid-19 pandemic.

At a news conference in Oakland's Chinatown on Monday, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley announced the creation of a special response unit focused on crimes against Asians, and particularly older Asians.

""The rapid increase in criminal acts targeted against members of the Asian community, particularly Chinese Americans, who live and work in Alameda County is intolerable,"" she said.

The new unit stems from two similar attacks in northern California last week as well as a spate of crime in Oakland's Chinatown.

In San Francisco, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old from Thailand, died after he was abruptly attacked while out on a morning walk January 28, according to San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin. A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and elder abuse in the case, he said.

""This was a horrific, senseless attack, and I send my deepest condolences to the Ratanapakdee family for this unthinkable pain,"" Boudin said in a statement. ""My heart goes out to the entire (Asian American Pacific Islander) community for the harm and fear this tragedy has inflicted.""

And in nearby Oakland's Chinatown neighborhood, police said a man violently shoved three unsuspecting people just after noon January 31, injuring a 91-year-old man, 60-year-old man and 55-year-old woman.

""It's not unique to Chinatown or to the Asian community the increase in crime we've seen across the city and across the county, but we have seen in the last several weeks and month a very specific increase in crimes committed against Asians,"" O'Malley said.

A 28-year-old man has been charged with three counts of felony assault for the attacks, according to charging documents. The man was placed on a psychiatric hold February 1 for a separate incident in which he was again assaulting people, the documents state.

How pandemic rhetoric sparked anti-Asian bias

The two incidents do not appear to be directly connected, and there is no evidence as to their motivations.

Still, they have heightened existing concerns around rising anti-Asian bigotry, which has become more prominent since the world first learned of a new illness in Wuhan, China.

""It's absolutely tragic, and unfortunately this has been a trend we've seen over this past year with respect to anti-Asian violence, and a lot of it stemming from rhetoric that we have seen related to the coronavirus,"" said John C. Yang, the president and executive director of the civil rights organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice.

That rhetoric started with former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly referred to the illness as the "" China virus ."" The World Health Organization chose the innocuous name ""Covid-19"" because location-specific names are both inaccurate and can lead to bigotry against people from that location.

Indeed, a sizable number of Asian Americans have said they have experienced racism and xenophobia related to the pandemic.

There is yet no uniform crime data on anti-Asian incidents connected to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, a Pew research study from last June found nearly a third of Asian Americans said they'd been subject to racist slurs or jokes since the pandemic began, while 26% said they feared someone might physically attack them.

Actors team up to fight bias

Actor Daniel Wu, who grew up in the Bay Area, spoke at a news conference Monday condemning anti-Asian bias in Oakland's Chinatown.

The attacks on the older Asian Americans in the Bay Area have brought these long-simmering issues to the surface.

A widely shared video by activist Amanda Nguyen highlighted several incidents of what she said were anti-Asian racism. And over the weekend, actors Daniel Wu and Daniel Dae Kim teamed up to offer a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the Oakland Chinatown attacks.

Wu, who grew up in the Bay Area, said Monday in Oakland's Chinatown area that he put up the reward to bring national attention to the plight of Asian Americans.

""We're being smashed in as a one-two punch. There's low-level petty crime that's happening to our community. We're being targeted as easy targets,"" he said. ""But at a bigger scale, racist rhetoric from the pandemic has targeted us as being 'the reason for coronavirus,' and so Asians across the board have been targeted by racial slurs, being attacked, being pushed around, being spat on.""

O'Malley, the district attorney, acknowledged the particular impact of this anti-Asian rhetoric.

""To still be calling it 'Chinese virus,' things like that, that fuels hate and fuels aggression and that hate and aggression results in many times -- sometimes it's words -- but a lot of times it's through committing assault or other types of crimes,"" she added.

Des To, the owner of Alice Street Bakery in Oakland's Chinatown, said the recent attacks in her neighborhood may also be connected to the Chinese New Year celebration on Friday.

""They know that it's close to Chinese New Year and people will go out to buy stuff and may have more cash on hand, so I believe every year there's more robberies or something like that,"" she told CNN. ""But this year, actually they've been worse.""

Biden signs executive order on anti-Asian bias

Joe Biden's administration has taken a sharply different tack from the previous one to try to address these issues.

In his first week on the job, President Biden signed an executive memorandum acknowledging that ""inflammatory and xenophobic rhetoric has put Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) persons, families, communities, and businesses at risk.""

The memo directed the Department of Health and Human Services to consider issuing Covid-19 guidance to advance language access and sensitivity toward the AAPI community.

CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday whether the Biden administration would take further steps to address the issue, and whether the President had seen the videos.

""I'm not aware that he's seen the videos, but he is concerned about the discrimination against, the actions against the Asian American community, which is why he signed the executive order and why he's been outspoken in making clear that attacks, verbal attacks, any attacks of any form, are unacceptable and we need to work together to address them,"" she said.

""But obviously the executive order is something he did very early in his administration ... because he felt it was so important to put a marker down."""
Latinos are navigating barriers to Covid-19 vaccinations and experts say it comes down to access,"Chicago (CNN) One Chicago doctor says that low vaccination rates among Latinos isn't just due to their hesitancy.

In many cases, emergency room physician Dr. Marina Del Rios says, it actually comes down to questions of logistics and access.

""Most people are willing to get vaccinated, Dr. Del Rios told CNN. But ""they have more questions related to 'where can I get the vaccine, when will it be my turn, is it going to cost me money?'""

Nationwide, Hispanic or Latino residents contracted Covid-19 at nearly twice the rate of White people and were hospitalized more than four times the rate of White people, according to recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And just under 12% of those vaccinated in the first month of the rollout were Hispanic or Latino.

Since March, Hispanic residents in Chicago have accounted for more confirmed coronavirus cases than any other demographic . Equitable distribution in Chicago was an early concern among health officials in the area, who worried that the city's pharmacy deserts could worsen the inequities of the pandemic's effects in the city.

The city has made an effort to make the vaccine more readily available. Unlike many large metro areas, Chicago is allowing drugstores like Walgreens to vaccinate those eligible, along with smaller local pharmacies in the area.

Still, distribution sites are clustered in the city's whiter areas and are far more sparsely spread out in the city's south and west sides, where most residents are Black or Hispanic. Black and Hispanic Chicagoans have received a combined 38% of first doses of the vaccine, while White residents have received almost 50%, according to a CNN analysis.

Dr. Del Rios, who works at the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago, likened the vaccination distribution process to ""playing the Hunger Games.""

""If you're not tied already to a medical home, which is a reality for a lot of Latinos who are undocumented or uninsured, then your chances of getting vaccinated any time soon are slim to none.""

What are the barriers?

Fahida Martinez has lived and worked in Chicago's Little Village for many years. As someone whose job is primarily focused on community outreach, working from home during the pandemic wasn't ideal. She ended up on phone and on Zoom with members of the community more than she had ever been before.

Martinez recently got her first dose of the vaccine, and said she feels privileged that she was among the first.

Work schedules can create roadblocks for many people who want the vaccine, she told CNN.

More appointments in the morning, at night and throughout the weekend would provide people with more chances to get the vaccine, Martinez said.

""I would like, for example, the clinics, or locations where they're giving the vaccine, to have hours ... lots in the morning, just like in the evening, to give people the opportunity,"" she said. ""Even Saturdays and Sundays when people don't have to leave their work day.

As the rollout continues vaccine distribution sites need to have flexible hours, experts say.

Fahida Martinez, a community health worker.

Katya Nuques, the executive director of Enlace Chicago, a community organization, said 44% of residents in Little Village are uninsured and an estimated 25% are undocumented.

Enlace focuses on education, violence prevention, immigration, and health and all of them are connected to Covid-19, she says.

""You basically have to do two things at the same time. One is to educate a community,"" she told CNN. ""On the other hand, you need to provide the availability and to provide the vaccine and those two things are not connected.""

Rios, the emergency physician said, ""if you're not tied already to a medical home, which is a reality for a lot of Latinos who are undocumented or uninsured, then your chances of getting vaccinated any time soon are slim to none.""

As a frontline worker, Dr. Del Rios was among the first to get the vaccine, and the first in Chicago.

""Why not step up and show my own community 'hey, I'm OK with getting vaccinated, I know the data, and can tell you what side effects you should expect,'"" she said.

How to ensure 'everyone gets this'

Hospitals, for example, must ensure their entire workforce, including the food and maintenance staff, receive all correspondence about signing up to get the vaccine, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.

Black, Latino and Asian Americans make up 41% of health care workers while 59% are White, according to Kaiser. And the majority of workers in long-term health care settings, 52%, are people of color.

Benjamin said the vaccine also needs to be administered outside of traditional hours so people who work hourly, frontline jobs don't have to take off work. Communities, he said, should consider a plan for transporting poor families without vehicles to health facilities to get the vaccine.

""You have to say, 'I want to make sure everyone gets this,'"" Benjamin said. ""We have to make sure we think about all the ways that people can give in (to getting vaccinated) and we have to make sure we have vaccine available for them when they call in.""

Some researchers said it was alarming to have disparities so early in the process when most of the people getting vaccinated are health care workers.

Dr. Fola May, a health equity researcher at the UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity, said she would expect health care workers to be the most informed and the least hesitant about science.

May fears this could be indicative of bigger racial gaps when the vaccine becomes widely available.

""I think we've botched this,"" May said. ""If we're seeing it in this population that should have the least biases against science, then when we look into the bigger populations we're going to have even fewer people who have the right information and access."""

Opinion: A trio of House GOP women could alter the outcome of the 2022 election,"Richard N. Bond was the Republican National Committee chairman from 1992-1993. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) A trio of Republican women in the US House of Representatives dominated the political headlines last week, and their stories will undoubtedly impact the GOP's chances of retaking the House in 2022. Indeed, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Claudia Tenney of New York each illustrate the political topography of the midterm electoral battlefield.

Let's begin with Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who now chairs the House Republican Conference and serves as the third highest-ranking member in House GOP leadership.

Cheney's vote, along with that of nine other Republicans , to impeach former President Donald Trump for his role in the Capitol insurrection, riled her fellow House Republicans. A group of House Republicans even attempted to remove her from GOP leadership but were rebuffed in a 145-61 secret ballot last week.

Cheney amplified her support for Trump's impeachment on Fox News this Sunday. She issued a blistering condemnation of the former president, saying that his lies directly led to the deadly attack on the Capitol. Further, she stated that Republicans must be "" the party of truth ,"" and that the "" single greatest threat to our republic is a president who would put his own self-interest above the Constitution, above the national interest.""

Still, for Cheney and the nine other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, it is events in their districts that will shape the 2022 elections. Trump loyalists in Wyoming are incensed with Cheney. And, so far, seven of the 10 Republicans are already facing challengers. It is likely the remaining three, Rep. John Katko of New York, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington and Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, could also face challenges. And Katko risks losing the all-important Conservative Party endorsement in New York, on whose line he received 21,062 votes -- 60% of his 34,929 vote-winning margin

Thus far, six of the 10 members have been censured for their impeachment vote by a combination of local and state party Republican groups, further increasing these members' vulnerability in primary elections.

JUST WATCHED Liz Cheney speaks after House GOP vote Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Liz Cheney speaks after House GOP vote 01:40

Of course, a lot can happen between now and the spring of 2022, when several of these members will compete in primaries to hold onto their seats. In the case of these Republicans, the later the primary, the better. It will give members more time to build a record of vigorously opposing liberal excesses by the Biden administration and House Democrats, thereby providing a powerful counterbalance to an impeachment vote cast many months in the past.

The composition of the primary electorate is also a crucial factor. Six of the states from which they hail — Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina, Washington and Wyoming — allow voters unaffiliated with a party or who register with a party on the day of the primary to participate in their Republican primaries. This enables Cheney and several of her colleagues to expand the primary voting electorate to include non-traditional Republican voters who often vote the person, rather than the party. Only New York is limited to exclusively Republican voters in its primaries.

Finally, for the GOP 10, next to Cheney in outspokenness is Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who will have an early primary in March 2022. Consequently, the survival of Kinzinger in an open primary will be a powerful indicator of how the rest of the GOP 10 will fare against their challengers.

Next, there is the case of Greene. Most political news consumers are aware of her previously stated beliefs in absurd conspiracy theories (several of which she has recently disavowed), her devotion to Trump's big lie about a stolen election and her threats on social media against House Democrats. The recent action by House Democrats and 11 House Republicans to strip her of committee assignments will help deprive her of additional congressional platforms from which to air her outlandish views. Now, she will be relegated to being a member of what I would call the ""loudmouth caucus.""

That said, so long as she is in Congress and can espouse her radical ideas, Greene will remain a liability for the GOP, because she will give Democrats and political pundits the opportunity to portray her as representative of Republican Party as a whole. If, however unlikely it may be, she refocuses her efforts on articulating a populist (and accurate) alternative to Biden and House Democrat proposals, then she may be of service to the party.

But until Greene proves she has changed tact, the congressional action against Greene, the barring of Trump and other conspiracy theorists from reputable social media platform, and the recent cancellation of Trump-enabler Lou Dobbs' television show on Fox News, are a welcome trend of pushback against cancerous elements undermining democracy and civil society. They are also the best way forward for the party: continue to respectfully, yet forcefully, discredit the stolen election lie, while focusing voters' attention on new GOP policy ideas and opposing Democratic overspending. Indeed, Cheney took this exact approach in her Fox News interview

Then there is Tenney, recently declared the winner in the nation's last outstanding congressional race. Tenney represents the final House seat the GOP gained in 2020, and all without losing a single incumbent. This now gives House Speaker Nancy Pelosi only a 221-211 margin in the House, until two Louisiana special elections are held on March 20 and taking into account the this week's death of Rep. Ron Wright of Texas. This math means Pelosi can only lose a handful of Democratic votes on any issue, which signifies, at best, a tenuous control over the US House.

Tenney's victory is a rebuke of the dominant narrative that says the GOP has a gender and diversity issue. Nineteen of the new GOP members are women , more than doubling the number of Republican women in the House. Among them are military veterans, Hispanics, Korean-Americans and a Native American. Of the newly elected men who defeated Democrat incumbents, one is African American, one is Portuguese American and one is Cuban American. These results are encouraging for the party and indicate Republicans can still be quite competitive.

So, it is game on for control of the US House in 2022. The GOP path forward is not simple given internal party conflicts and discordant voices. But Tenney and her diverse freshman class, along with the remarkable gains made by Republicans in 2020 at the state and local level, provide a solid foundation for the GOP's fondest dream: dethroning Pelosi as the speaker of the House of Representatives.

"At least 15 people died in avalanches last week, the deadliest week of US avalanches on record","(CNN) Andy Jessen was the mayor pro tempore of Eagle, Colorado. Sarah Moughamian , a lover of all things outdoors, spent all the free time she had in the Utah snow. Army Ranger Matthew Nyman survived a helicopter crash in Iraq that crushed his foot but he learned to climb again, most recently on Alaska's Bear Mountain.

Jessen, Moughamian and Nyman are three of the 15 people who died in avalanches between February 1 and February 8. It's the highest number of avalanche deaths recorded in a seven-day period since the US Forest Service's National Avalanche Center started tracking deaths, according to Karl Birkeland, the center's director.

The most recent avalanche death happened Monday, when Steve Houle, a 28-year veteran of the Washington State Patrol, was killed in Kittitas County , about an hour from Seattle. The other deaths occurred across six other states:

At least 21 people in the US have died in avalanches since the start of the season in December 2020, according to Avalanche.org , a site from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center that tracks nationwide avalanche accidents.

Avalanches caused devastating damage across the world this week, too: A glacier burst triggered an avalanche in India's northern Uttarakhand state on Sunday, killing at least 19 people.

Why it's been an active year for avalanches

There are two probable reasons why there have been more avalanche deaths this year: More people are enjoying the outdoors in the wilder parts of the West and a ""really dangerous snow pack,"" said Nikki Champion, a forecaster at the Utah Avalanche Center.

This year's avalanche season has likely been more active because of a ""persistent weak layer"" of snow, she said.

Snowfall was relatively minor in November and December compared to years previously, and because there were periods of dryness in the early winter, that early snowfall doesn't bond together, she said. That weak layer of snowfall is making up the base of the snowpack across the West, including Utah, Colorado and Montana. All the new snow is sitting on top of that weak base, Champion said.

That layer is more persistent in years past, too, she said. Utah and Colorado are experiencing less snow than usual, so that weak bottom layer is sticking around for months.

The uptick in deaths might also be explained by the increase in people visiting the West's backcountry to ski and hike. Since many ski resorts have shuttered during the pandemic, ""more people are choosing to enter the back country,"" Champion said.

How to avoid getting stuck in an avalanche

Champion advises checking with local offices for the avalanche forecast. If you're set on skiing through the backcountry, bring the appropriate avalanche gear, she says, including a shovel, beacon and probe -- and take a partner with you.

The best advice, though, is avoiding areas where an avalanche might occur, Champion said.

""This isn't really a problem you can outsmart,"" she said."
"40 hospitals across Washington state may have received counterfeit N95 masks, officials say","(CNN) Hospitals across Washington state thought they were receiving authentic N95 masks, but it turns out that hundreds of thousands may be counterfeit, according to officials.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a fraud alert Friday to the Washington State Hospital Association (WSHA), stating that 40 hospitals across the state may have received fake masks as part of a shipment of 2 million masks that arrived in December, WSHA President and CEO Cassie Sauer told CNN Monday.

The hospital association alerted the 40 hospitals, but many of the masks had already been used, Sauer said.

""They look and feel and fit and smell just like a 3M Mask,"" Sauer said.

The masks were purchased by hospitals and by WSHA to distribute to its members, according to the association. More than $1 million was spent on the purchase.

"Leadership failures led to major Covid outbreak on aircraft carrier, watchdog report finds","(CNN) The leadership of the USS Theodore Roosevelt failed to put in place measures to stop a coronavirus outbreak on board the aircraft carrier and exacerbated a growing problem by releasing sailors too early from quarantine, a Department of Defense inspector general investigation concluded.

The report , consistent with a deeper investigation into the outbreak in which nearly 20% of the crew tested positive for Covid-19, also found that four out of five Navy component commands did not run a biennial infectious disease exercise that may have helped reduce the spread of the virus.

""USS Theodore Roosevelt leadership did not effectively implement mitigation measures for the majority of their crew,"" the report said. Social gathering areas on board the ship remained open, while ""non-essential"" urine tests for illegal substances continued, the report added. In addition, sailors were released early from quarantine because conditions were crowded, and the ship's leadership ""believed that the quarantine caused more sailors to become infected.""

The commander of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, Capt. Brett Crozier, was relieved of command in early April after writing a letter to his superiors warning that action was needed to save the lives of his crew. An initial probe into Crozier's handling of the outbreak recommended that he be reinstated, but then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper did not immediately accept the recommendation. A more thorough investigation released in June recommended the firing of Crozier , faulting him for improper social distancing and being too slow to evacuate soldiers from the ship once it arrived in port in Guam.

The USS Theodore Roosevelt was one of only two ships to go through a coronavirus outbreak while at sea. The carrier had just finished a port call in Vietnam when the ship's first case of Covid-19 was diagnosed on March 24. Within weeks, more than 1,000 members of the ship's 4,900-member crew also tested positive, prompting the Navy to evacuate most of the crew to Guam.

Security at US Capitol on high alert for Trump impeachment trial,"(CNN) The unprecedented second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump will take place under extraordinary security inside the US Capitol -- a physical reminder that federal officials still believe threats to lawmakers and federal buildings are possible more than a month after the January 6 insurrection.

Members of the National Guard still patrol the exterior of the Capitol complex -- in some cases along 8-foot, non-scalable fences topped by razor wire.

Within the halls of the building, all nine House Democratic impeachment managers are flanked by a security detail as they walk to votes and take meetings around the Capitol. The managers were also assigned a security detail during last year's impeachment trial.

In addition, enhanced security measures around the US Capitol will remain in place due to the ongoing potential for violence by domestic extremists, in part due to the heightened political tension surrounding the trial itself, sources familiar with the plans told CNN. Access to the Senate will also be tightly regulated, as it was during Trump's first impeachment trial.

Federal law enforcement officials say they are not currently tracking any ""specific and credible"" threats to the Capitol surrounding the Senate impeachment trial, which is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, but relevant agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, remain on high alert. They're using all the tools at their disposal to avoid the security and intelligence failures that occurred leading up to the January 6 Capitol attack.

The FBI continues to conduct surveillance on a number of people in the US, in cases where there is enough probable cause to do so -- monitoring for any signs that they are planning something specific around the impeachment trial and in the weeks that follow, according to a law enforcement official.

Law enforcement officials have also reached out to some of the suspects in an effort to discourage them from facilitating unrest or violence, the official said.

As part of that effort, officials are closely tracking threats against individual members of Congress, which have continued to mount in recent weeks. Ensuring the safety of lawmakers in Washington and as they travel back to their home states has become a particular area of focus, sources have told CNN.

Security precautions in place

Multiple congressional sources familiar with Capitol security operations told CNN that lawmakers have not been briefed on any imminent threats surrounding the impeachment trial but noted enhanced security precautions will be left in place out of an abundance of caution, and additional steps have been taken to protect lawmakers with prominent roles in the proceedings.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats last week that additional security has been provided for lawmakers when they are traveling.

""The Sergeant at Arms (SAA) and U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) are partnering with the Transportation Security Administration, Federal Air Marshal Service and Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority to increase security for Members while traveling to and from Washington,"" she wrote in a letter to members.

""Among other steps, USCP will be stationed at BWI, IAD, DCA and Union Station to provide extra security on days with increased Member travel,"" Pelosi added, using acronyms for the airports that serve DC. ""Given the serious and ongoing security threats facing Members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs.""

A TSA spokesperson declined to comment on what additional security measures would be afforded lawmakers while traveling to and from Washington.

Nationwide, detainment memos filed by federal prosecutors show officials are treating the threat of organized violence as not only possible, but also likely. Prosecutors are urging judges to consider the potential for similar events when deciding whether riot defendants should remain behind bars. Friday, Department of Justice attorneys argued that a Seattle member of the right-wing extremist group the Proud Boys should stay in custody.

""There is no reason to believe that Defendant, or any of his Proud Boy associates, are any more interested in 'complacency,' or any less interested in fomenting rebellion, than they were on January 5,"" prosecutors wrote. ""If nothing else, the events of January 6, 2021, have exposed the size and determination of right-wing fringe groups in the United States, and their willingness to place themselves and others in danger to further their political ideology. Releasing Defendant to rejoin their fold and plan their next attack poses a potentially catastrophic risk of danger to the community.""

The likelihood of planned gatherings or protests in the District throughout the week is minimal.

Michael Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, told CNN in an email that the agency was reviewing only two applications for permitted events in DC this week: one a free speech demonstration calling for Trump to be convicted and another to protest the political situation in Myanmar.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department said the agency hasn't issued any permits for events.

But law enforcement officials are acutely aware that extremists could be inspired by rhetoric from lawmakers or online narratives that emerge during the trial and in the weeks that follow.

Those concerns echo warnings issued by the Department of Homeland Security in a threat bulletin last month , which officials say reflects a clear shift in how the agency is prioritizing the issue of domestic extremism under President Joe Biden in a way the Trump administration did not.

""If you've been to the Capitol in the last three weeks it's like an armed fortress here. And so I'm not personally worried about my physical security here and about the security of the building and the institution right now,"" Rep. Elissa Slotkin, chair of the House Intelligence Counter Terrorism Subcommittee, told reporters last week when asked about concerns related to impeachment.

Another major event for US Capitol Police

This week also marks another major event for the US Capitol Police since the rally-turned-riot at the Capitol on January 6. In a YouTube video posted Friday, US Capitol Police acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said the department is working side by side with the National Guard during upcoming congressional events.

""We have taken steps to ensure the operational tempo and the posture of the department conforms with the available intelligence,"" Pittman said in the video.

US Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment regarding security around the impeachment trial.

The department approaches the trial with officers still nursing visible and invisible injuries. According to Pittman, 125 officers were assaulted during the riot, leaving 70 injured. She noted some officers within the department are still struggling. Sources within US Capitol Police told CNN that following the riot they are physically and mentally exhausted and worried that leadership is not equipped to usher the department through the heightened threat environment.

While several congressional sources agreed that they are not overwhelmingly concerned about threats specifically tied to the trial, there are varying opinions about how to address security around the Capitol and for lawmakers long term.

Federal and state officials have previously made clear that the increased security posture in the nation's capital will extend into March due to several concerns, including possible threats around the impeachment trial.

Capitol security officials are also looking at what the security posture should look like months after the trial, as Republicans and Democrats are already raising concerns about some of the precautions becoming permanent.

The final assessment made by retired Lt Gen. Russel Honore, a former Army commander who has been tasked with conducting an independent review of security measures around the Capitol, will be factored into that decision, according to Pelosi, who has largely deflected when asked about changes to the Capitol security posture after the trial.

Asked about security around the impeachment trial, including additional protection for members and their families, a congressional aide echoed what Pelosi and her staff have said in recent weeks, telling CNN: ""Honore is looking into member security and will make recommendations about this that the House will review.""

""I will say it will be interesting to know what the plan is longer term,"" Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, said last week. ""You know, the Michigan National Guard is back participating in protecting the Capitol right now, our National Guardsmen will not be here and should not be here forever. These gates and fences should not be here forever. So do we have a security situation that's better than January 6, especially given the hell that the Capitol Police has gone through as an organization since then? That's definitely something I'm interested in.""

Slotkin also told reporters her committee will be focused on addressing the threat of domestic terrorism ""writ large, not just against the Capitol, which of course is symbolic and important, but also in our local communities."""
House Republicans who backed impeaching Trump have no regrets as Senate GOP reckons with former President's role,"(CNN) They've faced sharp backlash from former President Donald Trump and his supporters and been censured by their state parties, all the while facing new threats of primary challenges from the right.

""Hell no,"" Rep. John Katko of New York told CNN, when asked if he had any regrets for his vote to impeach Trump.

""In eight years in Congress, I probably had a hundred votes that I could have gone either way, and I maybe second-guessed a little bit,"" Rep. Tom Rice, the South Carolina Republican who was censured by his state party for his vote, said in an interview. ""This is not one of them.""

As the Senate gears up for his second impeachment trial starting Tuesday, Trump still remains a polarizing and dominant force in his party. The pro-Trump wing of the House Republican Conference is still the most sizable bloc, while a large contingent of top Senate Republicans are eager to move past the Trump-era and all the controversies that followed, even as they are likely to acquit him.

Over the weekend, Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House GOP leader who was censured by her state party for being just one of 10 House Republicans voting to impeach Trump, asserted that the GOP should "" not be embracing the former President .""

Some top Senate Republicans agree.

""I think our party has to be embracing solutions,"" Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, told CNN Monday when asked about Cheney's comments. ""I think if we want to speak to the issues that people in this country care about, the longer we're tied to a personality -- a cult of personality -- I just don't think that's a good durable model for the future. That's a debate we are going to be having among Republicans both here and around the country.""

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who may vote to convict Trump, said in a brief interview: ""I think we're in a place where Donald Trump is gone -- and in terms of his role in party, that has yet to be determined. But I have not embraced the party of Donald Trump. I'm looking for the Republican Party.""

Yet Trump allies like Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, have long argued that Trump's support is paramount to winning back the House and Senate in 2022, and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy made a trek to Trump's South Florida golf resort to make amends with the former President. In the Senate, so far just five GOP senators have indicated they could convict Trump in his impeachment trial -- far short of 17 Republicans who would at least be needed to reach the 67 votes to convict the former President and then later bar him from ever serving in office again.

Asked if backlash from the right is weighing on Republican senators as they decide how to vote, Texas Sen. John Cornyn said: ""I don't know if I'd say it weighs on us, but we're aware of that in the political context.""

Other GOP senators were cryptic when asked about Cheney's remarks.

After expressing his concerns about the constitutionality of the impeachment trial, GOP Sen. Roy Blunt was asked about Cheney's comments about the party not embracing Trump. Instead, he pointed to how the trial is not constitutional in his view.

""Well, embracing your view of the Constitution doesn't mean you're embracing any individual if that's your legitimate view,"" said Blunt, who is up for reelection next year in Missouri. ""It's my legitimate view and that's the only person I can speak for.""

Caught in the middle are a band of House Republicans who defied their party and stood up to Trump, voting to impeach him on a charge of inciting the deadly January 6 insurrection. Many are now facing the threats of Trump-inspired primary challengers following their vote to impeach.

Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington state Republican who also voted to impeach, when asked if she had any regrets about her impeachment vote, said, ""Heck no.""

""When push comes to shove, I'm gonna stand with the Constitution, which is why I actually I'm at peace with it,"" Herrera Beutler said. ""Because that's what I said I'd do in the first place.""

The congresswoman said she's ""not worried"" about a potential primary challenger

""There's a lot of Republicans who disagreed with me on it, and I totally respect that,"" Herrera Beutler said. ""They don't expect you to agree with them on everything, but they want to be able to trust you.""

Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, a freshman Republican, did not hesitate when asked if he regrets his impeachment vote, saying, ""Not for a second. Not for a second.""

""It was the right thing to do,"" Meijer said, adding that he had a town hall with constituents, some of whom expressed disappointment in the way he voted on impeachment. ""I regret that that is how they feel.""

Other GOP impeachment backers also echoed that sentiment, including Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Michigan Rep. Fred Upton and Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez -- all of whom defended their votes.

Jeffrey Epstein's US Virgin Island properties may be sold to help pay victims' fund,"(CNN) Representatives of Jeffrey Epstein's estate are looking to sell his US Virgin Island properties to fund the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program, which paused all payouts last week, according to an attorney for the estate.

Epstein maintained a home on Little St. James, which he acquired in 1998, and purchased nearby Great St. James in 2016, according to a lawsuit filed last year.

Dan Weiner, an attorney for the estate, told CNN in a written statement the co-executors of the estate received ""expressions of interest from numerous parties regarding the two USVI properties, and 2-3 bona fide offers to purchase them.""

The islands of Great St. James, bottom, and Little St. James are owned by the estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The islands are shown here in a July 2019 photo.

The proposed sale of the properties comes after program administrators for the victims' fund announced Friday they were pausing payouts because the estate was low on cash. Because of ""uncertainty"" over funding, the program said it is holding compensation determination offers until March 25 or later depending on when the estate can provide the necessary funds to finish payouts, according to a news release from the fund

""The Estate has found its way to pay for lawyers, landscaping, and helicopter fees, but not the brave women who have stepped forward to participate in the compensation fund,"" said US Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise N. George. ""It is, unconscionably, another promise made and broken by Epstein and now, his Estate."""
"February 8, 2021 Trump impeachment trial news","Rep. John Katko Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images/FILE

They’ve faced sharp backlash from former President Trump and his supporters and been censured by their state parties, all the while facing new threats of primary challenges from the right.

But the House Republicans who voted to impeach him are showing no signs of backing down and are signaling they'd do it again, the latest salvo in the battle over the party’s direction in the aftermath of Trump’s tumultuous tenure in the White House.

“Hell no,” Rep. John Katko of New York told CNN, when asked if he had any regrets for his vote to impeach Trump.

“In eight years in Congress, I probably had a hundred votes that I could have gone either way, and I maybe second-guessed a little bit,” Rep. Tom Rice, the South Carolina Republican who was censured by his state party for his vote, said in an interview. “This is not one of them.""

As the Senate gears up for his second impeachment trial starting Tuesday, Trump still remains a polarizing and dominant force in his party. The pro-Trump wing of the House GOP Conference is still the most sizable bloc, while a large contingent of top Senate Republicans are eager to move past the Trump-era and all the controversies that followed, even as they are likely to acquit him.

Over the weekend, Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House GOP leader who was censured by her state party for being just one of 10 House Republicans voting to impeach Trump, asserted that the GOP should “not be embracing the former President.”

Some top Senate Republicans agree.

“I think our party has to be embracing solutions,” Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Republican, told CNN Monday when asked about Cheney’s comments. “I think if we want to speak to the issues that people in this country care about, the longer we're tied to a personality, a cult of personality, I just don't think that's a good durable model for the future. That's a debate we are going to be having among Republicans both here and around the country.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who may vote to convict Trump, said in a brief interview, ""I think we're in a place where Donald Trump is gone — and in terms of his role in party, that has yet to be determined. But I have not embraced the party of Donald Trump. I'm looking for the Republican Party.”

Yet Trump allies like Sen. Lindsey Graham have long argued that Trump’s support is paramount to winning back the House and Senate in 2022 – while House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy made a trek to Trump’s South Florida golf resort to make amends with the former President.

In the Senate, so far just five GOP senators have indicated they could convict Trump in his impeachment trial – but it’s far short of 17 Republicans who would at least be needed to reach the 67 votes to convict the former President and then later bar him from ever serving in office again.

Asked if backlash from the right is weighing on Republican senators as they decide how to vote, Texas Sen. John Cornyn said, “I don’t know if I’d say it weighs on us, but we’re aware of that in the political context.”

Other GOP senators were cryptic when asked about Cheney’s remarks.

After expressing his concerns about the constitutionality of the impeachment trial, GOP Sen. Roy Blunt was asked was asked about Cheney’s comments about the party not embracing Trump. Instead, he pointed to how the trial is not constitutional in his view.

“Well, embracing your view of the Constitution doesn't mean you're embracing any individual if that's your legitimate view,” said Blunt, who is up for reelection in Missouri, next year. “It’s my legitimate view and that's the only person I can speak for.”

Caught in the middle are a band of Republicans who defied their party and stood up to Trump, voting to impeach him on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection. Many are now facing the threats of Trump-inspired primary challengers following their vote to impeach.

Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington state Republican who also voted to impeach, said, “Heck no” when asked if she had any regrets about her impeachment vote.

“When push comes to shove, I'm gonna stand with the Constitution, which is why I actually I'm at peace with it,” Herrera Beutler said. “Because that's what I said I'd do in the first place.""

US considers Covid-19 testing requirement for domestic air travel,"(CNN) — The Biden administration is considering a rule that would require negative Covid-19 test results for domestic air travel , according to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

Buttigieg mentioned the possible testing requirement for air travelers within the United States in an interview Sunday with ""Axios on HBO.""

""There's an active conversation with the CDC right now,"" Buttigieg told Axios. ""What I can tell you is, it's going to be guided by data, by science, by medicine, and by the input of the people who are actually going to have to carry this out.""

Buttigieg underlined that the ""CDC is looking at all its options,"" in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday.

""What we know is that it's the appropriate measure for international travel, people traveling into the US given some of those considerations. You know I'd say the domestic picture is very different, but you know the CDC is always evaluating what can best be done to keep Americans safe,"" Buttigieg said.

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said on Monday that screening US travelers for Covid-19 could be helpful. But she did not expand upon whether there are plans to test domestic travelers.

""To the extent that we have available tests to be able to do testing, first and foremost, I would really encourage people to not travel,"" Walensky said during a White House briefing. ""But if we are traveling, this would be yet another mitigation measure to try and decrease the spread.""

When Buttigieg was asked if he supports the idea of requiring proof of a Covid-19 vaccination before air travel, he said that is up to the CDC.

""So, that's not a step that has been taken, and again, CDC is really in the lead on deciding what the right measures will be.""

Domestic vs. international testing

The discussion follows a CDC rule that went into effect at the end of January requiring negative Covid-19 tests for international travelers, US citizens and residents entering the United States.

The US Travel Association, a national nonprofit industry body, hailed that rule for inbound travelers as ""key to reopening international travel.""

However, the group does not support a testing requirement for domestic air travelers.

The group called mandatory testing for domestic travelers ""impractical,"" noting that there aren't defined ports of entry and that such a measure could ""divert scarce public health resources away from other priorities.""

Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian called mandatory testing for domestic travelers ""a horrible idea,"" citing few documented cases of Covid transmission aboard airliners and concerns that testing for air travelers would take testing resources away from areas of greater need.

""It will not keep domestic fliers safer,"" Bastian told CNN's Poppy Harlow. ""If anything, it's going to keep people away from what they need to do in terms of starting to get back out for not just essential travel, but people need to start reclaiming their lives.""

He said it would be a ""logistical nightmare"" that would delay the recovery of the whole hospitality sector.

Other groups raise concerns

Industry body Airlines for America has also expressed concern about the possible testing requirement for domestic air travel.

In a recent letter to the White House, the organization highlighted the risk-based measures to stemming Covid-19 transmission that the industry has adopted and research showing that the risk of in-flight infection is low.

""Given the strong scientific evidence that the risk of Covid-19 transmission onboard an aircraft is very low, we believe that a testing requirement for domestic air travel is unwarranted,"" the letter reads.

""Further, public health and economic data indicate that this policy would disproportionately prevent low-income travelers and rural Americans in small communities from travel.""

A4A also echoed the US Travel Association's concern that such testing would divert resources away from more urgent public health priorities.

Airplane manufacturer Boeing is also opposed to mandating testing for domestic air travelers and said the federal government should pay for tests if the requirement is adopted.

""Imposing such a burden on the already financially beleaguered airline industry has the potential for severe unintended consequences that will ripple across the entire economy,"" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stanley Deal and Boeing Chief Aerospace Safety Officer Michael Delaney in a letter to the White House Covid-19 Recovery Team."
"Someone tried to poison a Florida city by hacking into the water treatment system, sheriff says","(CNN) A hacker gained access into the water treatment system of Oldsmar, Florida, on Friday and tried to increase the levels of sodium hydroxide -- commonly referred to as lye -- in the city's water, officials said, putting thousands at risk of being poisoned.

The incident took place Friday when an operator noticed the intrusion and watched the hacker access the system remotely. The hacker adjusted the level of sodium hydroxide to more than 100 times its normal levels, according to Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri.

The operator immediately reduced the level back. At no time was there a significant adverse effect to the city's water supply, and the public was never in danger, Gualtieri said. It is unknown if the breach happened from someone locally, nationally or even outside of the United States.

""This is somebody who is trying, as it appears on the surface, to do something bad. It's a bad act. It's a bad actor,"" Gualtieri said. ""This isn't just 'Oh, we're putting a little bit of chlorine or a little bit of fluoride, or a little bit of something,' we're basically talking about lye that you are taking from 100 parts per million to 11,100.""

Early intervention prevented the attack from having more serious consequences, said Robert M. Lee, the CEO of Dragos Inc., an industrial cybersecurity company. But, he said, this type of attack is precisely what keeps industry experts awake at night.

"Paul Manafort can't be prosecuted on state charges, New York court rules","(CNN) The New York state appeals court denied the Manhattan district attorney's effort to bring criminal charges against Paul Manafort after he was pardoned by then-President Donald Trump.

In a brief ruling , the chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals denied Cyrus Vance's application to have the appeal re-argued after a lower court threw out state charges against Manafort in 2019 on double jeopardy grounds.

Manafort pleaded guilty to undisclosed foreign lobbying and witness tampering conspiracies and was convicted at trial on federal tax fraud and bank fraud charges. On the day he was sentenced, the district attorney's office announced a 16-count indictment of state charges.

""As we have said from the time the district attorney announced charges against Mr. Manafort, this is a case that should never have been brought because the dismissed indictment is a clear violation of New York law,"" said Todd Blanche, Manafort's attorney. ""As the trial court held, and the Appellate Division affirmed, the people's arguments 'all far short' of triggering an exception to double jeopardy that would justify this prosecution.""

A spokesman for Vance declined to comment.

Fact check: How Trump's lawyers twisted the facts in their anti-impeachment filing,"Washington (CNN) In a new legal filing , lawyers for former President Donald Trump accused the House Democrats who are leading Trump's impeachment trial of playing ""shamefully fast and loose with the truth.""

But at various points in their 75-page trial memorandum, Trump's lawyers themselves twisted or omitted critical facts.

The lawyers -- Bruce L. Castor, Jr., David Schoen and Michael T. van der Veen -- made a series of constitutional arguments in the memorandum. Most notably, they argued that the Constitution does not allow the Senate to hold an impeachment trial of a former president. They also argued that it is unconstitutional to impeach Trump over ""political speech"" they say is protected by the First Amendment.

Many legal experts say that both of these arguments are wrong. In this article, though, we'll set the constitutional debate aside. Our focus is the part of the memorandum in which the lawyers tried to defend Trump's actual conduct.

Trump's use of the word ""fight""

Trump's lawyers wrote that, of over 10,000 words in Trump's speech at The Ellipse park near the White House on the day of the insurrection, ""Mr. Trump used the word 'fight' a little more than a handful of times and each time in the figurative sense that has long been accepted in public discourse when urging people to stand and use their voices to be heard on matters important to them; it was not and could not be construed to encourage acts of violence.""

Facts First: Trump used the word ""fight"" or its variants 20 times in his January 6 : Trump used the word ""fight"" or its variants 20 times in his January 6 speech

There's no firm definition of ""handful,"" so we can't definitively declare the claim false, but 20 times is a lot. And while we'll leave it up to others to determine how literal or figurative Trump was, some of the 20 references were quite pointed.

Near the end of the speech, Trump said, ""And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.""

Early in the speech, he said, ""Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder. And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't, that will be a -- a sad day for our country, because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution.""

Trump was talking about his desire for Pence to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's electoral votes -- which Pence never actually had the power to do.

The insurrection timeline

Trump's lawyers claimed that ""a simple timeline of events demonstrates conclusively that the riots were not inspired by the President's speech at the Ellipse."" The lawyers cited an article that noted the park is 1.6 miles away from the Capitol and that barriers around the Capitol were first breached before Trump had even finished speaking.

Facts First: Because rioters were still present at the Capitol more than three hours after Trump concluded the speech, people had : Because rioters were still present at the Capitol more than three hours after Trump concluded the speech, people had more than enough time to attend Trump's speech at the park and then storm the Capitol; the FBI alleges that some participants did make this walk , including one who allegedly went from the Trump speech to her hotel and then into the Capitol. It is true that the timeline shows that someone who attended the entirety of the speech at the park could not have been among the very first people to breach the Capitol grounds, but that's a narrower claim than the one Trump's lawyers are making.

And all of this ignores the fact that insurrectionists near the Capitol could have listened to Trump's speech on their phones or could have been inspired by Trump's previous rhetoric.

Who breached the Capitol and why

Trump's lawyers argued, ""The real truth is that the people who criminally breached the Capitol did so of their own accord and for their own reasons, and they are being criminally prosecuted.""

The lawyers linked, in a footnote, to an article in The Gateway Pundit, a right-wing website that is known for promoting false conspiracy theories and that had its account banned from Twitter this weekend. The article began by claiming that ""anti-Trump groups primarily perpetrated [the] insurrection on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6."" The lawyers' footnote said of the insurrectionists: ""Some anti-Trump, some anti-government.""

Facts First: This is inaccurate by omission. Numerous participants in the insurrection are alleged in court documents to have : This is inaccurate by omission. Numerous participants in the insurrection are alleged in court documents to have told the FBI their actions were motivated by their support for Trump -- and some have even said they felt they had been directly instructed by Trump to take action. The list of people charged over the insurrection includes both pro-Trump alleged members of right-wing extremist groups and Trump supporters unaffiliated with formal groups.

While the ideology of some alleged participants can be hard to pinpoint , there is no basis for the suggestion that the insurrection was primarily perpetrated by Trump opponents.

Trump's video during the insurrection

Trump's lawyers noted that during the insurrection, Trump ""told rioters to go home."" In a footnote on the same page, the lawyers elaborated that ""upon hearing of the reports of violence,"" Trump tweeted a video ""urging people to 'go home' and to do so in 'peace.'""

Facts First: These statements omit key context. In the same : These statements omit key context. In the same video in which Trump urged rioters to ""go home in peace,"" he continued to lie that the election was ""stolen from us"" and that it was a ""fraudulent election."" (And he told the rioters that ""we love you"" and that ""you're very special."") In addition, Trump did not tweet the video until 4:17 PM Eastern , about two hours after the rioters forced their way into the Capitol and more than three hours after barricades outside the building were first breached. Also, CNN and other media outlets have reported that Trump had to be lobbied by allies to release the video.

And in a tweet nearly two hours after the video, which was quickly deleted by Twitter, Trump seemed to offer a rationalization for the violence while also repeating his lie about the election result: ""These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!""

Trump's reaction to the violence

Trump's lawyers rejected media reports about the former President's reaction to the riot. ""There is no legitimate proof, nor can there ever be, that President Trump was 'delighted' by the events at the Capitol. He, like the rest of the Country, was horrified at the violence,"" they wrote.

Facts First: This is disputed. Multiple media outlets reported in January that Trump was not horrified by the riot as he watched it unfold on television.

CNN reported : ""White House staffers were visibly shaken by Trump's response to the mob breaching Capitol Hill. The President was borderline enthusiastic over the protests and did not want to condemn them, multiple people said."" The New York Times reported : ""As supporters stormed into the Capitol on Wednesday, Mr. Trump was initially pleased, officials said, and disregarded aides pleading with him to intercede."" And The Washington Post reported : ""Though not necessarily enjoying himself, he was 'bemused' by the spectacle because he thought his supporters were literally fighting for him, according to a close adviser. But, this person said, he was turned off by what he considered the 'low-class' spectacle of people in ragtag costumes rummaging through the Capitol.""

Trump's behind-the-scenes actions

Trump's lawyers said of the former President: ""He and the White House further took immediate steps to coordinate with authorities to provide whatever was necessary to counteract the rioters."""
Blinken says Capitol insurrection hurt US standing as defender of democracy,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the insurrection attempt on the Capitol by President Donald Trump's followers has hurt the United States' ability to speak up for democracy and human rights, though he remains optimistic about American institutions.

""There's no doubt that our ability to speak with that, that, that strong voice for democracy and human rights, took a hit with what happened on January 6,"" Blinken said on ""The Situation Room."" ""But I gotta tell you, I actually see the glass as half full on that because we had a peaceful transition of power pursuant to our Constitution.""

Blinken spoke to CNN a day before the Senate convenes for Trump's impeachment trial . The House voted to impeach the former president on January 13 on one charge of inciting an insurrection. The historic vote came a week before Trump left office, making him the only president in American history to be impeached twice.

Re-engaging

While Trump is gone from office, the impact on US standing in the world continues to reverberate. Russia and China have mocked the US for the events of January 6, which shocked allies. Blinken said the US response is one of the things that makes it unique.

""We've had incredibly challenging moments and sometimes we've taken our own steps backwards. But what's made us different is our willingness our ability to confront these challenges with full transparency in front of the entire world,"" the top US diplomat said.

""Sometimes it's incredibly difficult, sometimes it's ugly, but I think we have a very strong story to tell about the resilience of democracy, the resilience of our institutions and the determination of this country to always try to form a more perfect union,"" he added.

Blinken reiterated President Joe Biden's commitment to alliances and reaffirming US leadership after President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policy often left the US isolated and at odds with allies.

""Part one is showing up, re-engage,"" Blinken said. ""None of the big problems we face ... not a single on can be addressed by any single country acting alone,"" Blinken said, pointing to climate change, weapons of mass destruction. That means ""a premium on diplomacy.""

Russia and Iran

Blinken said the US is relying on its close alliances to determine how to approach Russia as well, and hinted that the administration will work with Congress to take action with regard to the poisoning of Alexey Navalny . The opposition leader returned to Russia after recovering in Germany, five months after his near-brush with death. Navalny's arrest shortly after his return and his subsequent jailing has prompted widespread protests across Russia.

""It seems apparent that a chemical weapon was used to try to kill Mr. Navalny,"" Blinken said. ""That violates the Chemical Weapons Convention and other obligations that Russia has.""

Such a move would also violate US sanctions that Congress has imposed on Russia,"" he added. ""We're reviewing that, we're looking at that very carefully, and when we have the results, we'll take action.""

Blinken also repeated the administration's determination that Iran should make the first move in negotiations over the US return to the international nuclear agreement. ""If Iran returns to compliance ... we would do the same thing,"" Blinken said, and use the pact as a starting point to form a ""longer and stronger agreement"" that includes other matters, including Iran's missile program.

Blinken said Trump had the right idea to take a ""a tougher approach to China,"" but then added, ""the way he went about it was wrong across the board."" Blinken said the US has to approach China from a position of strength. ""That means having strong alliances.. not denigrating our alliances,"" he said."

Black Lives Matter ad condemns White supremacy ahead of Trump impeachment trial,"(CNN) A new Black Lives Matter ad is calling for an end to White supremacy using footage of the January 6 Capitol riots and historic Ku Klux Klan rallies to pressure lawmakers to impeach and convict former President Donald Trump.

The ad, released exclusively to CNN, comes as the Senate prepares to begin its second impeachment trial of Trump on Tuesday.

Black Lives Matter organizers blamed Trump for inciting the Capitol insurrection and emboldening White supremacists with offensive rhetoric and divisive policies throughout his presidency.

The ad shows harrowing clips of Trump supporters breaking glass windows at the Capitol and standing on the dais in the Senate chamber, and a noose that was erected on a wooden beam in front of the Capitol that day.

""You felt a fraction of what Black Americans have felt for more than 400 years,"" the narrator of the ad says.

Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, said convicting Trump would send a message that Congress condemns racism and wants to root out white supremacy.

""The ad is really about holding both Trump accountable as well as all of those who advocate for and behave as white supremacists accountable,"" Abdullah told CNN. ""So we are asking members of Congress to take action to make sure Trump is actually convicted and barred from future office as well as looking at members of Congress and all elected officials who engaged in his heinous act.""

The ad promotes a Black Lives Matter petition that not only demands Trump's conviction but calls for the removal of Republican lawmakers who encouraged the Capitol mob's attempt to overturn the election.

The ad specifically targets Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, showing a clip of him saying ""the election was rigged"" -- a false claim spread by Trump after he lost to President Joe Biden.

In many instances, Trump accused majority Black cities of voter fraud last year.

The petition also demands an investigation into ties between White supremacists and Capitol police, for digital media to permanently ban Trump from all platforms, the defunding of police, and for lawmakers to pass the BREATHE Act, which calls for divestment of police and reinvestment into housing, education, health, and environmental justice for communities of color.

Abdullah said while Black Lives Matter is encouraged by Biden's pledge for equity , the organization wants to see policy change.

""It's important to also remember that those four years that Donald Trump was in office, he wreaked havoc,"" Abdullah said. ""And so there are policies that have to be undone and I'm glad to see them beginning to be addressed.""

The ad is also being released days after the Black Lives Matter movement was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Norwegian MP Petter Eide nominated the global movement ""for their struggle against racism and racially motivated violence,"" he wrote in his official nomination papers.

The nomination has already been blasted by critics who say Black Lives Matter is undeserving because it inspired demonstrators to burn buildings and loot businesses last summer. However, a study by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) found that 93% of Black Lives Matter protests last summer were peaceful. Counterprotesters, agitators, White supremacists and other people not affiliated with Black Lives Matter were responsible for much of the violence that did occur.

Abdullah said Black Lives Matter is grateful for the nomination and its key mission is to advance justice and freedom. Last summer's ongoing protests were necessary to shed light on the police violence against Black people.

""There are Black Lives Matter formally organized protests and there is the righteous rage of folks who have been oppressed,"" she said. ""Until there is justice, you cannot ask oppressed people to behave in the way that the state wants them to."""

"Covid-19 antigen tests not counted among cases in some states, CNN analysis shows","(CNN) Antigen test results still are not included in the total count of Covid-19 cases for some states -- not even as probable cases, as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends.

Five states -- California, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri and Nevada -- publicly report only cases confirmed with PCR tests in their online tallies, according to a CNN analysis of health department dashboards across all 50 states.

Some states only report polymerase chain reaction test results in their Covid-19 case numbers and exclude antigen test results since antigen tests are generally seen as less accurate. But as antigen testing ramps up in the United States, this exclusion could lead to potential miscounts.

""Antigen tests are relatively inexpensive, and most can be used at the point of care. Most of the currently authorized tests return results in approximately 15 minutes,"" according to the US Food and Drug Administration , but also notes it's generally less sensitive than other types of tests.

In California, for instance, CNN was told that antigen Covid-19 test results are required to be reported to local health departments and to the California Department of Public Health. But publicly reported Covid-19 testing data only reflects results from diagnostic tests that detect the coronavirus's genetic material, such as PCR -- polymerase chain reaction -- tests.

CNN requested antigen testing data from the state's department of public health, but was told in an email that ""antigen test results are not being publicly reported statewide at this time.""

Across the four remaining states, the data they each shared with CNN represent about 10,000 positive Covid-19 antigen test results reported over just a small sampling of days in January.

If included in reported case counts, those positive antigen test results would increase Covid-19 cases reported by those states between 5% and 50% in that time, according to CNN's analysis.

In Maryland, 3,522 positive antigen tests were reported to the Maryland Department of Health between January 23 and January 29, the department told CNN in an email. That averages out to be about 503 positive antigen tests per day not included in the state's daily dashboard of cases.

In Nevada, 7,764 antigen tests total were reported to the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services between January 21 and 27, according to a document from the department's Office of Analytics. Among those tests, 623 were positive. In Nevada, state counts are based on ""molecular tests only,"" with the exception of the Nevada Department of Corrections, which uses the BinaxNOW antigen test among people who are currently incarcerated.

In Colorado, between January 25 and 31, there were 10,203 total antigen test encounters per day, 527 of those were positive, according to the Colorado State Emergency Operations Center. The department told CNN in an email that the seven-day average positivity for antigen tests in that past week was 5.17%.

In Missouri, during the week of January 10, a total of 50,113 antigen tests were reported to the Department of Health, according to data obtained by CNN. Among those tests, 5,285 were positive.

'We're going to see an underestimate'

Public health officials have noted that while antigen tests are usually faster and cheaper than typical PCR tests, antigen tests are ""more likely to miss"" an active Covid-19 infection compared to PCR testing. Due to this difference in accuracy, some states choose to only report Covid-19 cases confirmed with PCR testing.

JUST WATCHED Why this new rapid coronavirus test could be a game-changer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why this new rapid coronavirus test could be a game-changer 04:31

In June, at least 28 states were not following CDC recommendations to report antigen test results as ""probable"" cases in Covid-19 case counts. While the number is now much smaller, some experts worry that in the future, not publicly reporting ""probable"" cases could paint a skewed portrait of the true spread of disease for residents in a state.

""Antigen-based tests are not necessarily the majority of all the tests that are being performed everywhere and so it's unlikely that we're getting a dramatically wrong estimate, as of right now -- also because most states are reporting them. But there is the risk going forward,"" Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , told CNN last week.

""I think that more and more of these antigen based tests are being used,"" he said. ""So there's certainly a risk going forward that if these are not reported consistently, that we're going to see an underestimate of the number of Covid cases in the country, and particularly in those states that are not reporting them.""

More rapid antigen tests are expected in the United States as last week, the Biden administration announced that the Department of Defense and Department of Health and Human Services are working with Australian company Ellume to provide more of its fully at-home Covid-19 tests to the United States. The test is an over-the-counter, rapid self-test which detects SARS-CoV-2 antigen. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes Covid-19.

While antigen tests work by detecting a protein that is part of the novel coronavirus, PCR tests work by detecting genetic material of the virus called RNA.

JUST WATCHED These are the problems with Covid-19 testing accuracy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These are the problems with Covid-19 testing accuracy 02:36

For antigen tests, ""proteins are shorter lived in the body and so there can be more false negatives from these tests,"" Dr. Elizabeth McNally, director of the Center for Genetic Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, wrote in an email to CNN.

""Antigen tests are routinely used for detecting other viruses, and we know they also have false positives and false negatives,"" she added.

Because PCR tests are typically highly accurate, they do not need repeat testing.

For antigen tests, however, ""positive results are usually highly accurate, but false positives can happen, especially in areas where very few people have the virus,"" according to the US Food and Drug Administration . Negative results may need to be confirmed with a PCR test.

Since antigen tests are more likely to report false negative results than false positive results, ""the concern is more so that there might be people who have Covid who are missed by these antigen-based tests, but not that they're creating false positives,"" Dowdy said. He added that it is estimated antigen tests will be positive in about 80% to 90% of people who have Covid-19.

""So if what you're primarily tracking is the percent of your tests that are positive, then including the antigen-based tests creates a risk of underestimating the percent positive,"" Dowdy said. ""But if you're looking at the total number -- which is, in general, what more people are looking at -- then by excluding people who are testing positive, you basically have people who have confirmed Covid-19 who are not being counted.""

In some states, antigen test results may be included in total case counts as ""probable cases,"" but not included in the percent positivity of tests, which tracks the percentage of all coronavirus tests performed in a state that are actually positive.

For instance, in Hawaii, ""Antigen tests are counted as probable cases, rather than as confirmed cases,"" Brooks Baehr, a spokesperson for the Hawaii State Department of Health, told CNN in an email. But ""for testing percent positivity, antigen tests are not included in our tallies because we are lacking accurate counts of total number of antigen tests performed in our state.""

'The more testing we do the better'

""It seems strange"" to not include antigen test results in statewide counts of Covid-19 cases, Northwestern University's McNally said in her email.

In the tallies, ""combining PCR and antigen might improve sensitivity and specificity of testing, but overall the testing we have works reasonably well, so I don't think this is really necessary,"" McNally said. ""We know there are many more cases of Covid-19 than what is reported.""

The most important take-away, Dowdy said, is that Covid-19 testing needs to continue and remains an important tool in responding to the pandemic.

""The more testing we do the better,"" said Dowdy, of Johns Hopkins University.

""It's better for people to know if they have this disease or not,"" he said. ""It's also important for the public health agencies to know how many people have Covid-19 in a given place -- and so we should be trying to ramp up testing, both of PCR and of the antigen based tests, and making sure that we report those as completely as possible."""
"'QAnon Shaman' rioter will eat organic food, while most prisons and jails have reputation for serving food that is unhealthy","(CNN) As trays with bologna sandwiches and canned fruit are being served to millions of people in America's prisons and jails, US Capitol rioter and so-called ""QAnon Shaman"" Jacob Chansley is only eating organic food while he awaits trial.

Last week, a federal judge ordered that Chansley should be given organic food after several requests and an apparent hunger strike, claiming non-organic food was against his religion and sickened him. Chansley's demand and the subsequent judge's decision exuded privilege in a system that has a reputation of serving inmates bland and sometimes unsafe meals, advocates say.

""The fact that this man is given this kind of preference shows the double standard in the criminal justice system, and in the detention system,"" said Rev. Al Sharpton, an iconic civil rights activist and founder of the National Action Network.

Chansley, the man seen in photos dressed in horns, fur headdress and face paint inside the US Capitol during the January 6 riot , was first detained at the Federal Correctional Institution Phoenix in Arizona, where he had been fed organic food, according to court documents. When Chansley was moved to the nation's capital to face his charges, the DC Jail denied his request to eat only organic food because the jail's contracted food providers did not offer those type of meals.

Following the judge's order, Chansley was transferred last Thursday to William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center in Alexandria, Virginia. He was moved there after Aramark, one of the largest food service providers in the country and the contracted food service by the jail, said it could meet the court's requirements and provide organic food meals, said Amy Bertsch, spokeswoman with the Alexandria Sheriff's Office.

His attorneys have argued in court documents that he requires an organic diet because of his faith of Shamanism, an ideology that is ""centered on the belief in supernatural phenomenon such as the world of gods, demons, and ancestral spirits.""

DC District Court Judge Royce Lamberth decided the accommodations could be made for Chansley because he had been fed organic food in detention in Arizona, and arguments about his adherence to Shamanism were enough to also convince the judge.

""There is no doubt that Shamanism is a religion and that defendant requests a dietary accommodation based on that religion, Lamberth wrote explaining his decision.

The Department of Corrections didn't dispute that Shamanism is a religion.

The judge also explained that the ""defendant's willingness to go without food for more than a week is strong evidence of his sincerity in his religious beliefs.""

Sharpton, who has been arrested and in the custody of state and federal facilities more than 30 times after protesting injustices, said some prisons may respect an inmate's request especially if its a religious-based diet. But ""sometimes that's not likely.""

""In the state jails, you eat what they give you or you starve ... it is absolute punishment and punitive beyond the regardless for human rights and dignity,"" Sharpton said. ""In federal, they have different protocols, and they ask if you have any dietary or religious preferences.""

A look into federal prison food

William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center -- where former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and other high-profile defendants have been held before -- is not a federal prison.

But if convicted and sentenced, Chansley, who is a federal defendant, will likely be transferred to a BOP facility.

Inmates in federal custody are given a variety of breakfast items, including hot oatmeal, bread, jelly and fruit, according to a copy of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)'s 2020 national menu, which was shared with CNN. For lunch and dinner, there's a rotating five-week menu that includes beef or soy tacos, tuna salad or hummus and pepper steak or lentils, the menu says.

For the 2019 fiscal year's budget, the BOP estimated it will serve about 175 million meals to over 184,000 federal inmates. The BOP also estimated that over $401,000 would be dedicated for food services for the 122 institutions and other facilities. That's about 4% of the agency's budget for salaries and expenses appropriations.

Justin Long, a spokesman with the BOP, said fresh fruit and vegetables are served daily, and ""inmates have the option to select from a regular, heart healthy, or no flesh entree for every meal, including vegan-friendly options.""

""The quality of the food served to our inmate population is a priority of the Bureau of Prisons,"" Long said. He couldn't confirm whether the food served in BOP facilities is organic.

In recent years, vendors have been accused of providing adulterated food to BOP. Last year, two meat packing plant executives were sentenced to 46 and 42 months in prison after being accused of providing $1 million of adulterated meat, including whole cow hearts labeled as ""ground beef, "" to 32 BOP institutions, the report said.

Last month, the owners of a food company that supplied South Carolina prisons agreed to pay $250,000 after authorities claimed the company diluted spices that ""were substantially comprised of filler agent"" from 2011 to 2018, the Justice Department said in a news release.

""Contractors that are selected and paid by the government to supply food to inmates are expected to comply with contractual and other standards,"" said Kenneth R. Dieffenbach, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General Fraud Detection Office.

""When they provide adulterated products, as the defendants allegedly did here, the government is cheated and the health and safety of inmates are placed at risk.""

Black and brown people are served 'terrible food' daily, advocates say

The Alexandria Detention Center, where Chansley is being held while he awaits trial.

Leslie Soble, a research fellow at Impact Justice, a non-profit that advocates for criminal justice reform, said that feeding organic food to detainees at US correctional facilities is ""completely unheard of.""

""Millions of other incarcerated people, most often from Black and brown people from low income communities are being served terrible food day after day, year after year,"" said Soble, the lead author of ""Eating Behind Bars: Ending the Hidden Punishment of Food in Prison,"" a report exploring the quality and impact of food in America's prisons.

""Chansley is a glaring example of White privilege and racial injustice,"" she said, referring to his ability to get such food and also move facilities to do so.

The report, based on responses from nearly 500 formerly incarcerated people and family members, found that in many instances, the food served is not safe, is not appealing and has a low nutritional value.

""Someone told us that the only time that they would get chocolate milk was when the milk was spoiled,"" Soble, who has done extensive research on food served in prison, said.

About 75% of the respondents reported being served rotten or spoiled food while they were incarcerated, the report says, and numerous people who were assigned to work in their prison's kitchen said they were asked to serve chicken or beef from packages marked as ""not for human consumption.""

While most facilities require that meals include vegetables and fruits, Soble says, what is being served ranges from a spoonful of applesauce, chunks of canned fruits, and canned green beans. In most states, Soble estimates that prisons spend between $2.50 to $3 per person in meals per day.

When asked about the food served at the Alexandria jail, a spokesman for Aramark told CNN that all correctional facility menus are designed by ""registered dietitians to meet the nutritional requirements"" specified by each individual facility and the guidelines set by the American Correctional Association.

Sharpton said he believes that there should be a federal law to address the nutriment of inmates since not all people in jail are convicted of a crime.

Some just can't post bail yet, he said, and ""they are treated as less than human there's no consideration for their health. There's no consideration for their dietary preferences.""

""It should be a law in the United States that we do not incarcerate people and force them to eat food to survive on sustenance that is provided by the state that is contrary to whatever their health needs, religious needs or dietary preferences are,"" he said.

Soble has seen how the decision to grant Chansley's request for organic food has drawn criticism, and hopes it leads to more people questioning why having poor quality prison food has become a norm.

""Why is it acceptable to use food as punishment for people who are incarcerated?"" Soble said."
A mom built a simpler Covid-19 vaccine sign-up website for her state while on maternity leave,"(CNN) After her mother-in-law had difficulty signing up for a Covid-19 vaccine , a Massachusetts woman created a website to make it easier for her -- and she made it easier for everyone.

Olivia Adams built a website that pulls in vaccination appointments from across the state, including government sites as well as ones operated by private businesses. She called it macovidvaccines.com

The 28-year-old software developer from Arlington, Massachusetts, says she spent three weeks and about 40 hours building the website -- and she did it while on maternity leave caring for her 2-month-old son, she told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Monday.

""I thought I'd take a look and I was surprised at how decentralized everything was and how there are a thousand different websites to go to,"" Adams said. ""I thought, 'How can I put my software skills to use to make this better in my free time?'""

Free time usually happened when her newborn is sleeping, Adams said. She said her 2-year-old son is at day care, so she's lucky not to be caring for both during the day.

The inspiration came after listening to her mother-in-law, who had a tough time signing up for an appointment. Her mother-in-law is a dental hygienist who qualified for the first phase of vaccinations, she said.

""She had a little trouble figuring out where to go and how to get signed up,"" Adams said. ""She was able to do it, but it took a little while and then she had the same problem when she was able to sign her father up when he became eligible at the beginning of our phase two.""

Her family isn't alone in their vaccine sign-up struggles . People across the country, from senior citizens to others in the early vaccine phases, have faced with hours waiting on the phone and logging online to see no spots available.

Adams examined Massachusetts' online vaccine portal and realized she could make it better for everyone. She said she is used to making complicated software related to health care needs in her job as a lead member of the technical staff at Athenahealth , a health care technology company.

But, she's never created a website quite like this.

""This was my first time making a complicated website myself,"" she said. ""The hardest part about it is that every website that has availability information I have to kind of tell my computer how to read that website like a human. That's where all the man hours went in.""

The vaccine appointments are available at a number of sites, from those run by the state to those administered at grocery stores and pharmacies. Parsing all that information for each provider is where it got a bit time consuming, she said.

Adams has a script that runs every five minutes across about 20 different vaccine sites, she wrote in an email.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker was asked about Adams' vaccine website at a press conference on Friday. ""Send us her name, we'll talk to her,"" Baker said Friday.

Adams said she reached out to the state to talk about her website before the press conference, but she had not gotten a response after emailing them. On Monday, she tweeted that she received an email from the state's Coronavirus Command Center and will try to meet with them this week.

CNN reached out to the state for comment but has not heard back.

Olivia Adams created the website mostly when her newborn son was sleeping.

Adams said she never expected her website to take off in popularity like this. She sent the link around to friends and family and it spread from there.

For the people who wonder if Adams could work her code magic for other states needing vaccination sign-up help , Adams said she realizes there is a big need.

""On Friday I would have told you, absolutely not,"" she said. ""There's no way I have the time to do that, but now the support has just been overwhelming and there's clearly such a need. I already have people from other states emailing me asking if this can be done where they're at. I'd love to explore that and we'll just see how it goes.""

Adams encourages others who may have an idea to help to just try it, she wrote via email.

""I encourage anyone who thinks they have a half-baked idea to go full force and they'll be surprised how well it turns out,"" she wrote. ""I built it for everyone but I didn't think everyone would use it."""
Slovenia chimney climb: Janja Garnbret and Domen Škofic scale the world's tallest artificial multi-pitch route,"(CNN) Soaring 360 meters into the sky, the Trbovlje Power Station in Slovenia is home to Europe's tallest chimney.

Just the mere sight of it is enough to make most tremble at the knees but two Slovenian climbers saw it as a chance of a lifetime.

In October 2020, Janja Garnbret and Domen Škofic became the first people to free climb the chimney's new route which is now the tallest artificial multi-pitch route in the world.

The pair, who had just a rope to catch them if they fell, were successful on their second attempt after over seven hours of climbing.

""It's definitely the most special thing I've done in my climbing career. It is climbing, but it's a combination of just about everything I experienced before, just combined in one thing,"" Škofic told CNN Sport.

Both climbers are world-class in their own right.

Škofic, 26, was a climbing prodigy and won the Lead Climbing World Cup title in 2016; Garnbret is quite simply one of the most talented sport climbers on the planet.

The 21-year-old has won multiple world championships and World Cup titles and is one of the favorites to win gold when climbing eventually makes its debut at the Tokyo Olympics.

Despite their expertize, the challenge was still way out of their comfort zone, with both more accustomed to indoor climbing where the wall is usually no more than 30 meters high.

This route, however, contained 13 pitches (or sections) and involved rope techniques that are very different from what they are normally used to.

The chimney itself was built in 1976 and used to emit emissions out of the valley where it's situated. It's been nonoperational since 2014.

Janja Garnbret and Domen Škofic celebrate their ascent on top of the Trbovlje Chimney.

'Not in my comfort zone'

But the new route, specifically designed over the course of five years, provided a real endurance test for the two climbers.

""It definitely helps you grow as a person,"" Garnbret told CNN Sport. ""You get a new perspective on climbing and you just get a different feeling, like something I've never done before.

""It really helps because I'm a person who is always looking for a challenge, who always wants to do something new, to do something better.

""So this is definitely a cool project and it was not in my comfort zone. I had to step out and just enjoy the whole process.""

Their first attempt took nearly 12 hours and both climbers fell on a number of pitches. Carrying heavy backpacks left them physically exhausted and they realized they hadn't brought sufficient food and drinks to sustain them.

Undeterred, the pair regrouped and went again four days later, successfully scaling the chimney in seven hours and 32 minutes.

Reaching the top after such a grueling climb is a feeling that neither will forget in a hurry.

""When I think back now, I remember how uncomfortable it felt, how it was hot, it was cold, it was windy, it was everything,"" Garnbret added.

""I also said one time that I never want to go again, that this was my last try and I never want to go again. But it was a super amazing experience and yeah, I was really happy when I came on the top.""

The route took five years to plan and build.

'I was more scared looking up'

Although heights come with the territory for climbers, neither had ever experienced such a vertical before.

Škofic still remembers the stomach-churning feeling of standing at the foot of the chimney, looking up as the top disappeared into the clouds.

""I was more scared looking up, watching the chimney. I mean, I had huge respect,"" he said.

""But when I was on the wall, I kind of fell into the climbing so much that I basically forgot about the heights.""

In addition to being an exhausting physical challenge, both agreed that it tested their mental capacity just as much.

Their very safety was dependent on maintaining focus for hours on end and every mistake counts when you're dangling on a climb like this.

Garnbret, who was also comfortable with the dizzying heights, initially struggled with the technique of falling off such a surface.

Indoor walls tend to have a slight overhang which prevents climbers from smashing into the wall when they fall off but the chimney didn't provide such luxury.

""The chimney had the same angle for three hundred and sixty meters. It was almost vertical,"" she said.

""So when you fell, you fell hard into the wall. So it's something different [...] I had to get used to the falling to just keep this out of my mind. Like to not be scared to fall.""

After reflecting on the achievement, neither has ruled out tackling a similar challenge in the future.

Until then, both are excited about the possibility of climbing competitions returning after the pandemic and Garnbret has her eyes firmly focused on the Olympics."
Trump tells aides he thinks he'll be acquitted as he remains fixated on 'accountability' for GOP lawmakers who voted to impeach,"(CNN) Former President Donald Trump has been reaching out to aides and advisers to discuss his upcoming Senate impeachment trial, sources familiar with the conversations said, with one of those sources saying Trump thinks there won't be enough Republican senators who'll vote to convict him.

Trump's second impeachment trial is set to begin on Tuesday. The House voted to impeach him on January 13 on one charge of inciting an insurrection. The historic vote came one week before Trump left office, making him the only president in American history to be impeached twice.

Since leaving office, Trump has been fixated on punishing GOP lawmakers who voted to impeach him in the House, including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming. Ten Republicans, including Cheney, voted to impeach Trump.

One Trump adviser said the ex-President is seeking what he sees as ""accountability"" for Republican House members who turned ""against the people."" The adviser acknowledged that was a twisted view of reality as Trump was the one who was actively attempting to overturn the will of the voters.

A major focus of the upcoming trial will be the speech Trump gave on the morning of January 6 on the Ellipse just south of the White House at a ""Stop the Steal"" rally meant to protest Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election. That rally was followed by thousands of Trump supporters storming the US Capitol in an insurrection that killed five people, including one Capitol Police officer.

Georgia secretary of state's office launches investigation into Trump's phone call,"(CNN) The office of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger confirmed to CNN on Monday that it has started an investigation into former President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the state's election results, including a phone call the former President made to Raffensperger.

During the call, Trump pushed Raffensperger to ""find"" votes to overturn the election results after his loss to then-President-elect Joe Biden, according to an audio recording first released by The Washington Post and later obtained by CNN.

""All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,"" Trump had said.

Raffensperger was adamant in defending the results of the presidential election as well as the integrity of the state's voting system. During the stunning one-hour call, Trump lambasted his fellow Republican for refusing to falsely say that he won the election in Georgia -- and repeatedly touted baseless claims of election fraud.

There have been no credible allegations of any issues with voting that would have impacted the election, as affirmed by dozens of judges, governors, election officials, the Electoral College, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Supreme Court.

Walter Jones, a spokesperson for Raffensperger, told CNN in a written statement that ""the Secretary of State's office investigates complaints it receives. The investigations are fact-finding and administrative in nature. Any further legal efforts will be left to the Attorney General."" Reuters was first to report on the investigation.

The announcement of the investigation comes as arguments are set to get underway Tuesday in Trump's historic second impeachment trial, in which he is facing a single charge of inciting an insurrection after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6. The insurrection -- in which five people died, including US Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick -- was an attempt by thousands of Trump supporters to interfere with Congress counting the electoral votes confirming Biden's win and was the zenith of months of Trump promoting conspiracy theories and lies that the election was stolen from him. The House impeachment managers are planning to use the call with Raffensperger and the months-long campaign to overturn Biden's win as part of their case during the trial.

A Georgia prosecutor's office is taking the extraordinary January 2 phone call between Trump and Raffensperger ""seriously as far as a potential case,"" as it weighs whether to pursue criminal charges of election fraud against the former President, a source familiar with the office said.

Newly elected Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is expected to make some type of announcement on the matter ""one way or another"" this month, the source said.

CNN previously reported that Willis said in a statement that she will enforce the law ""without fear"" and that her office was evaluating whether to pursue potential criminal action against Trump.

""Once the investigation is complete, this matter, like all matters, will be handled by our office based on the facts and the law,"" Willis said at the time.

David Worley, the only Democrat on Georgia's five-member State Election Board, told CNN in a statement, ""I requested that the Sec. of State open an investigation, now that has been done I will wait to get the report before requesting further action.""

District attorney also has jurisdiction

Worley had earlier told CNN that he planned to ask the State Board of Elections to refer the case to Willis and her office. The Georgia Constitution gives the Fulton County district attorney the jurisdiction to bring charges for any felony that occurs in the county, so Willis and her office have the power within the law to do whatever they felt was appropriate, regardless of the secretary of state's investigation.

One former federal prosecutor told CNN it's clear the state can make a case against Trump.

Michael J. Moore, the former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia between 2010 and 2015 under President Barack Obama, said the Georgia statute that deals with election fraud shows that it is ""pretty clear"" that the former President committed election fraud during his phone call with Raffensperger.

""If you if you listen to the call, it sounds like any other call that you might have with an organized crime ring or a drug conspiracy ring or something. And that is that you've got almost code talking about -- this is what I need you to do, if you could just help me out here,"" Moore told CNN.

Moore said the way Trump pressured Raffensperger to help him find votes by implying the secretary of state had been involved in some type of wrongdoing was threatening.

""So you take note of things, you read the Georgia statue, and I think it amounts up to a request that the secretary come in, do something untoward or illegal to allow the election to be shifted in a way that was different than the will of the voters, and that would be an effort to commit election fraud,"" the former prosecutor said.

Moore also said that it's not unusual for state prosecutors to look at things happening in the federal courts, and in this case, it's possible that Willis can watch how the impeachment hearings play out and say she is satisfied with how justice on Trump's actions is being handled by Congress.

Former prosecutor says it's a question of intent

Bret Williams, a former prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, told CNN the crucial question will be Trump's intent when he repeatedly told Raffensperger and his staff that ""I only need 11,000 votes.""

""That's the first question: Was there a solicitation and an intent behind it? I think you can make a very persuasive argument that that was the case, and that was the purpose of the phone call,"" Williams told CNN.

""I do think that you can make an argument -- I suspect if it's charged the defense will -- that the President wasn't making a request, a solicitation of Raffensperger to commit any crime. He was expressing his view that a crime had been committed against him, ironically enough, is I think what he would argue,"" Williams added.

""It's my estimation here that there are arguments on both sides, and it would be a hard-fought situation, a hard-fought case and a difficult decision for a jury to make,"" he added.

There were 18 attempted calls from the White House to the Georgia Secretary of State's Office between the election and the January 2 phone call between Trump and Raffensperger, a Georgia state official confirmed to CNN.

More than a week before the infamous early January call, Trump also called a Georgia election investigator in the secretary of state's office who was leading an investigation into allegations of ballot fraud in Cobb County. In the late December call, Trump asked the investigator to ""find the fraud,"" saying that official would be a ""national hero,"" according to a source with direct knowledge of the call.

Raffensperger told the Washington Post he was not familiar with the specifics of what the President said in the conversation with his chief investigator, but said it was inappropriate for Trump to have tried to intervene in the case.

""That was an ongoing investigation,"" Raffensperger told the newspaper. ""I don't believe that an elected official should be involved in that process.""

"Disney California Adventure Park to bring back 1,000 workers in limited reopening","New York (CNN Business) Some Disney fans will finally have the chance to return to the California Adventure Park next month for a limited-time experience, about a year after the entertainment giant's theme parks closed because of the pandemic.

Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock announced the plan Monday in a letter to workers sent in honor of California Adventure's 20th anniversary.

Disney DIS is not yet permitted by the state to fully reopen all of the park's attractions, so the event won't be like typical visits to a theme park. Instead, the park will offer guests food and beverages, merchandise and ""carefully crafted entertainment experiences,"" Potrock said in the letter, which was reviewed by CNN Business.

With this initiative — as well as the recent restart of outdoor dining in Downtown Disney after California's stay-at-home order was lifted last month — around 1,000 Disney cast members will be able to return to work. Tens of thousands of the company's workers have been furloughed or laid off since last year because of the prolonged closure.

""With limited capacity and enhanced health and safety measures in place, Guests once again will get to step into a magical Disney environment — an environment that will provide memorable and fun experiences our guests are craving,"" Potrock said."
New York certifies Claudia Tenney's victory in last unresolved House race of 2020,"(CNN) Three months after Election Day, the New York State Board of Elections on Monday certified Republican Claudia Tenney as the winner in New York's 22nd Congressional District, bringing the last unresolved House race to an end.

After the certification, Democrat Anthony Brindisi, who held the seat for the last two years, conceded.

""Today I congratulated Claudia Tenney and offered to make the transition process as smooth as possible on behalf of our community,"" Brindisi said in a statement. ""It is time to close the book on this election and focus on building a better community and more united Country for our children.""

The certification came after a Friday court order that put Tenney 109 votes ahead of Brindisi, after months of wrangling over the vote count.

""I'm honored to have won this race,"" she said in a statement posted to Twitter on Friday. ""It was a hard-fought-campaign and I thank Anthony Brindisi for his service.""

Grandfather sentenced in 2019 death of his granddaughter from a cruise ship window,"(CNN) The man who pleaded guilty in the death of his 18-month-old granddaughter aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship in 2019 was sentenced Monday to three years of probation, according to a statement from the Puerto Rican government.

Salvatore ""Sam"" Anello will serve his sentence in Michigan, where he lives, the government said.

In a statement after the sentencing, Anello said he agreed to plead guilty so he and the girl's family could focus on a civil case against the cruise line.

Anello was playing with his granddaughter, Chloe Wiegand, aboard the Freedom of the Seas cruise ship while it was docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on July 7, 2019. Anello ""negligently held a minor out an 11th floor window,"" the government statement said, and Chloe fell 115 feet to her death.

Anello was charged with negligent homicide months after the incident and initially pleaded not guilty, but he changed his plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, said attorney Michael Winkleman, who represents Chloe's family but does not represent Anello in his criminal case.

Pete Buttigieg quarantining after security agent tests positive,"(CNN) Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will quarantine for 14 days after a member of his security detail tested positive for Covid-19, department chief of staff Laura Schiller said in a statement.

Schiller's statement says the agent has been in ""close contact"" with Buttigieg as recently as Monday morning. Buttigieg tested negative Monday and has not shown any symptoms, the statement said.

Buttigieg has received his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, and Schiller said he will receive the second dose when he completes the quarantine period.

An additional member of the security team will also quarantine due to close contact with the agent.

Buttigieg told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday that both he and the agent who had tested positive felt fine.

US deploying B-1 bombers to Norway to send a message to Russia,"(CNN) The US Air Force is deploying B-1 bombers to Norway for the first time in a move that sends a clear message to Moscow that the US military will operate in the strategically important Arctic region and demonstrate that it will defend allies in the area against any Russian aggression close to the country's border.

Four US Air Force B-1 bombers and approximately 200 personnel from Dyess Air Force in Texas are being deployed to Orland Air Base in Norway, and within the next three weeks, missions will begin in the Arctic Circle and in international airspace off northwestern Russia, according to multiple defense officials.

Until now, military missions over the Arctic had been largely staged out of the United Kingdom. The movement of forces much closer to Russia means the US will be able to react more quickly to potential Russia aggression, officials say.

""Operational readiness and our ability to support allies and partners and respond with speed is critical to combined success,"" said Gen. Jeff Harrigian, commander of US Air Forces in Europe and Africa.

For the last several months, the Pentagon has operated similar groups of B-52 bombers in the Middle East as a means of demonstrating the ability of the US to quickly move military assets to potentially tense regions. These bombers missions take weeks to plan so the Norway deployment has been in the works for some time, officials say.

Two Sumatran tigers at an Indiana zoo test positive for Covid-19,"Two Sumatran tigers at the Fort Wayne Children’s Zoo in Indiana have tested positive for Covid-19, the zoo announced in a release.

Veterinarian staff received the tigers’ positive test results Friday, after care staff had reported one of the Sumatran tigers showing mild symptoms consistent with Covid-19 on Feb. 1, the release said.

“Bugara, the male Sumatran tiger, has been experiencing a dry cough, and Indah, the female Sumatran tiger, has not shown symptoms at this time” Dr. Kami Fox, the zoo’s staff veterinarian said. “Both tigers are being watched for any additional clinical signs and remain together in their enclosure.""

According to the zoo, the source of the tigers’ infection is still unknown and they are working with the Allen County Department of Health and the State Board of Animal Health to identify potential sources.

Among other extra precautions, the zoo is now restricting access to the tiger holding area and has increased PPE requirements for their care staff, in addition to following guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and recommendations by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Plan, the release said.

Evan Thomas Silva, 26, died Saturday after he was struck by shrapnel from the cannon, which was fired to ""celebrate the baby's pending arrival,"" Michigan State Police said in a statement.

When the cannon was fired by the homeowner, police said the cannon blew up, spraying metal shrapnel across the yard that struck Silva, three vehicles and the garage of the home in Gaines Township.

Silva was standing about 10 to 15 feet away from the cannon, and was the only person hit by shrapnel, police said. He was taken to a local hospital, where he died from his injuries.

""The cannon did not contain any projectiles, but it is suspected that the gun powder loaded into the device caused the cannon to fracture, resulting in shrapnel being spread in the area,"" according to the police statement.

Biden hopes Trump's impeachment won't derail agenda,"Washington (CNN) As his predecessor is tried in the US Capitol this week for inciting a deadly riot, President Joe Biden will work to keep his first-100-days agenda on track from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.

He'll virtually tour a vaccination center as the impeachment briefs are filed on Monday. He will pay his first visit to the Pentagon when the trial is underway. He's due at the National Institutes of Health later in the week. And he'll work the phones to garner support for his sweeping Covid-19 relief plan among mayors and governors -- a tacit recognition that Republican support in the preoccupied Senate may be increasingly elusive.

What he won't be doing, according to one official: watching much of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial on television. Unlike Trump himself, who spent hours watching his first impeachment trial from a flat-screen television in the presidential dining room, Biden has meetings and trips around Washington scheduled during the proceedings. And, officials have said, he's not much of a TV-watcher.

""The President himself would tell you that we keep him pretty busy, and he has a full schedule this week,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday, adding: ""I think it's clear from the schedule and from his intention he will not spend too much time watching the proceeding, if any time.""

Confronting Trump's role in the insurrection attempt last month was always set to consume at least part of Biden's opening days. With an acquittal all but certain, White House officials hope the trial moves quickly and doesn't distract from the urgent imperative of combating the coronavirus pandemic or confirming Biden's Cabinet nominees.

In the meantime, Biden will proceed as normal -- or as normal as can be for a president whose predecessor is on trial for inciting a riot in the hopes of clinging to power.

""His focus will be on getting the pandemic under control, engaging with civil servants who are at the heart and soul of government and engaging with a range of leaders to get the bill passed,"" a White House official said.

In a brief exchange with reporters Monday morning after returning to the White House from a weekend in Delaware, Biden again deferred to the Senate when asked about Trump's political fate.

""Look, he got an offer to come testify. He decided not to. We will let the Senate work it out,"" Biden said before jogging into the Oval Office, where he was due for a mid-morning intelligence briefing alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.

Covid-19 relief plan vs. impeachment

Biden has never had much of an appetite for a second impeachment trial, particularly one that interrupts the confirmation of his Cabinet nominees and delays the passage of his Covid-19 relief bill. But advisers say he reached the calculation weeks ago that trying to coax Democrats in the House away from impeaching Trump would not only be unsuccessful, it could also do something even more detrimental to his agenda: dividing his party.

""Trump is still the best thing for unifying Democrats,"" a senior adviser to Biden said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations. ""We can't get beyond this without having the Senate trial.""

With the House on recess for the next two weeks, Biden is trying to keep momentum alive for his $1.9 trillion economic package. He will continue to sell the plan, focusing on mayors and governors and business leaders, even as the Senate is conducting a trial.

The White House has worked closely with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the scheduling of the impeachment proceedings, urging him to keep things moving along as swiftly as possible. Still, the trial is all but certain to stretch into next week after one of Trump's lawyers asked for a halt to proceedings to observe the Sabbath on Friday evening and Saturday.

Advisers acknowledge the next two weeks in the nation's capital will almost certainly be dominated once again by Trump, but they believe outside Washington there will be an opening for the President and vice president to make their case on the need for the relief legislation.

For his part, advisers say, Biden has no intention to offer his assessment of whether Trump should be convicted. The President does not see it as necessary or productive to offer his personal view, fearing it could even further complicate his quest for unity.

""Look, I ran like hell to defeat him because I thought he was unfit to be president,"" Biden told CBS News in his interview that aired before the Super Bowl. ""I'm not in the Senate now. I'll let the Senate make that decision.""

For some of Biden's aides, it is not an unfamiliar sensation to have their boss crowded out by Trump. The underlying dynamic of last year's presidential campaign was largely one of Trump hogging attention through his politically damaging behavior while Biden proceeded with pandemic-altered events, content to largely cede the spotlight to his rival's self-destruction.

Now, however, the fate of Biden's debut legislative achievement and the underpinnings of his presidential agenda rest on not allowing Trump to distract from his work in office.

The impeachment trial, which will begin in earnest on Tuesday, interrupts what had been a steady pace of announcements and executive actions, each set to a daily theme, that Biden unveiled during his first weeks in office. The calendar had been arranged since well before he was inaugurated.

Counter-programming

Grounded from traveling because of the pandemic -- except for his trip home to Wilmington -- Biden will instead take a virtual tour on Monday afternoon of a vaccination site built inside State Farm Stadium in Arizona, which usually hosts the Arizona Cardinals and colelge football's Fiesta Bowl.

He's set to receive briefings at the Pentagon and NIH later in the week, likely during the hours the trial is underway. Federal health officials also planned to brief reporters and the White House proceeded ahead with its daily briefings, a signal that the impeachment trial would not impede business as usual.

AssSenators prepared to act as jurors in the impeachment trial, the other side of the Capitol was moving ahead with Covid-19 relief. House committees were marking up the legislation during sessions this week, aiming to finalize their legislative text by Friday.

The goal is for all the panels to pass their portions and send it to the Budget Committee by February 16, where the larger bill can be packaged together, passed and put on the floor the following week. Biden hopes for the bill to pass by mid-March, when federal unemployment benefits expire. Any delay caused by the impeachment trial could complicate the timeline, though officials have long insisted the Senate is capable of doing both at once.

""The Senate's going to do all three things next week. We're going to do our constitutional responsibility and hold a trial. It won't last very long. We are going to move forward nominees and we are going to continue to push forward Covid relief legislation. The Senate can do all of those things, and we will,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

A multi-day Senate impeachment trial has been a reality for the Biden administration since before it formally commenced, though the timing and parameters of the proceedings remained unclear in its earliest days.

White House officials had insisted it was up to the Senate to determine when the trial would take place, though Biden himself revealed off-the-cuff he would prefer some of his pressing business before the chamber be completed before it did.

""The more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises, the-- the better,"" he said two days after taking office."
The battle over schools reopening heats up. What are the facts?,"(CNN) As the Biden administration works to speed up the country's Covid-19 response, reopening schools has become one of the primary benchmarks of recovery. Across the country as vaccines are being administered to essential workers, often including teachers, calls for restarting in-person learning are growing more urgent.

Vaccine distribution, one of the key parts of getting schools to reopen safely, has been picking up recently , with the US averaging 1.3 million new shots per day last week, closing in on President Joe Biden's aim of 1.5 million per day. Still, it's early and a timeline for returning to in-person school remains a fierce topic of debate. While some states like Texas and Florida have ordered publicly-funded schools to be open, others like California and Illinois are locked in heated negotiations with teacher unions over the issue.

Republican lawmakers have renewed efforts to push schools to reopen. The House blocked immediate consideration last Tuesday of a Republican bill that would place new conditions on $54 billion in funds for K-12 schools passed by Congress in December, requiring schools to submit a plan to reopen in order to receive the majority of the money. Despite this setback, Republicans continue to call for schools to reopen.

""The evidence is clear: COVID-19 risk to kids in school is low,"" Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr tweeted last week. ""Meanwhile, the emotional cost to kids not having in-person learning is high.""

On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell advocated for reopening schools, calling remote learning a ""pale shadow of proper schooling,"" and added that ""all the science, all of it"" points to being able to send kids back to school.

While the issue is complex and depends on the challenges different school districts face, studies -- including ones from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- have shown that schools can safely reopen without creating outbreaks of the coronavirus if safety measures and precautions are followed. For some schools, like those in urban centers, ones held in older buildings and schools with large class sizes, the challenge of meeting those measures can be quite significant.

What the data shows

""There's a lot of science suggesting that many schools can open up safely,"" Harvard University epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch said, before noting that some are in better position than others.

""Vaccines are an element of this,"" Lipsitch added, though he was adamant that any vaccination plan to aid reopening schools should include not just teachers but other adults involved in the school's ecosystem.

While discussing the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and teachers being categorized as essential workers, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a briefing last week that ""there is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen"" and noted that ""vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite for safe reopening of schools.""

During a Friday press conference , Walensky said guidance for reopening schools would be issued this week. ""Our goal is to get children back to school. School should be the last places closed and the first places open. Our goal is to make sure in getting children back to school that we do so both with the safety of the children and the safety of the teachers,"" Walensky said.

Studies show encouraging data on schools reopening, with low rates of Covid-19 infections. In a study published January 26, several CDC researchers examined 17 schools in Wisconsin over the course of three months and found that the spread of the virus ""among students and staff members was lower than in the county overall."" Several safety measures were instituted at the school, including mandatory mask-wearing, limiting group sizes of 11 to 20 students, and social distancing whenever possible.

According to the study, only 3.7% of the documented cases of coronavirus among staff and students ""were linked to in-school transmission, and all seven were among children.""

One significant limitation of the study was that the schools observed were rural and the authors noted that physical distancing might be more challenging in urban and suburban schools.

This is not to say outbreaks at schools do not occur, but as an article published in JAMA last week noted, ""there has been little evidence that schools have contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.""

In order to prevent the transmission of Covid-19 in schools, the study recommended universal mask wearing, increased air ventilation in the schools, increased testing and ""using hybrid attendance models when needed to limit the total number of contacts and prevent crowding.""

Reopening schools

Experts say there's no perfect, cookie-cutter solution to safely reopen the 130,000 K-12 schools in the US. Safety measures depend on several factors including class sizes, as well as the average age of teachers and co-morbidities they may have and the age of the building and the ventilation of the school.

Mark Hernandez, who runs the Environmental Engineering Microbiology and Disinfection Lab at the University of Colorado and has worked with local schools to improve their ventilation systems, told CNN that ""the design and operation of school HVAC systems have a significant influence"" on students' exposure to the virus throughout the school day. ""But the reality is that many of our nation's schools do not have HVAC systems operating up to modern performance standards,"" added Hernandez.

Even if certain safety measures are followed, reopening schools is often not as simple as flipping a switch. In several states, for instance, local unions, school districts and governments are locked in substantial negotiations over restarting in-person learning.

During a press conference last Thursday, Lori Lightfoot, the Democratic mayor of Chicago, demanded the Chicago Teachers Union conclude negotiations and start in-person learning this week.

""Schools are safe,"" Lightfoot said, noting the city's $100 million investment to make Chicago schools safer from the virus included face coverings, ventilation and ""other in-school safety measures.""

The Chicago Teachers Union, however, wanted certain conditions met before returning in-person, like allowing school staff to be vaccinated, increased testing and a lower Covid positivity rate in the city.

A tentative deal was struck Sunday for schools in Chicago to reopen in phases starting later this week. On Twitter , the Chicago Teachers Union stressed that no agreement has been finalized and that members were still reviewing the framework of the deal.

Cost of reopening

Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, told CNN that ""public schools that especially serve our more marginalized students"" don't have the resources to implement the myriad of proposed safety measures.

""That's why we need the federal government to step up and do it now so that we can get about the business of reopening our school safely,"" Pringle said.

According to the American Federation of Teachers -- a national union with 1.7 million members -- facilitating a ""safe and effective reopening"" of public schools would require ""at least $116.5 billion "" in federal funding.

This figure includes safety measures like personal protective equipment as well as items like a 10 percent increase in ""instructional staffing"" and funds to provide students with a secure internet connection for students remote learning.

For his part, Biden is proposing $130 billion to help K-12 reopen as part of his $1.9 trillion stimulus package.

In December, the President set a goal for the majority of schools to reopen in his first 100 days in office. The goal was then paired down to include just Kindergarten through 8th grade.

It's unclear how feasible Biden's 100-day target is even as Democrats work to pass his stimulus plan through Congress.

If the government provides the necessary resources and funding, one expert said it would be tough but doable to make the changes needed to reopen safely. Hernandez, the University of Colorado engineering professor, said renovating ventilation systems in older schools across the nation in particular would be a challenge in that time frame.

""In our great country, could we get every school up to the most modern HVAC standards to significantly lower airborne exposure risks in the education environment? In 100 days? From an infrastructure perspective, that would be a tough one, but doable should our government and private sectors devote the resources and resolve to do so,"" Hernandez told CNN."
Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin exits governor's race in a sign of Trump-backed Huckabee Sanders' strength,"(CNN) Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin departed the 2022 governor's race Monday, opting instead to run for attorney general, in a move that signals former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders' strength just two weeks after she announced her campaign.

Griffin's exit underscores the hold former President Donald Trump, who quickly endorsed Huckabee Sanders' bid, continues to have on the Republican Party, even out of office and removed from his favorite social media platforms.

Just two weeks ago, Griffin told CNN in an interview that he planned to defeat Huckabee Sanders on ""substance"" and that he'd be ready for the job of governor on his first day in office -- ""and no one else is.""

""I think there's a lot to talk about other than personalities, and I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to talk a whole lot about ideas and substance. And at the end of the day, that's what makes the difference in Arkansans' lives,"" Griffin said then.

However, even out of office, Trump remains hugely influential in Republican politics. His quick endorsement of his former aide -- as well as Huckabee Sanders' standing as the daughter of a former governor -- led Republican operatives to believe she was the heavy favorite.

Facebook is trying to fix its anti-vaxxer problem. Again,"(CNN Business) After years of struggling to crack down on vaccine misinformation, Facebook is once again revising its policies to get tougher.

On Monday, the company announced several ways it plans to better combat vaccine misinformation, including making it harder to find accounts through searches on Facebook-owned Instagram that discourage people from getting vaccinated.

The announcement comes a day after CNN Business reported that Instagram continued to prominently feature anti-vaxxer accounts in its search results, while Facebook groups railing against vaccines remained easy to find. The findings raised concerns among public health experts, given the United States is in the midst of its largest vaccine rollout ever to address the coronavirus pandemic.

Facebook FB said Monday that it's ""expanding"" its efforts to remove false claims on its namesake platform and Instagram about the coronavirus, Covid-19 vaccines and vaccines in general during the pandemic.

The company also announced it will start showing links in its ""Covid-19 Information Center"" to local health websites to help users determine whether they are eligible to get the vaccine and how they can obtain one.

"'It's a miracle,' Dutch officials say as stowaway survives London to Holland flight in freezing temperatures","(CNN) A 16-year-old Kenyan boy has survived sub-zero temperatures on an hour-long flight from London to the Netherlands by hiding himself near the plane's landing gear.

Dutch police are investigating the possibility of human trafficking after finding the boy falling from a compartment in an aircraft at Maastricht Aachen airport in Limburg on Thursday.

""For us, it is a miracle,"" a spokesperson for the Dutch police said. ""Usually when someone stows away like this, they die because of the cold or a lack of oxygen,"" said Marvin Engh, a spokesman for the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, one of the national police forces in the country.

The stowaway was taken to a hospital with hypothermia but has since made a full recovery, police said.

He started his journey in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, and went from there to Istanbul, Turkey, before continuing to London, according to Engh."
"US stocks are in a bubble, and it's unclear when it will pop, hedge fund manager says","New York (CNN Business) The V-shaped recovery in the stock market is gathering serious momentum.

The S&P 500 is now 75% higher than its low point last March. The Nasdaq has more than doubled since its pandemic low. Tesla shares are up a staggering 900% over that span. And an army of traders on Reddit were able to send GameStop to the moon , at least for a few days.

Although there is good reason for optimism about the economy and the pandemic, some fear the market euphoria is getting out of hand -- yet it's impossible to time the bubble's burst.

""I do think we are in a bubble like we were in 2000,"" veteran hedge fund manager Mark Yusko told CNN Business. ""That doesn't mean that tomorrow the market is going to crash.""

Yusko, the CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, pointed to signs of extreme market speculation, such as the 1,625% spike forin January.

""Equity markets broadly are in bubble territory. Look at the parabolic moves by a number of companies like Tesla,"" he said.

Apple's AAPL Yusko also pointed to howannual net income has barely budged over the past five years. But per-share earnings, which drive share prices, have climbed sharply because the iPhone maker has aggressively repurchased its shares.

""That's just financial engineering,"" he said.

Impossible to time

Zoom ZM DocuSign DOCU Another exhibit in Yusko's bubble case is Snowflake. The money-losing cloud computing company , which went public in September, is trading at 327 times revenue, according to data provider Refinitiv. That's well above what evenandtrade at.

Yusko's bubble warning echoes ones made in recent weeks by other well-known market players.

Last month famed investor Jeremy Grantham said the bull market that began in 2009 had ""matured into a full-fledged epic bubble"" marked by ""extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance and hysterically speculative investor behavior.""

Of course, no one can time when a bubble will pop. And overheated markets can get much hotter before finally cooling off.

""The challenge with extreme valuations is they can go on longer than you think,"" Yusko said.

And Yusko has been overly bearish before. Two years ago, he warned that the stock market was overvalued and tech stocks in particular would fall sharply. Yet the S&P 500 is up more than 40% since then — despite the worst pandemic in a century.

Morgan Stanley: Get on board or get out of the way

While Yusko and Grantham are sounding the alarm, some major Wall Street firms remain very optimistic on the economy and the stock market. They point to the persistence of rock-bottom interest rates that have forced investors to bet on stocks.

Goldman Sachs upgraded its forecasts for second-quarter 2021 and 2022 GDP on Monday because of a sense that Democrats will pass a significantly larger relief package than previously anticipated.

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs expects the S&P 500 to climb to 4,300 by year end, up about 11% from current levels.

Michael Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, thinks the stock market's Reddit-driven scare is already firmly in the rearview mirror.

""It appears that greed once again has the upper hand over fear and the bull market is ready to resume in earnest,"" Wilson wrote in a note to clients Sunday.

After suffering its worst week since October, the S&P 500 rapidly regained its losses last week, spiking 4.7%.

Even though Wilson has recently called out signs of complacency and extreme risk , he is warning his clients not to fight this market rally.

""The prevailing view of better economic growth, more fiscal stimulus to come and continued money printing from the fed has everyone 'all in,'"" Wilson wrote. ""When such periods occur, it's rarely been easy or wise to get in the way. Instead, these trends typically need to run their course until they are derailed or simply exhausted.""

SPAC mania

Even Yusko, the Morgan Creek hedge fund manager, is diving headfirst into one area of market speculation: SPAC mania.

Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are shells with no operating assets that exist purely to take private companies public. Virgin Galactic, DraftKings and Nikola have all gone public this way instead of a traditional IPO. Even former baseball superstar Alex Rodriguez is trying to raise $500 million through a SPAC called Slam Corp.

Late last month, Yusko launched Morgan Creek Exos SPAC Originated ETF, a fund that will target pre- and post-merger SPACs with an equal weight approach.

But some argue SPACs are more evidence of bubble-like behavior on Wall Street.

SPACs are ""an invitation to give me your money and I'll let you know one day what I'm going to do with it,"" Grantham recently told CNBC.

During the first three weeks of 2021 alone, SPACs raised $16 billion, surpassing the $13 billion that was raised in all of 2019, according to Goldman Sachs.

""Bubble-like sentiment surrounds SPACs,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said.

Yusko disagreed with that sentiment and suggested the criticism from Goldman Sachs is convenient because the Wall Street bank relies on traditional IPOs for a chunk of its revenue.

""It's intellectually lazy to make that statement,"" he said. ""Saying SPACs are the problem is like saying hedge funds or mutual funds are the problem. It's just a legal structure.""

Yusko said SPACs are cheaper, more flexible and a smarter way to raise money than traditional IPOs.

Unlike the other two SPAC ETFs that have recently launched, Yusko's fund is actively managed. That's critical, he said, because not all SPACs will be winners, especially given the loftiness of current market valuations.

""We are in an environment,"" Yusko said, ""where we believe caution is warranted."""
Biden administration will reengage with UN Human Rights Council,"Washington (CNN) The Biden administration will reengage with the United Nations Human Rights Council, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Monday -- its latest bid to reverse the policies of the Trump administration and return to a foreign policy with roots in multilateral institutions.

In a statement, the top US diplomat said that President Joe Biden ""has instructed the Department of State to reengage immediately and robustly with the UN Human Rights Council.""

The United States will begin that engagement in an observer role, Blinken said, ""and in that capacity will have the opportunity to speak in the Council, participate in negotiations, and partner with others to introduce resolutions.""

The UN Secretary General welcomed the US decision. Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement the the ""United Nations looks forward to hearing the crucial voice of the United States across the Council's urgent work.""

The Trump administration quit the UN Human Rights Council in 2018. Then-US Ambassador the theUN Nikki Haley accused the Geneva-based body of bias against Israel and failing to hold human rights abusers accountable.

""For too long,"" Haley said, ""the Human Rights Council has been a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias.""

""Human rights abusers continue to serve on, and be elected to, the council,"" she said. ""The world's most inhumane regimes continue to escape its scrutiny, and the council continues politicizing scapegoating of countries with positive human rights records in an attempt to distract from the abusers in its ranks.

There are 47 member states on the Council, and current members include countries that have been accused of grave human rights abuses like China, Russia and Venezuela.

In his statement, Blinken said, ""We recognize that the Human Rights Council is a flawed body, in need of reform to its agenda, membership, and focus, including its disproportionate focus on Israel.""

""However, our withdrawal in June 2018 did nothing to encourage meaningful change, but instead created a vacuum of U.S. leadership, which countries with authoritarian agendas have used to their advantage,"" he said.

""When it works well, the Human Rights Council shines a spotlight on countries with the worst human rights records and can serve as an important forum for those fighting injustice and tyranny,"" Blinken continued. ""The Council can help to promote fundamental freedoms around the globe, including freedoms of expression, association and assembly, and religion or belief as well as the fundamental rights of women, girls, LGBTQI+ persons, and other marginalized communities.""

""To address the Council's deficiencies and ensure it lives up to its mandate, the United States must be at the table using the full weight of our diplomatic leadership,"" he said.

The reengagement with the Human Rights Council is the latest effort to restore US standing on the global stage through involvement in multilateral organizations and treaties spurned by the Trump administration. Biden reversed the US departure from the World Health Organization. He also rejoined the Paris climate accord."
The coldest air in years is hitting parts of the US,"(CNN) Nearly 200 million Americans woke up Monday to temperatures below freezing, and even colder air could be on the way by this Valentine's Day weekend.

""This first push of arctic air is bringing dangerous cold but is mostly confined across the northern tier of states,"" says CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. ""This next round of cold air for this coming weekend looks even more intense and will dive south through much of the Plains into Texas and likely bring dozens of records.""

The early week cold air will be locked up across the northern half of the US, with high temperatures below freezing as far south as Oklahoma. Across northern Minnesota and much of Montana and North Dakota, highs will struggle to climb past zero.

The polar vortex is to blame. This feature that's normally centered over the North Pole has recently weakened, helping to displace very cold air into the US.

""Latest model guidance continues to show that an arctic air mass will dominate the northern and central portions of the country into this weekend under the influence of a slow-moving polar vortex centered over the Canadian prairies,"" the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center (WPC) says.

""Wind chill values well below zero and as low as (minus) 50 degrees could be experienced at times"" from Montana through the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, says the WPC.

Wind chill alerts are in effect early Monday afternoon for more than 5 million people. In some cases, that's so cold, frostbite can occur in just five minutes for those not properly dressed.

In Minneapolis, the high temperature Sunday only reached minus 3 degrees. The last time the high temperature was that cold was more than two years ago, in January 2019. Temperatures there rise back to the teens midweek before dropping again to around zero this weekend.

Fargo, North Dakota, is another city that hasn't witnessed this kind of cold in years. The high yesterday was minus 8. It hasn't been that cold since 2019, when the high was only 10 below. Highs should not be as low as this past weekend but will hover around the zero-degree mark this week.

Meanwhile, across the Southern states, temperatures will be above average, and in some cases, up to 20 degrees above the normal temperature for this time of year through Wednesday or Thursday.

But that will change as the week progresses.

Looking ahead through the next 7 days, bitterly #cold temperatures located in the north-central U.S. will slowly spread south and east by the weekend. In fact, nearly the entire Lower 48 could see below average high temperatures by Valentine's Day. 🥶 pic.twitter.com/gAZ4j1XGxL — NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) February 8, 2021

Cold air will hit every continental US state

The cold air will gradually expand southward. By the weekend, every state in the Lower 48 should experience below-average temperatures. The only area that may still be on the warmer side of normal is South Florida.

A very slow-moving cold front draped across the Southern Plains will serve as the boundary between high temperatures in the 30s and 40s across North Texas and 70s and 80s across central and southern Texas through mid-week.

On Wednesday, Dallas has a forecast high in the mid-40s, while Austin should be in the mid-70s. That's about a 30-degree temperature difference in just over 200 miles.

The second half of this week will feature temperatures topping off below zero in the northern Plains. Teens and 20s are forecast from the interior Northwest through the central Plains, Midwest and into the interior Northeast, with the 40s and 50s expected in the South and Southeast.

In some cases, these high temperatures could break records for cold.

Low temperatures will be even lower, with every state in the contiguous US except Florida forecast to drop below freezing.

Within the next seven days, 40 million people could experience temperatures sub-zero.

During Valentine's Day weekend, another blast of dangerously cold air is expected to arrive.

The coldest air relative to normal may be in the south-central US.

""Some areas in the Plains and in Texas could be 40 degrees or more below average. Highs which are normally above freezing for this time of year will see highs in the single digits,"" says Hennen.

The Midwest and Northeast will also likely deal with the cold. The lowest temperatures of the next seven days may not come until the weekend.

In New York City, the coldest temperature so far this winter was 14 degrees, recorded in late January. In the next seven to 10 days, it may get even colder than that, with lows potentially in the single digits.

In Chicago, highs are projected to only be in the single digits. This hasn't happened since January 2019, when it was 1 degree.

The long-range forecast suggests that the cold will continue to dominate the weather pattern across the US next week.

""Unfortunately, these below-average temperatures don't appear to moderate or exit in the foreseeable future,"" the WPC said."
CBO says raising minimum wage to $15 would reduce poverty but increase the deficit and cost jobs,"(CNN) Raising the federal hourly minimum wage to $15 would reduce poverty -- but would also cut employment by 1.4 million workers and increase the federal deficit by $54 billion over a decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office report released Monday.

The proposed hike, which would take full effect by 2025, would increase worker pay by $333 billion, giving a boost to some 17 million workers whose wages would otherwise be below $15, as well as many of the 10 million workers whose wages would otherwise be slightly above that level.

The move would also reduce the number of people in poverty by 900,000 and result in lower spending on food stamps and child nutrition programs. However, spending on Medicaid and unemployment benefits would increase because of higher enrollment by those who lose their jobs, the CBO said of the Raise the Wage Act, introduced last month by a group of Democratic lawmakers.

Also, spending on Medicaid and Medicare would increase because of higher labor costs, since many home health and nursing care workers make less than $15 an hour.

Supporters of the minimum wage boost, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, quickly jumped on the CBO's findings that it would reduce employment. They argue that the agency's methodology was flawed.

New push to increase the minimum wage

The battle over raising the minimum wage, a longtime Democratic goal, was reignited last month when President Joe Biden included it in his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. The minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009.

However, the measure has already run into resistance on Capitol Hill, including from some Democrats, such as West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who favors a smaller hike.

Democratic leaders are fast-tracking the passage of Biden's pandemic relief package through a legislative process known as reconciliation , which only requires a majority of votes. However, the party could not afford to lose the support of any member, assuming no Republican senators vote for it.

Biden conceded in an interview with ""CBS Evening News with Norah O'Donnell"" that he does not believe he will be able to raise the minimum wage due to the Senate's rules.

""I put it in, but I don't think it's going to survive,"" Biden said in excerpts of an interview that aired Friday.

However, Sanders, chair of the Senate Budget Committee and a fierce advocate of the increase, took issue Monday with the CBO report, pointing to the agency's analysis two years ago that concluded a wage hike would increase the deficit by less than $1 million over a decade. He also referenced other studies that found that raising the wage would significantly reduce the deficit.

The senator doubled down on his intention to include the provision in the relief package, saying the CBO report backs his contention that increasing the minimum wage would have an impact on the budget and could be included in a reconciliation bill.

He told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that a ""room full of lawyers"" is working to make the case that a minimum wage increase conforms to those rules.

""I can tell you as chairman of the (Senate Budget Committee), we have a room full of lawyers working as hard as we can to make the case to the parliamentarian that, in fact, raising the minimum wage will have significant budget implications and, in fact, should be consistent with reconciliation rules,"" Sanders told Tapper on ""State of the Union.""

Higher wages vs lower employment

The CBO report resurfaced longstanding arguments between Democrats and worker advocates on one side, who say that paying people a higher wage will have a positive impact on their lives, the federal budget and the economy, and Republicans and business owners on the other side, who warn that such a move will cost jobs.

One recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that 80% of economic research over the last 30 years found there are job losses associated with a higher minimum wage. The evidence of a negative impact is stronger for teens and young adults, as well as the less-educated.

A wage increase this large would have a greater effect than the modest increases looked at by those past studies, said David Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California Irvine and one of the recent report's authors.

""It's going to get proportionately worse as it goes higher and higher because you affect a greater share of workers,"" said Neumark, who has long written about the negative impact that raising the minimum wage would have on employment.

He also noted that in some low-wage states, more than half of workers now make less than $15 an hour.

But proponents argue that better-quality studies tend to show that increases in the minimum wage do not hurt employment.

""We believe that the CBO's assumptions on the scale of job loss are just wrong and inappropriately inflated relative to what cutting-edge economics literature would indicate,"" said a team of experts from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.

The CBO did not properly weight the higher-quality studies in its analysis, said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the institute.

Supporters also highlighted the CBO's findings that raising the minimum wage would help many lower-income Americans, many of whom are essential workers, people of color and women.

""Today's report makes clear what we've known all along: Raising the minimum wage -- which hasn't increased since 2009 -- to $15 an hour isn't just the right thing to do, it's good policy that will give a raise to up to 27 million workers and lift almost one million people out of poverty,"" said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat and one of the co-sponsors of the bill.

New minimum wage push in Congress

A coalition of Democratic lawmakers, including Sanders, last month introduced the Raise the Wage Act, which calls for gradually increasing the hourly wage in increments until it hits $15 in 2025.

After that, it would be indexed to median wage growth -- a move meant to guarantee wages keep up with inflation without needing new legislation.

Sanders has been a longtime proponent of boosting the wage, saying no full-time worker in the US should be unable to afford to feed their families or pay the rent. He has slammed companies for paying wages that are so low that their workers need federal assistance, including food stamps.

The so-called Fight for $15 dates back to 2012, when fast-food workers walked off the job in New York City to call attention to their battle for higher pay.

Backed heavily by unions and consumer advocates, the effort has succeeded in eight states and more than 40 cities , which have adopted laws to raise their minimum wage to $15."
Biden says closed schools and loss of women in workforce is a 'national emergency',"Biden told ""CBS Evening News with Norah O'Donnell"" that he believed it was ""time for schools to reopen safely,"" ahead of the expected release this week of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guide to reopening schools.

""I think they're going through a lot, these kids,"" Biden said.

The President's comments come amid a national debate about when and how to get students back in classrooms safely, as the pandemic continues to devastate the nation and has forced many classes completely online. They also come as women, particularly Black and Latina women, suffer steep job losses as they disproportionately work in some of the hardest-hit sectors in the pandemic, including education.

Biden, who has said he wants most K-12 schools to reopen before his first 100 days in office, emphasized in the interview the need for schools to implement stringent safety requirements to keep those in the classroom safe.

""About 20 million American children have not been in the classroom for nearly a year. There's a mental health crisis happening,"" O'Donnell said.

""There really is,"" Biden said, nodding.

""Women are dropping out of the workforce,"" O'Donnell continued. ""Is this a national emergency?""

""It is a national emergency,"" Biden responded. ""It genuinely is a national emergency.""

""I think it's time for schools to reopen safely. Safely,"" the President said. He pointed to lowering the number of people allowed in each classroom and proper ventilation systems as examples of necessary protocols.

Biden said US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky would be coming out with the guidance, which he described as ""science-based judgment,"" as early as Wednesday.

""I think about the price, so many of my grandkids and your kids are going to pay for not having had the chance to finish whatever it was. That graduation where you didn't get to walk across the stage,"" Biden said.

Walensky said Monday that the best way to get schools to reopen safely ""is to decrease the community spread,"" and to keep up mitigation measures such as masking and social distancing.

""The data from schools suggest that there is very little transmission that is happening within the schools, especially when there's masking and distancing occurring. And that when there are transmissions in the schools, it is because they've been brought in from the community and because there are breaches in masking and distancing,"" Walensky said during a White House briefing.

Last week, Walensky suggested that schools could reopen without teachers getting Covid-19 vaccines. White House press secretary Jen Psaki initially said Walensky was speaking ""in her personal capacity"" and said that though Walensky was the head of the CDC, her comments were not the same as official CDC guidance. But Psaki later appeared to agree with Walensky, saying vaccinations were only part of several mitigating factors that will help schools reopen safely, including wearing masks and social distancing.

Part of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package Biden has proposed to Congress includes additional funding for schools to operate safely in person. Biden has also signed several executive actions to help support reopening schools and establish a national strategy to get the pandemic under control.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, recently cautioned that reopening most schools within 100 days ""may not happen,"" as the US continues to grapple with high Covid-19 transmission. The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 463,500 Americans as of Monday morning."
Biden administration will review deportation of veterans and their families,"(CNN) The Biden administration will review the deportations of veterans and their family members, according to a White House official.

The move is in line with a Department of Homeland Security memo released shortly after President Joe Biden took office outlining new agency enforcement priorities and kicking off agency reviews.

According to the memo, national security, border security and public safety threats would be prioritized for enforcement -- a move reminiscent of the Obama-era's ""felons, not families"" deportation policy.

""As a military parent, President Biden knows the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make for our country each and every day. The administration's immigration enforcement will focus on those who are national security and public safety threats, not military families, service members or veterans,"" said White House spokesman Vedant Patel in a statement.

""The federal government in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security will take further review of removals of veterans and their family members,"" he added."
This woman used Gorilla Glue instead of hair spray. She ended up in the hospital,"(CNN) A Louisiana woman has sought medical treatment after mistakenly using Gorilla Glue spray adhesive in place of actual hair spray.

Tessica Brown's plight went viral earlier in February after she revealed that her hair had been stuck in the same style for a month since she substituted her usual Got2b Glued spray with the industrial-strength glue when she ran out.

""My hair, it don't move. You hear what I'm telling you? It don't move,"" she said in the original video posted to TikTok.

""I've washed my hair 15 times.""

In another video she was seen slathering on shampoo, which failed to penetrate her rock-hard hair."
Black people in history: Little-known figures to know,"Eunice Hunton Carter was a social worker and prosecutor whose investigative work in New York City in the 1930s led to what was then the largest prosecution of organized crime in US history.

When notorious mob boss Charles “Lucky” Luciano met his downfall, the credit went to the young prosecutor Thomas Dewey, who eventually ran for president.

But it was Carter, an assistant district attorney on his team, who laid the foundation for the case.

Carter was born in Atlanta, the granddaughter of enslaved people. In 1932, she became the first Black woman to graduate from Fordham Law School – at a time when few lawyers were Black or women, let alone Black women.

By then Carter was already married to a dentist and had a son, but she had no interest in being a society mom.

She soon became the first African American woman in New York state to serve as assistant district attorney. As the only woman on Dewey’s team, which had been assembled to fight organized crime, she was relegated to mostly prosecuting crimes against women, such as prostitution.

But while doing so, she discovered that brothels in New York were controlled by Luciano’s mob, which received a share of their earnings in exchange for legal representation. Her painstaking investigative skills built the case against Luciano and led to his conviction in 1936.

Later Carter went into private practice and on to a litany of other accomplishments, including a committee chair at the United Nations."
GOP Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama won't run for reelection,"(CNN) Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama announced Monday that he will not run for reelection in 2022, after serving 42 years in Congress.

""Today I announce that I will not seek a seventh term in the US Senate in 2022,"" the 86-year-old Republican said in a statement. ""For everything, there is a season.""

Shelby's announcement follows several other high profile Republican senators who've announced plans to not run for reelection in 2020. Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio have both said they will not run again when their term is up next year.

Shelby chaired the Appropriations, Rules, Banking and Intelligence committees in the Senate. He said he was proud of his work focusing on the economy, education, space exploration and, ever the appropriator, the Port of Mobile.

Shelby's decision will open up a fierce race in the deep red state. Possible candidates include Shelby's former chief of staff, Katie Boyd Britt, who is now the president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and Rep. Mo Brooks.

House Democrats ask Biden White House for documents related to alleged Trump administration political interference in Covid response,"(CNN) House Democrats on Monday asked the Biden administration to hand over long-sought documents from the Trump administration regarding its response to the coronavirus pandemic, renewing an investigation into what role alleged political interference by former officials may have played in the virus' threat.

In letters obtained by CNN to White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain and acting head of Health and Human Services Norris Cochran, House Majority Whip James Clyburn alleges the Trump administration ""refused to cooperate"" with inquiries from the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis; that HHS blocked documents and witnesses related to the response to the virus; and that Trump officials ""failed to fully comply with two subpoenas and at least 20 document requests"" by the committee.

Arguing that the committee needs the documents to continue its investigation, the South Carolina Democratic congressman also alleged that new documents obtained by the committee show the Trump administration took ""efforts to suppress science during the pandemic."" The documents include an email by former HHS senior adviser Paul Alexander where the committee alleges he ""pressured Food and Drug Administration officials to quickly approve emergency use of convalescent plasma and advised them to disregard concerns"" from Dr. Anthony Fauci and National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins.

The request is the latest example of House Democrats continuing to pursue investigations against former President Donald Trump and his officials after he has left office and comes a day before the Senate impeachment trial against Trump.

Clyburn requested both Biden administration officials submit documents from January 1, 2020, to Inauguration Day to the committee by March 1 on ""all organizational charts and staff lists"" related to the White House's coronavirus pandemic response, documents regarding ""public health guidance, plans, or proposals"" about the pandemic and weekly reports from the White House Coronavirus Task Force.

Seniors are having trouble getting Covid-19 vaccines. These cousins set up a system to help,"Want more inspiring, positive news? Sign up for The Good Stuff , a newsletter for the good in life. It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.

(CNN) Cousins Jacqueline Teague and Amelie Beck are juggling hybrid learning, extracurricular activities and now a volunteer project helping seniors in Kentucky get Covid-19 vaccine appointments.

After helping their own grandparents get the vaccine in Louisville, the pair knew there were other seniors in their community who would benefit from a helping hand.

So far, the high school students in Louisville have helped 400 seniors register to get their vaccine with Norton Healthcare Hospital network , one of three health care partners allowing sign-ups for the vaccine in Kentucky

Kentucky currently has 376,253 confirmed cases and has administered 483,777 doses with 93,651 people fully vaccinated, according to data from Johns Hopkins

Kentucky is administering vaccines to anyone 70 and over, first responders, K-12 school personnel, health-care personnel and at assisted-living and long-term care facilities, according to its plan . Twenty-eight states include people ages 65 and older in their phase 1a or 1b priority groups as of January 19, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation

Older people are struggling

Many of the nation's 50 million seniors over 65 are struggling to navigate confusing vaccine distribution plans that can differ from state to state and in some cases, county to county.

""I would estimate 10% to 20% are at risk of missing out on vaccines because they're homebound, live alone, don't have transportation or lack reliable social connections,"" Dr. Anand Iyer, an Alabama pulmonologist who specializes in caring for older adults said. ""Unfortunately, those are the same factors that put them at risk of poor outcomes from Covid.""

Despite these problems, the extent of this phenomenon has not been documented yet.

""I think the most important part of this is them (seniors) knowing that we're there for them every step of the way,"" Beck said. ""Everyone has been so lonely, locked up for almost 10 months so it's really a sense of relief for them to be able to get the vaccine because they're so scared.""

Tech support for Covid-19 vaccines

The pair said they completed the entire sign-up process for their own grandparents because they had issues getting through verification processes and authentication steps, ""and then when we started helping their friends, we realized it was a more common issue than we expected,"" Teague said.

Two weeks ago, the duo created a template, set up a private Facebook page and a phone line for seniors all over Kentucky to call if they need help scheduling their vaccine, dubbed VaxConnectKY.

Shortly after the template was made, Teague and Beck's grade school and high school ended up posting the flyer on their respective Facebook pages and calls started pouring in. The two say they won't stop until the requests come to a halt.

VaxConnectKY's template they send to area seniors who need a step-by-step guide on how to register for their Covid-19 vaccine.

VaxConnectKY's system is simple: A request falls into their hands, they help seniors get into or create a MyNortonChart account so they can enter their health information on their own.

The cousins don't take anyone's sensitive information themselves; they just guide people through the technical steps.

Seniors without internet access are a big concern to the pair.

""We give them a phone number to go on a hospital waitlist,"" Teague said. ""We feel like they appreciate the contact or touch point.""

Kate Eller, system director of communications and public relations at Norton Healthcare, praised the cousins for their effort.

""We appreciate these young women for seeing a need and helping to provide an essential and heart-felt service,"" she told CNN in a statement. ""Their idea to help seniors in our community register for their COVID-19 vaccinations is a great example of true servant leadership.

""Technology can be challenging, and we have been encouraging seniors to ask for help from friends or family when possible.""

Because the cousins are doing hybrid learning, their alternating school schedules allow them to work on VaxConnectKY around the clock. When one is in school, the other is manning the calls and emails.

On days when they're both busy, Beck said they're calling people back on their lunch breaks and between classes with help from their siblings who they've also trained to step in when necessary.

""We've had people calling us, breaking down about how they're grateful to us that we're helping them get it and now they're finally able to get it, "" Beck said. ""It's a good feeling for us knowing that we are helping without contributing to Kentucky's numbers in Covid-19 cases.""

VaxConnectKY has successfully helped people in New Jersey and Florida, Teague said. They're currently researching how to help a request that's come from Missouri though the pair say they don't have the bandwidth to expand anymore to states outside of Kentucky.

To assist, CNN has created a list of vaccination information pages for all 50 states and territories. The phone number, email and website for each state is included.

""We wish the system was more simplified,"" Teague said. ""There's a lot of hoops you have to jump through to get your appointment, so I just wish the whole system was easier to navigate."""
GOP Rep. Ron Wright dies following Covid diagnosis,"Washington (CNN) Republican Rep. Ron Wright of Texas has died, his congressional office announced in a statement Monday, saying that he had been admitted to the hospital after contracting Covid-19.

""Congressman Ron Wright passed away peacefully at the age of 67 on Feb. 7, 2021. His wife Susan was by his side and he is now in the presence of their Lord and Savior,"" the statement read. ""For the previous two weeks, Ron and Susan had been admitted to Baylor Hospital in Dallas after contracting COVID-19.""

Wright is the first sitting member of Congress to die after contracting Covid. In December, Congressman-elect Luke Letlow died after being diagnosed with the disease.

Wright's congressional office announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19 on January 21 with the congressman saying at the time in a statement, ""I am experiencing minor symptoms, but overall, I feel okay and will continue working for the people of the 6th District from home this week.""

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a statement Monday, ""Our hearts are heavy with the news of Ron's passing. Judy and I send our heartfelt prayers to Susan and their children during this very difficult time.""

Trump lawyers argue former President did not incite riots by telling supporters to 'fight like hell',"(CNN) Donald Trump's legal team accused House Democrats Monday of engaging in ""political theater"" and argued that the upcoming Senate impeachment trial is unconstitutional because Trump is no longer President.

""This was only ever a selfish attempt by Democratic leadership in the House to prey upon the feelings of horror and confusion that fell upon all Americans across the entire political spectrum upon seeing the destruction at the Capitol on January 6 by a few hundred people,"" Trump's lawyers wrote in a second pretrial brief filed Monday.

""Instead of acting to heal the nation, or at the very least focusing on prosecuting the lawbreakers who stormed the Capitol, the Speaker of the House and her allies have tried to callously harness the chaos of the moment for their own political gain,"" the brief states.

The House managers will have an opportunity to push back on the Trump team's latest round of pretrial arguments.

On Monday, they filed their response to Trump team's initial pretrial brief, rebutting claims that both the former President and most Senate Republicans are making that the trial itself is unconstitutional.

The Democrats' legal briefing was in response to last week's filing from the Trump team , and is a preview of the arguments that will be made in the Senate when the trial begins on Tuesday.

""The evidence of President Trump's conduct is overwhelming. He has no valid excuse or defense for his actions. And his efforts to escape accountability are entirely unavailing,"" the House managers write. ""As charged in the Article of Impeachment, President Trump violated his Oath of Office and betrayed the American people. His incitement of insurrection against the United States government -- which disrupted the peaceful transfer of power -- is the most grievous constitutional crime ever committed by a president.""

The five-page House brief from Monday says that Trump can stand trial in the Senate for a crime that he committed while in office. ""Presidents swear a sacred oath that binds them from their first day in office through their very last,"" the Democrats write.

Trump lawyers claim 'fight like hell' comments were not literal

The 75-page legal brief from Trump's attorneys expands upon their initial response to the House's impeachment last week, in which they argued that the trial was unconstitutional, that Trump didn't incite the rioters and that his speech spreading false conspiracies about widespread election fraud is protected by the First Amendment.

Specifically, the brief filed Monday claims that Trump urged those gathered on January 6 to be peaceful and argues that his call for the crowd to ""fight like hell,"" was not meant to be taken literally.

""And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,"" Trump said at the time.

""Of the over 10,000 words spoken, Mr. Trump used the word 'fight' a little more than a handful of times and each time in the figurative sense that has long been accepted in public discourse when urging people to stand and use their voices to be heard on matters important to them; it was not and could not be construed to encourage acts of violence,"" Trump's lawyers wrote.

""To characterize this statement alone as 'incitement to insurrection' is to ignore, wholesale, the remainder of Mr. Trump's speech that day, including his call for his supporters to 'peacefully' making their 'voices heard,'"" they added.

Trump's lawyers also sought to distance the former President from those who committed acts of violence on January 6 by claiming they did so on their ""own accord.""

""The real truth is that the people who criminally breached the Capitol did so of their own accord and for their own reasons, and they are being criminally prosecuted,"" they wrote.

Last week, House Democrats filed their own initial pretrial brief , which provided the impeachment managers' most detailed argument to date for why Trump's actions surrounding the January 6 attack on the Capitol warranted his second impeachment in a little over a year, making him the first president in US history to have been impeached twice.

The impeachment managers charged that Trump's actions in the months leading up to January 6 of baselessly claiming the election was stolen from him created the conditions for a violent mob to be aimed ""like a loaded cannon down Pennsylvania Avenue"" to attack the Capitol.

""President Trump created a powder keg on January 6. Hundreds were prepared for violence at his direction. They were prepared to do whatever it took to keep him in power,"" the managers wrote. ""All they needed to hear was that their President needed them to 'fight like hell.' All they needed was for President Trump to strike a match.""

On Monday, House Democrats pushed back on the Trump legal team's contention that Trump's false claims the election was stolen from him were protected by the First Amendment and could not be proven inaccurate.

""President Trump's repeated claims about a 'rigged' and 'stolen' election were false, no matter how many contortions his lawyers undertake to avoid saying so,"" the House managers wrote.

New York City middle schools will reopen to some students for the first time in months,"(CNN) Some New York City middle school students in grades six through eight will return to classrooms on February 25, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday.

Teachers and staff will return the prior day, de Blasio said.

NYC Department of Education Chancellor Richard Carranza said he was ""thrilled"" to announce the return. Both the mayor and chancellor stressed the effects of isolation that students and teachers are feeling.

"Despite huge losses, US airlines are rolling in cash","New York (CNN Business) The US airline industry just closed the books on the worst year in its history , losing a combined $32 billion excluding special items. Yet it still ended 2020 awash in an ocean of cash.

The nation's four largest airlines --and-- among themhad $31.5 billion in cash on their balance sheets at the end of 2020. That's up from $13 billion a year earlier, before the pandemic hit. ""Liquidity"" has become a favorite buzzword of airline executives discussing their financial condition. Including the cash and yet untapped credit lines, the airlines have access tonearly $65 billion.

""The liquidity is at record levels,"" said Philip Baggaley, chief credit analyst for the airline industry at Standard & Poor's. ""That's good, and it's one of the few strong points they have at this point.""

The airlines received substantial financial help from the federal government , but most of that money was required to be spent keeping staff on payrolls temporarily.

The lion's share of the borrowing and cash, then, comes from from banks and Wall Street. Like a struggling family flooded with credit card offers, the airlines have a lot of people eager to give them cash.

The borrowing has added about $40 billion in long-term debt to the balance sheets of the nation's airlines.

""I think the general feeling is they're wounded but they're going to make it,"" said Baggaley. The low interest rate environment has helped the airlines, as investors and banks looking for yields have been willing to lend to the airlines, he added. All the carriers except Southwest have junk bond credit ratings.

They have also made deep cost cuts, even with government help that prevented them from making permanent, involuntary job cuts.

The airlines used buyouts and early retirement to cut about 16% of the staff they had at the start of 2021. In recent weeks, American and United sent out layoff notices to 27,000 employees between them, saying they could again be furloughed unless there is a third round of government assistance before April 1.

Many of those employees had been laid off in October when the first round of federal payroll support ran out, and were called back to work in December when the second Covid relief package provided an additional $17 billion to the industry. Last week, airline unions were back on Capitol Hill appealing for another round of help to keep their members employed.

The cost cuts slashed the rate at which the airlines burned through cash by about half between the second quarter to the fourth quarter last year, even as air travel and revenues remained a fraction of what they were before the pandemic.

But even as they trimmed the pace of cash burn, the four airlines combined blew through $115 million a day over the course of the final nine months of 2020. And they expect to continue burning through cash, albeit at a slower pace, in the first half of 2021. Building a substantial cash reserve is the only sure way to get through this unprecedented financial crisis, airline executives say.

""Our industry still has a long path to recovery ahead,"" said American CEO Doug Parker on recent conference call with investors. He said the accumulation of cash, combined with cost cutting, built up ""gives us confidence that we are well positioned for the year ahead and the long term.""

Other than Southwest, which just posted its first annual loss since 1973, the nation's other major airlines all have at least one bankruptcy in their histories. The industry's current strong cash position raises hopes that they can avoid that fate this time. But that depends on when traffic returns, and even the airlines aren't sure when that will be.

""I've got 10 straight months of data saying that people are ready to travel in six months. It keeps saying the same thing,"" American's Parker said in an interview on CNBC recently. ""What I do believe is that once people are comfortable, it will come back relatively quickly. There is huge pent-up demand to travel. We hear it everywhere we go. But no one is going to travel until there are things to do when you travel, and until the vaccine is distributed and the pandemic is largely eradicated.""

S&P's Baggaley believes airlines ""are past the worst of it,"" he said. None of them have filed for bankruptcy, and he believes the odds are that they won't.

""It's a reasonable concern that they are going to emerge from this with a lot more debt,"" he said."
Two impeachment trials in less than two years. Here's how we got here,"(CNN) Former President Donald Trump's second Senate impeachment trial will commence on Tuesday, setting up a week (or two) that will be equal parts historic and divisive.

The outcome of the trial is really not in doubt. Trump is poised to be acquitted by the Senate, where it would take a two-thirds vote to convict him. At least 17 Republicans would need to join all of the Senate Democrats to convict.

However, the trial will still bring drama. Trump is not expected to appear, after his lawyers rejected a Democratic request to testify.

His lawyers are expected to argue that the Senate cannot impeach a former president and that Trump's January 6 speech at the White House Ellipse preceding the US Capitol insurrection was protected by the First Amendment.

The House impeachment managers will argue that Trump is ""singularly responsible"" for inciting the insurrection, and that he should be barred from holding future office.

Read the pre-trial brief from Trump's legal team here.

The House impeachment managers' brief is here.

How long will the trial last? That's an open question at this point. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and their aides have been engaged in extensive discussions about the trial's organizing resolution, which the Senate will pass before arguments begin.

Both sides hope to reach a bipartisan agreement on the trial's parameters, which will include how long the impeachment managers and defense team get to make their arguments, how witnesses could be called and other matters.

Two impeachments in two years

Trump made history as the only impeached President to run for reelection, and then last month -- after his loss to Biden was sealed -- became the only President in US history to be impeached twice.

Let's review exactly how we got here.

'Stop the Steal'

The road to Trump's second impeachment began in earnest during an election night address when he falsely claimed that he had already won reelection. Read what CNN's Daniel Dale wrote that night -- that it was the ""most dishonest speech"" of Trump's presidency.

The conspiracy theory Trump laid out then metastasized into the defining message of Trump's final weeks in office as he and his allies in conservative media and Congress sought to sow doubt not just over Biden's win but over the integrity of the US election system.

But Trump remained undeterred by that reality. Instead of accepting his loss and moving toward a transition, he and his allies set their sights on Congress' largely ceremonial role in certifying Electoral College votes on January 6 as a final stage where the will of the voters could be subverted.

This culminated in Trump's speech near the White House. The President told a crowd of supporters to march to the Capitol building, where Congress was set to formalize his loss in a gathering presided over by Vice President Mike Pence.

""We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong,"" he said at that rally, less than an hour before the certification was due to begin.

After he spoke, Trump returned to the White House in an armored SUV and hunkered indoors. But his supporters, emboldened by Trump's call to action, marched east to the seat of the legislative branch, where they climbed over scaffolding already in place for Biden's inauguration to launch an unprecedented breach of the Capitol that engulfed DC in chaos.

Only after pleading from aides and congressional allies inside the besieged building did Trump release a video urging the rioters to ""go home,"" while still fanning their baseless grievances about a stolen election. ""We love you,"" Trump said. ""You're very special."" Later, he seemed to justify the actions in a tweet, writing, ""These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away.""

The insurrection left five dead, including an officer with the US Capitol Police

Congress reconvened later that night to complete its task, and Biden's win was certified in the early hours of January 7 -- a step delayed by the decision of Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley to proceed with an objection to counting Biden's victory in Pennsylvania.

Democrats act fast

Democrats moved quickly after the insurrection to organize an impeachment effort over Trump's role in whipping up the mob.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced just two days after the episode that her party was prepared to move forward with impeachment if Trump didn't resign immediately.

""It is the hope of Members that the President will immediately resign. But if he does not, I have instructed the Rules Committee to be prepared to move forward with Congressman Jamie Raskin's 25th Amendment legislation and a motion for impeachment,"" Pelosi said at the time.

""Accordingly, the House will preserve every option -- including the 25th Amendment, a motion to impeach or a privileged resolution for impeachment.""

Trump didn't resign and his Cabinet didn't invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. The following Monday, Democrats formally introduced their impeachment resolution, charging Trump with ""incitement of insurrection.""

The single impeachment article specifically points to Trump's repeated false claims that he won the election and his speech to the crowd on January 6 before the rioters breached the Capitol. It also cited Trump's January 2 call with Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger , where the President urged him to ""find"" enough votes for Trump to win the state.

""In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,"" the resolution said.

""He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.""

The House voted to impeach Trump 232 to 197 two days after their resolution was formally introduced, and exactly one week after rioters forced lawmakers to flee from the very chamber in which they cast ballots.

Senate trial delay

The blazing House impeachment process prompted a push among Democrats for an immediate Senate trial, potentially before Trump left office on January 20. McConnell rejected those calls and ultimately struck a deal with Schumer that allowed some formal steps in late January before the trial formally begins this week -- a delay that allowed the Senate to confirm some key Cabinet members as well as time for Trump's defense team to prepare.

The delay also -- critically -- allowed the immediate shock to subside and gave Republicans a window to get a sense of support for impeachment within their party.

Initially several Republicans claimed they were keeping an open mind, but as more time has passed, GOP leaders have become increasingly bullish that Trump isn't at risk of conviction.

The clearest indicator came when GOP Sen. Rand Paul raised a point of order that the trial of an ex-president was unconstitutional. Only five Republicans split from the party.

Democrats and Republicans alike have pointed to the vote on Paul's point of order as a measure for how the trial's final vote will likely land. And McConnell sided with Paul in the vote -- suggesting his initial signals that he might be open to convicting Trump are not likely to result in him voting that way.

The current reality

That brings us to now.

Given the way GOP lawmakers have aligned behind Trump in recent weeks, the trial for Democrats will be as much about holding him accountable in the public eye than securing a conviction -- a reality that the House impeachment managers' fiery pre-trial briefs signal they're prepared for.

""President Trump's effort to extend his grip on power by fomenting violence against Congress was a profound violation of the oath he swore,"" the House impeachment team wrote. ""If provoking an insurrectionary riot against a Joint Session of Congress after losing an election is not an impeachable offense, it is hard to imagine what would be."""
Social media helps Native Americans preserve cultural traditions during pandemic,"WOLF POINT, Mont. (KHN) Lawrence Wetsit misses the days when his people would gather by the hundreds and sing the songs that all Assiniboine children are expected to learn by age 15.

""We can't have ceremony without memorizing all of the songs, songs galore,"" he said. ""We're not supposed to record them: We have to be there. And when that doesn't happen in my grandchildren's life, they may never catch up.""

Such ceremonial gatherings have been scarce over the past year as Native American communities like Wetsit's isolate to protect their elders during the Covid-19 pandemic. Reservations have been hit especially hard, with Native Americans nearly twice as likely to die as white people. Wetsit, a tribal elder and former chair of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes, said that his tribe lost one person a day on average to the disease during October and November.

These deaths are doubly devastating to Native communities because elders are seen as the keepers of tribal history and culture. Wetsit worries that the combination of deaths and lockdowns will permanently harm the tribe's ability to share traditional knowledge and oral history.

""Our grandchildren will feel it in their generation,"" he said. ""It's like taking a number of pages of their textbook and ripping it out and throwing it away.""

With that in mind, many Native people have found innovative ways throughout the pandemic to continue sharing their culture despite physical distancing restrictions. Social media groups have provided some remedies, in ways that may continue after the pandemic wanes.

""If there was ever a time where we could see how interconnected our world is, that time is now,"" said Jeneda Benally, a musician and member of the Navajo tribe in Arizona.

One Facebook group, known as Social Distance Powwow , has helped its Native members connect through sharing videos of drumming, dancing and other traditions. Since its founding in March, the group has accumulated more than 227,000 members and taken on a life of its own, with people sharing prayer requests, birthday celebrations and death announcements.

""We didn't expect it to take off like it did,"" said the group's co-founder Dan Simonds, an artist based in Bozeman, Montana, and a member of the Pequot tribe. ""It showed how much something like this was needed.""

For group members who rarely leave their isolated reservations, the videos provide an opportunity to see other tribes' homes and traditions for the first time. ""Every tribe is different, like every European country,"" Simonds said.

The group has provided a platform to talk about important issues. In January, organizers hosted a Facebook live chat with a doctor, nurses and community representatives who could answer group members' questions about Covid vaccines. Skepticism about the safety of vaccination tends to be high among Native Americans, and more than 9,500 people viewed the event. ""People are listening and learning,"" Simonds said.

Simonds expects the group will continue after the pandemic ends, and he has created a nonprofit spinoff that plans to hold in-person powwows once it is safe. ""This is one of the first times in history we have our own space by Natives where Natives can be heard,"" he said.

Among other powwow events that have seen an online resurgence is the jingle dress dance , an Ojibwe tradition usually performed by groups of women wearing skirts adorned with tinkling metal bells. Women from various tribes have been posting Instagram videos of themselves dancing alone at home.

Brenda Child , an Ojibwe historian at the University of Minnesota, is not surprised that the dance has become so popular during the pandemic. ""Most women and young girls are very aware that that is a healing tradition,"" she said.

According to legend, jingle dress dancing arose during the 1918 flu pandemic when a father with a sick little girl dreamed of a healing dance and had the dresses made for four women in his tribe. The girl recovered and became one of the first jingle dress dancers.

Child said the jingle dress tradition resonates because it is supposed to heal both the body and the mind during a time when fear and grief are rampant. ""Ojibwe have always been aware there's this psychological aspect to disease,"" she said.

But some traditions are more difficult to share online, particularly those that rely on oral stories told by elders. Internet access can be scarce on remote reservations, and many older people struggle to use technologies like video chat. ""It's hard enough for our communities and elders to transmit that information to the next generation, but trying to find a way to do that with social distancing in this era is especially hard,"" said Clayson Benally, Jeneda's brother.

Since the Benallys' band, Sihasin, can't tour during the pandemic, the siblings have been performing online. They are also making instructional videos of traditional Navajo practices such as shearing sheep and harvesting medicinal plants.

""This is my desperate attempt to ensure that our culture continues to exist,"" said Jeneda Benally. ""Even though we're losing people, this knowledge still exists. I don't want our people to sink into a depression.""

Some practices are too sacred to share online, she said. Tribal members must walk a fine line between keeping people engaged and revealing privileged information to outsiders at the risk of cultural appropriation. Certain rituals, symbols and stories are meant to be shared only orally — many tribes forbid members from even writing them down.

""It's tricky because we have to be very cautious,"" said Clayson Benally. ""Our ancestors would never have imagined we're teaching our ways through these airwaves that exist.""

Many Indigenous languages are in danger of disappearing forever, as speakers tend to be elderly and in fragile health. The pandemic has accelerated the threat.

""It's the equivalent of having jumped forward 10 years and lost speakers that would have been with us still but now are gone,"" said Wilhelm Meya, a member of the Lakota tribe and CEO of the nonprofit The Language Conservancy (TLC).

Meya's organization preserves Indigenous languages through recordings, dictionaries, dubbed movies and lessons — mostly developed by sending linguists to visit Native speakers around the world. After the pandemic began, TLC set up computer terminals in unused schools and community centers on reservations. While staffers control the desktops remotely, language speakers and their families can visit the stations alone and record words.

By setting up six such terminals on the Crow reservation in Montana, TLC completed a four-year effort to develop an online interactive Crow dictionary app. Similar projects are underway with tribes in Wisconsin, Washington and other states.

Meya said the strategy worked so well that TLC will continue using it after the pandemic to record Native languages in remote areas like Alaska and Australia. The nonprofit plans to offer more online lessons: Being stuck at home has led to a surge of interest among Native people in learning their historical languages, he said.

To Wetsit, the knowledge that Native Americans' culture and communities have persisted through centuries of adversity suggests they will survive this crisis.

""If you've had cultural teachings, they'll help you remember that things will get better and it gives you hope,"" he said. ""I think that our people realize that our culture can be changed a little bit without great harm. There's no wrong way to pray."""
Q&A with Elizabeth Catte and Leah Hampton: Rural America and social inequity,"Jessica DuLong is a Brooklyn-based journalist, ghostwriter, book coach and the author of ""Saved at the Seawall: Stories From the September 11 Boat Lift"" and ""My River Chronicles: Rediscovering the Work That Built America.""

Consider law enforcement's differential treatment of armed insurrectionists compared with demonstrators calling for racial equity and the end of police brutality. Take note of the race and class divisions at the heart of the rioters' discontent. The unchecked violence, looting and destruction during the siege exposed unhealed wounds that date back to the founding of the United States.

This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

CNN: You've both written about the complicated realities underlying the notion of the ""forgotten"" White working class. What does the attack on the US Capitol tell us about the dangers of that stereotype?

Leah Hampton: The danger we always have in this country is erasure. Just look at the circumstances: The danger we always have in this country is erasure. Just look at the circumstances: Two Senate seats get flipped in Georgia , specifically because of the consciousness raising and the footwork largely by women of color in the South.

Leah Hampton is author of ""F*ckface.""

Instead of that becoming the dominant conversation, the insurrection knocked the story of successful progressive organizing out of our political discussions, once again centering this toxic White supremacist identity and ideology. That's dangerous not only because the insurrection was physically dangerous to the people at the Capitol. It also diminishes attention on the reality that it wouldn't be that hard to replicate what happened in Georgia in progressive communities across the South and in red states overall.

Elizabeth Catte: Some of the danger comes directly out of Capitol attack coverage. Trash pieces like the one by Some of the danger comes directly out of Capitol attack coverage. Trash pieces like the one by Caitlin Flanagan describing the insurrectionists as arriving with ""bellies full of beer and Sausage McMuffins, maybe a little high on Adderall"" fixated on the image of a bunch of rednecks.

Elizabeth Catte is author of ""What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia.""

That kind of coverage means we have ended exactly where we started from, with this idea that this moment has been given to us by White, poor, rural people. Such stories erase complicity by upper-middle-class White people and reveal the tendency to turn up our noses at any nuanced portrayal of complicated issues of race, class and power that are actually at play here.

The reductive, monolithic hillbilly narrative sucks the life out of the work, the organizing spaces and even the imaginations of progressive people in Appalachia. The glossy magazines spout punditry claiming that bad things are happening to our democracy because pockets of ""White trash"" people across the country are behaving in antisocial ways. That is just not the case.

Hampton: Another really big danger is when White people say, ""This is not who we are."" It is who we are. It has always been who we are. Elizabeth talks in her book about the cheap stereotypes of the Scots-Irish tradition in Appalachia, designed to satisfy a ""stunningly ahistorical ... exploitative ... fetish"" of the bourgeoisie. One of the dangers of these myths is that it allows the more genteel White toxicity to feel better about itself. This narrative, as she writes, ""unburdens the white viewer from the fatigue of thinking critically about race.""

CNN: Some commentators have challenged the portrayal of rioters at the Capitol as "" Some commentators have challenged the portrayal of rioters at the Capitol as "" deplorables rising up from the muck of Rust Belt trailer parks "" driven by economic anxiety. Elizabeth has written that these characterizations are a strategic ""sleight of hand"" in which working-class people are used to ""illustrate the priorities and voting preferences"" of middle-class and affluent White people. How does that ploy function?

Hampton: All privileged people across the political spectrum profit from the economic anxiety myth, from energy CEOs — guys like All privileged people across the political spectrum profit from the economic anxiety myth, from energy CEOs — guys like Bob Murray — to the ecotourism industry and universities in the region by superficially distancing themselves from White supremacist ideology while also often preserving those same systems for their own benefit.

When you talk about who profits, you also have to think about how this country glorifies work — particularly hard physical labor by White men. We're the only country who thinks it's cool to work a 60-hour week, especially if you're White. That's culturally embedded. Meanwhile, the bourgeoisie put on the mask of the working class. I just want to point out that January 6 was a Wednesday. I don't know anybody who could take a Wednesday off work to fly to Washington for an insurrection!

A lot of people at the Capitol were wearing very expensive camouflage gear. Parked on the National Mall were a lot of bright, shiny pickup trucks that had never seen dirt.

This masking is very dangerous and it worries me, because it erases the people who actually do most of the work in this country, while centering a very narrow, heteronormative view of masculinity. That makes it super easy for all the good-hearted liberals on the coasts to dismiss rural spaces and say, ""Well, that's where the beef comes from; I don't eat beef."" I think economic interests are tied up in this really old-school heteronormative sense of masculinity, and that plus capitalism equals profit.

Catte: The tendency to blame rural places comes because Appalachia isn't actually powerful. A state like West Virginia carries just five electoral college votes. The fact is that Appalachia and other rural places tell a story that is very pleasing to capitalism: That some people are willing to die for their work. We've always had this pseudo-patriotic notion of sacrifice. It has served the military and now we extend it to police and first responders. But there is also a brutal story happening in rural places, especially with an extractive economy.

About two years ago, there was a resurgence in Appalachia of a particularly aggressive form of black lung disease. Reporters would interview people suffering and ask, ""Knowing what you know now, would you still go and work in a coal mine?"" They wanted people to say yes. And people often did say yes because that work gave them the chance to provide for their families. What they never ask these individuals is, ""If you could live in a world where coal didn't exist, would you want to live in that world?""

In this country, we seem to have a morbid need to find examples of people who happily sacrifice themselves for work. And, of course, the lives that are most valued in this country are those of White men. The magic of these two forces meeting creates a very powerful story.

CNN: During the inauguration, President Joe Biden During the inauguration, President Joe Biden called for national unity . From where you're both sitting, how likely is unity? What might make it more possible?

Hampton: Part of how you create that unity is by unifying an activist, voting force that's larger than the plurality of active White supremacists in this country. We need to increase participation of the vast majority of people in the country who, polls tell us, do not agree with what happened at the Capitol.

Leah Hampton's ""F*ckface"" explores the diverse Appalachian people and their threatened landscape.

Practically speaking, we need to make sure the census is properly counted and make sure that rural progressive organizations are funded and have grant access. In terms of enfranchisement, we need to pass voting rights bills on the national and state levels. We need to grant less attention to the grievances of White supremacists and instead dispel the myths that those grievances have any basis in reality.

Catte: The idea that we can flip a switch and be unified is absolutely ridiculous. That work is hard. We need a reorientation of perspective that helps us to see through the expeditious narratives that are so often sold to us. We need people with large platforms to do more active listening and examine the power systems. Consider what workers are trying to tell you, versus what the bosses are trying to tell you.

These blue beads found in Alaska may be the first European items in North America,"Written by Jack Guy, CNN

Christopher Columbus may have sailed the ocean blue in 1492, but some tiny blue beads beat him to it, reaching North America a few decades sooner, to become possibly the earliest European-made objects on the continent.

The beads, about the size of blueberries, were made in Venice, Italy, and found by archeologists working at three locations in northern Alaska , the University of Alaska Fairbanks said in a press release published Thursday.

The team found three beads at Punyik Point, a famous archeological site that sat on ancient trade routes from the Arctic Ocean to the Bering Sea, during digs in 2004 and 2005, along with some plant fibers.

The presence of organic matter meant they could use accelerator mass spectrometry carbon dating to find out when the plants were alive.

Study co-author Mike Kunz, an archeologist at the University of Alaska Museum of the North, said he was amazed by the results.

""We almost fell over backwards. It came back saying (the plant was alive at) some time during the 1400s. It was like, Wow!"" Kunz said in the release.

Tests on objects found near beads discovered at two other sites provided more evidence, and the archeologists think the beads arrived at Punyik Point between 1440 and 1480.

""This was the earliest that indubitably European materials show up in the New World by overland transport,"" said Kunz.

In comparison, Columbus landed in the Bahamas in 1492.

Researchers then pinpointed the provenance of the beads by studying the history of glass-making in Venice, according to the press release. These kinds of beads had never before been found west of the Rocky Mountains.

Venice maintained trade routes with civilizations throughout Asia during the 1400s, and the beads could have been taken along the Silk Road toward China before ending up in the Russian Far East, the university said.

From there, a trader may have paddled the beads across the Bering Strait in a kayak. The researchers think they were probably taken to Shashalik, an ancient trading center, before they were carried to Punyik Point.

Researchers say they may have been strung onto a necklace that was lost or left behind."
"Chevron may not be an oil-first company in 2040, CEO says","New York (CNN Business) Chevron has built a $170 billion fossil fuels empire that has made the 141-year-old company synonymous with the oil-and-gas industry.

But the climate crisis is forcing oil companies large and small to rethink their once-reliable business models.

While US oil companies have been far more reluctant than their European rivals to shift away from their cash cows , even Chevron CEO Michael Wirth concedes his company may look different in 2040.

Twenty years from now we'll be earning our profits from energy. But our company looks quite different today than it did 20 years ago,""

""Oil and gas will still be a very big part. Will it be the biggest part? Time will tell,"" Wirth told CNN Business. ""Twenty years forward there are things we are not doing today at any scale that no doubt we will be doing at a very large scale.""

Theboss pointed specifically to expansions into cleaner alternatives such as green hydrogen, renewable natural gas and carbon capture and storage.

The comments, from one of the captains of Big Oil no less, underscore the identity crisis facing the fossil fuels industry.

Chevron is not banking on solar and wind

BP BP Shell RDSA Facing political and shareholder pressure,and other European oil majors already see the writing on the wall. In recent years they've announced plans to gradually retreat from fossil fuels, slash emissions and embrace clean energy including electric vehicle charging and renewable energy.

ExxonMobil XOM its investments in shale oil and offshore drilling in Guyana. Likewise, Chevron reached a By contrast,is making a far different bet by expanding its footprint in the oil business, including acceleratingits investments in shale oil and offshore drilling in Guyana. Likewise, Chevron reached a $5 billion deal last year t o acquire oil-and-gas company Noble Energy.

Neither company has made major investments in solar and wind beyond supporting their own power needs -- and Wirth indicated that won't change.

Chevron will stay focused on areas where it can have a unique advantage. ""We're not sure wind and solar are the technologies that offer that,"" Wirth said. Plenty of companies already excel at selling solar and wind power to the electric grid, butChevron will stayfocused on areas where it can have a unique advantage. ""We're not sure wind and solar are the technologies that offer that,"" Wirth said.

'It will not go away in 20 years'

Even so, Wirth realizes Chevron may need to change to meet the times.

""Twenty years from now we'll be earning our profits from energy. But our company looks quite different today than it did 20 years ago,"" he said in the interview.

In recent years Chevron has adapted to the shifting energy landscape by expanding into new areas, including shale and liquefied natural gas (LNG), two of Chevron's most lucrative sources of revenue.

And Wirth stresses that Chevron is not saying goodbye to oil and gas. ""It will not go away in 20 years. It will still be very important,"" he said.

Heat from Washington

Still, over the next two decades, Wirth said the company could use its technical skills and financial strength to tackle big problems and invest in large, complex energy systems.

""That's what we do. Twenty years from now that's what we'll be doing,"" Wirth said. ""Those energy investments will evolve to look different from today.""

Big Oil may be forced to evolve by a combination of Wall Street and the federal government.

The oil industry has severely lagged the rest of the stock market over the past decade. While much of its underperformance is due to muted oil prices and excessive cash burn, more recent struggles can be attributed to the ESG (environmental, societal and governance) movement. Investors want to bet on companies that are viewed as part of the solution, not the problem.

""We support the president's priorities,"" Wirth said, pointing specifically to the Paris climate agreement, methane regulation and global engagement on climate change. ""We also agree that the future of energy is lower carbon.""

But some of Biden's early actions ""do raise concerns,"" he said, including the moratorium on leasing. ""These executive orders...will not reduce demand. They may simply reduce taxes and jobs.""

The White House has defended the impact on jobs by promising investments in clean energy that will create millions of union jobs.

The future of energy

Looking ahead, Wirth said Chevron plans to focus on three key areas: carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable natural gas.

All three remain very small parts of its business, and Chevron barely mentions them in its most recent annual report.

Chevron has a pair of projects in Australia and in Canada focused on carbon capture and storage, a way to trap emissions before they harm the planet.

move the needle. That's among the reasons global spending on carbon capture and storage spiked 212% in 2020, according to But current carbon-capture technologies are very expensive and much more investment is needed tomove the needle. That's among the reasons global spending on carbon capture and storage spiked 212% in 2020, according to BloombergNEF's Energy Transition Trends report.

Chevron is already in the hydrogen business through its refineries, but not in a big enough way to save the planet. However, energy companies are plowing money into carbon free hydrogen , known as green hydrogen in the hope that eventually it can power factories, cars and even planes.

""It's currently expensive and not necessarily economical,"" Wirth said. ""But there are reasons to believe that with further investments in technology and cost structures, we can make it much more competitive.""

The question is which, if any, of these bets turns into a major moneymaker for Chevron. And whether the company finds an answer to that question before it's too late."
Houston mural honoring George Floyd is unveiled in front of his high school alma mater,"(CNN) Houston, Texas, leaders unveiled a two-block mural Saturday, dedicated to George Floyd and located directly in front of his alma mater, Jack Yates High School.

""We come to celebrate the life and legacy of our hometown hero, Mr. George Floyd,"" Carl Davis, chairman for the Houston Society for Change, said during the dedication ceremony over the weekend.

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in May after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck as Floyd pleaded he couldn't breathe.

The mural in his honor was commissioned by Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis, the Houston Society for Change, and 88 C.H.U.M.P., a non-profit social activism organization that was created by Floyd's football teammates, CNN affiliate KPRC reported.

The number 88 was Floyd's number when he played football at the high school, Davis said.

Davis called Floyd's life a ""guiding light"" in the community, adding it was important the mural be placed in front of the school, ""to inspire students and give a voice to the struggle for social justice in Houston and the world.""

Brittany Torres works on the mural in front of Jack Yates High School in Houston on Saturday, February 6

In his own speech during the dedication ceremony, Ellis said it was especially important to have the unveiling during Black History Month

""It's important for all of us... to say George Floyd's name,"" Ellis said. ""But we don't stop there. The criminal justice in America and in Harris County is replete with racism, is replete with inequities and there are far too many people who look like George Floyd going to county jail who ought to be somewhere else.""

The mural was created by artist Jonah Elijah, who is also an alum of the high school, with help from other volunteers, the Houston Independent School District said in a Facebook post

According to Davis, Elijah's work is known for capturing ""Black life in America and addressing controversial issues that affect the African American community.""

After the mural was officially revealed, some of Floyd's football teammates and classmates released balloons into the air in his honor, a video posted by the school district shows.

""This is another public statement that the life and death of George Floyd is not in vain,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said.

""Because of his life and his death, reforms are being made... all over the country,"" the mayor said. ""Even right here in the city of Houston, we are learning to do things better."""
Best Super Bowl commercials 2021: View the list,"(CNN) On Super Bowl Sunday, there's one thing that matters almost just as much as the football: the commercials.

And this year, they delivered.

Though some popular brands were notably absent -- like Budweiser , which chose to donate the millions it would've spent on an ad to Covid-19 vaccine awareness -- many others still partook.

CBS reportedly charged $5.5 million for a 30-second spot, slightly less than last year but still not exactly pocket change.

Sure, watching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs was the main event. But here are the ads that we think truly made the hours-long game day even more enjoyable.

DoorDash

It was hard not to love the company's Super Bowl commercial, which served as an ode to neighborhoods everywhere. It also featured singing Sesame Street characters and Daveed Diggs. How could we resist?

General Motors

This commercial wins for sheer storytelling ingenuity. Will Ferrell stars in it as someone who hates Norway because it sells more electric vehicles per capita than the US.

The ad takes an opportunity to show off GM's new ultium battery and advocate for alternatives to gas-guzzlers, all while following Ferrell's journey to Norway, featuring cameos from Awkwafina and Kenan Thompson. With those three, this advertisement was destined to be a winner.

State Farm

This State Farm commercial, like many State Farm commercials, was star-studded -- it featured Aaron Rodgers, Paul Rudd and Patrick Mahomes (right after we'd just seen him playing!).

Then Drake showed up, introducing himself as ""Drake from State Farm."" This may be the most interested in insurance we've ever been.

Toyota

Toyota's commercial featuring American Paralympic swimmer Jessica Long is one that's sure to pull at the heartstrings. Long, a 13-time Paralympic gold medalist, shows the ""hope and strength in all of us,"" Toyota says of the ad, depicting Long's adoption story. And though we're not really sure how it's related to cars, we did feel our eyes briefly welling up.

Huggies

Babies are, obviously, incredibly cute, so they're guaranteed to win us over. The Huggies ad shows just how universally loved babies are by showing short clips of babies doing things like pooping, licking their toes and eating. In a way, Huggies had an unfair advantage. Who doesn't love babies?

Honorable mentions

-Oatly -- Sure, the CEO's singing may not have been a hit for everyone. But after airing the ad, the company gave away T-shirts (now sold out) that poked fun at the terrible-ness of the ad. That, my friends, is some good marketing.

-Cheetos -- Who among us hasn't stolen our roommate's/partner's/spouse's snacks? In this ad, Mila Kunis keeps taking Ashton Kutcher's Cheetos and honestly, we can relate."
GOP senator: 'Very unlikely' Senate votes to convict Trump in impeachment trial,"(CNN) Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said Sunday it's ""very unlikely"" the Senate votes to convict former President Donald Trump in the impeachment trial set to begin Tuesday.

""You did have 45 Republican senators vote to suggest that they didn't think it was appropriate to conduct a trial, so you can infer how likely it is that those folks will vote to convict,"" Toomey told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State on Union.""

The senator, who has said he is not going to run for reelection after his term ends in 2022, was one of five Republicans who joined Democrats in tabling an effort to force a vote on the constitutionality of the trial last month. He told Tapper that he stands by his previous remark that Trump ""committed impeachable offenses.""

""I think it is constitutional. I think it's clearly constitutional to conduct a Senate trial with respect to an impeachment. In this case the impeachment occurred prior to the President leaving office,"" Toomey said. ""I stand by everything I've said, Jake. I still think the best outcome would have been for the President to resign. Obviously he chose not to do that.""

He added that as a juror in the impeachment trial, ""I'm going to listen to the arguments on both sides and make the decision that I think is right.""

How a garage filled with dusty old machines is helping South Africa combat Covid-19,"(CNN) At first glance, veteran ventilator technician and self-professed hoarder Robin Whittle looks like any other homeowner tinkering away in his two-car garage on a sunny afternoon in Durban -- surrounded by mounds of paper, and piles of plastic and metal parts.

While most items here are destined to remain on these dusty shelves, one in particular has helped make a big impact on South Africa's fight against Covid-19.

Whittle is part of a homegrown non-profit initiative known as the South African Ventilator Emergency Project (SAVE-P). Consisting of roughly 90 volunteers ranging from engineers to medical professionals, the group was formed early last year with the goal of shoring up South Africa's supply of medical ventilators.

According to SAVE-P founder Justin Corbett, South Africa had a total of 3,800 ventilators at the start of the pandemic to cover a population of over 58 million.

By comparison, the UK, with a population of 66 million, had nearly 11,000 ventilators by mid-April; by the end of June, that number had risen to 30,000

It was part of a global scramble to acquire lifesaving equipment. But for most countries across Africa , including South Africa, obtaining medical equipment is often complicated and cost prohibitive.

As South Africa experienced its first wave of cases -- the most of any African country -- Corbett and SAVE-P decided to look inward and tap into local experts like Whittle.

Backed by the Solidarity Fund -- a network of public and private donors formed in SA as a response to the Covid-19 crisis -- the group has since produced 2,000 ventilators. All of these are currently in use in hospitals around the country as South Africa simultaneously battles a second wave of cases and the emergence of a new variant from within its own borders.

Piecing the puzzle together

Working with ventilators is in Whittle's blood. His father was a ventilator tech who owned his own business repairing medical equipment. Whittle took over at 18 and has been working with the machines ever since. He credits his collecting habit to his father, who told him that there was always a use for everything.

Today, you can ask Whittle about any one of the multitudes of metal machines stacked upon each other and he turns into a veritable museum curator, excitedly detailing the name of the machine, where it was made, if it's still in production, and what it was meant for.

SAVE-P founder Justin Corbett (left) and ventilator technician Robin Whittle (right) in Whittle's garage in Durban, South Africa.

A deeper exploration into these piles unearths everything from radios used in the 1970s and spare ventilator parts from the 1950s to old oxygen regulators. When SAVE-P reached out last March for his expertise on suitable ventilators to use as a model for its device, he knew the exact one he had to find.

""I immediately thought of the Penlon Nuffield 200 . I worked with these ventilators from the seventies and eighties,"" he says, adding ""it was a military ventilator made in the UK.""

He says he zeroed in on this particular model because it was pneumatic, meaning it could operate without electricity -- a feature that increases the ventilator's usability beyond established hospitals to include rural regions and field hospitals.

Corbett acknowledges the group took inspiration from the Penlon machine and tweaked features from the original model to make the SAVE-P CPAP 100 , a high flow CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) unit that keeps patients' airways open without obstruction.

South African ingenuity shifts into high gear

With international supply chains disrupted, South African automakers and manufacturers played a key role in making the ventilator. According to Corbett, that sector was the ideal candidate to transition into creating the parts.

""The automotive sector has the right DNA, and it's absolutely safety critical,"" he says. ""When we started looking at the documentation that we have for the automotive industry and what you require for the medical industry, the two are almost identical.""

For Pretoria-based automaker MCR Manufacturing, the transition made economic sense. Their assembly lines had gone quiet as the demand for their goods dropped during the pandemic.

""I think we just approached it as another automotive device, or just another component that we make,"" says Claudio Maccaferri, MCR CEO. ""As long as you've got the blueprint that you're working to, you can make anything. That was the hallmark of our whole cohort, where everyone was just willing to do it.""

MCR Manufacturing also collaborated with Dowclay Products and Thistledown Manufacturers to create all 500 individual parts used within the ventilator.

The challenge, says Dowclay Products owner Lionel McCaul, was to create everything from scratch. ""We had to source raw material, we had to find people who made springs, (and) we found people to make specialized seals, bearings and rubbers.""

Precision in medical grade equipment is of paramount importance. According to Whittle, being off even a hundredth of a millimeter in the milling of a piece would change the entire dynamics of the machine.

A model for the future

Probing corruption allegations , an audit by South Africa's Special Investigating Unit revealed that throughout 2020, the South African government spent $26 billion on relief efforts, of which $632 million was spent to source PPE internationally.

The ventilators made by SAVE-P cost just over $1,000, a fraction of the price of similar ventilators on the market, according to Corbett. He adds that the group also created a mobile medical oxygen machine, an integral piece of equipment that takes oxygen and air and converts it for ventilator use.

The SAVE-P project produced all 2,000 ventilators locally in South Africa.

Another South African group, Akacia Medical, has also manufactured ventilators for use within the country.

Despite the recent rise in Covid-19 cases across South Africa, Corbett says there are no plans for SAVE-P to make additional ventilators at this time, but that the warehouse stands ready and willing if asked to help.

As the second wave continues to hit, he hopes the experience of locally producing ventilators could serve as a model for the future.

For Whittle, that means looking no further than his dusty old garage.

""We know for a fact now that we can manufacture products here that don't have to be imported,"" he says. ""We have the infrastructure. We have the engineers. And if we can't buy them? We'll manufacture them ourselves."""
"New guidance might come soon for people who have been fully vaccinated for Covid-19, Fauci says","(CNN) As of now, even if you have been fully vaccinated for Covid-19 , the advice from health officials is to keep wearing your mask, keep social distancing and keep away from get-togethers.

But Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday there might be new guidance coming soon.

Fauci, the White House pandemic adviser, was speaking at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science when 91-year-old Esther Cohen asked him when she and her friends -- who all have received both vaccine shots -- can safely resume their mah-jongg games.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there is no CDC guidance on what to do when groups of people who have received both vaccine doses want to get together. Current CDC advice is to keep wearing a face covering and staying 6 feet from others when possible.

""But I believe that's going to change,"" Fauci said. ""We're talking about this at the level of the CDC.""

Vaccinations began in the United States on December 14. More than 9.5 million people have been fully vaccinated with two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data updated Monday.

The two US-authorized vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech prevent symptomatic infections in most but not all cases. And it is still unclear whether they stop asymptomatic infection.

If you are asymptomatic, you would still test positive for Covid-19, and even if you are vaccinated, you could still spread the virus. That's why the guidance now is that even the vaccinated still need to wear masks. A person could be an asymptomatic carrier and have the virus in their nasal passageways, so when they are breathing or speaking or sneezing they could still pass the novel coronavirus on to others.

Fauci said that he and his daughter, who have both been fully vaccinated, still follow the standard social distancing and quarantine guidelines before seeing each other.

""I'm doubly vaccinated. My daughter is doubly vaccinated. The last time she tried to come home, she had to go quarantine for 14 days and get tested,"" he said. ""It was a big, big deal to finally see my daughter in the same room. I think that's going to have to change.""

""What's the reason to get vaccinated in the first place, if you don't want to get to normal?"" he said.

US ramping up Covid-19 genome sequencing to track variants, CDC director says

The US has ramped up its genome sequencing efforts in the hunt for coronavirus variants, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday.

""Over the last three weeks or so we've increased our sequencing about tenfold,"" Walensky said during a White House briefing. ""So as we look more, we certainly anticipate we might find more"" variants.

The US effort in genetic sequencing lags far behind many other developed nations. One analysis ranked the US 33rd in the world for sequences per 1,000 cases of Covid-19.

Scientists search for coronavirus mutations by taking samples of the virus from patients' nasal swabs and analyzing their genetic sequences.

Mutations are changes in the genetic code of a virus that occur naturally over time when an animal or person is infected -- and such mutations can lead to the emergence of new variants.

""We anticipate that we're probably going to be sequencing up to three to four more than we are already sequencing,"" Walensky said.

""I think once we have more sequencing that's happening, we'll have a better idea as to how many variants there are and what proportion are out there.""

Walensky said during the briefing that she was ""reluctant"" to provide an estimate of how many coronavirus variant cases there could be based on the current data. She also warned that variants could reverse encouraging declines in Covid-19 statistics.

Walensky said an average of 119,900 new cases were reported between January 31 and February 6 -- a drop of nearly 20% from the prior week. New Covid-19 hospitalizations dropped about 17% from the week prior, she said.

""The continued proliferation of variants remains of great concern and is a threat that could reverse the recent positive trends we are seeing,"" she said.

Right now 699 variant cases have been confirmed across 34 states -- 690 of the variant first discovered in the United Kingdom, she said.

Experts say the highly contagious UK variant will likely soon become dominant in the US, and a new study found significant community transmission may already be occurring.

On Sunday, the US surpassed 27 million reported infections and more than 464,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than 32.3 million Americans have so far received at least their first dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, according to CDC data, as officials work to increase vaccinations across the country.

And a third vaccine could be on its way to the US market soon: Johnson & Johnson asked the Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization of its vaccine last week.

Decline in nursing home cases could be related to vaccinations

New Covid-19 cases among nursing home residents and staff have dropped more than 50% in about four weeks, according to a CNN analysis of the latest data published by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The data captured cases reported between the week ending December 20 and the week ending January 24.

A separate analysis by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living found that cases have dropped twice as fast in those nursing homes that vaccinated residents and staff.

The AHCA/NCAL analysis , published last week, assessed 797 facilities that held vaccination clinics in the federal Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program between December 18 and 27 and 1,709 facilities in the same set of counties that did not have a clinic in that time.

""The decline in new cases three weeks after the first dose, compared to facilities having vaccine clinics later, is encouraging and signals that the vaccine may decrease the spread of COVID, a finding not shown in the trials,"" said Dr. David Gifford, chief medical officer for AHCA/NCAL.

Gifford said additional data is needed to verify the reason behind the decrease.

""If verified with additional data, this could expedite the reopening of long term care facilities to visitors, which is vital to residents' health and well-being,"" he said.

Race to get people immunized

With the potential for more infectious variants to become dominant, officials are trying to get more people vaccinated quickly.

The pace of vaccinations across the United States has picked up, according to the CDC. In the past seven days, an average of more than 1.5 million people have received vaccine shots each day.

Many communities have increased the number of places people can get shots. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a plan to vaccinate seniors who are veterans of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion in their homes.

""We are inspired by folks that have been willing to stand up and fight for freedom,"" DeSantis said.

The move expands the state's program to vaccinate homebound seniors, which began recently with Holocaust survivors.

""We're not going to rest until every senior that wants a shot gets a shot,"" DeSantis said.

What it will take to reopen schools

Mitigation measures will play an especially key role in helping schools safely reopen , an expert said Sunday, as the CDC is expected to soon release guidelines on how schools can open during the pandemic.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, told CBS that when it comes to reopening schools, ""the prerequisite is putting in place mitigation steps ... ""

He noted that when people wore masks and stayed socially distant, there was ""very little transmission within the classroom.""

And while it would be good to prioritize teachers for vaccines , he said, ""I don't think it's necessarily a prerequisite. I think schools have demonstrated that they can open safely if they've taken precautions in the classroom.""

About 62,000 New York City middle school students who opted for in-person learning will be returning to the classroom February 25, according Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for the city's education department. Teachers and staff will return the day before to prepare.

Those teachers returning to the classroom are being prioritized for vaccine access at city hubs from February 12 to 21 and over midwinter recess, said Education Chancellor Richard Carranza.

First sitting member of Congress dies after contracting Covid-19

US Rep. Ron Wright has died after contracting coronavirus and being hospitalized, his congressional office said Monday.

The 67-year-old Texas Republican is the first sitting member of Congress to die after contracting Covid-19. In December, Rep.-elect Luke Letlow died after being diagnosed with the disease.

The statement from Wright's office on Monday noted that the congressman has also battled cancer. Wright had represented Texas's 6th Congressional District since January 2019."
"""Still some hope"" AstraZeneca vaccine will perform against South African variant, researcher says","Valentina Petrova/AP

There is “still some hope” that the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine could perform in people infected with the variant first identified in South Africa who are at risk of severe disease, Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at the University of the Witwatersrand said on Monday.

Early data from South Africa’s University of Witwatersrand released on Sunday suggested that two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine provide only “minimal protection” against mild and moderate Covid-19 from the B.1.351 variant.

“What the study results really tell us is that in a relatively young age demographic with very low prevalence of morbidities such as hypertension and diabetes, the (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccine does not protect against mild to moderate infection,” Madhi, who led the trial, told the BBC.

Madhi added that “extrapolating” from results seen with the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine -- which is also a viral vector vaccine -- there was “still some hope” that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could perform “as well” in different age groups at risk of severe disease.

“Now these two vaccines use a similar sort of technology,"" Madhi explained.

""They use them very, very similar in terms of the immunogenicity so I think extrapolating from that, there's still some hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine might well perform as well as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a different age group demographic that are at risk of severe disease,” he said.

Results from trials in South Africa showed Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine reduced severe disease by 89%, Madhi said.

He also said that researchers should know with more certainty “pretty soon.”

On Sunday, South African health officials said they were pausing the country's rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine after the study showed it offered reduced protection from the Covid-19 variant first identified there."
Serena and Venus Williams make dream start to Australian Open,"(CNN) The Williams sisters rolled back the years on Monday as both stormed to straight-set victories in the Australian Open first round.

Serena , 39, thrashed Laura Siegemund 6-1 6-1 shortly after her older sister Venus, 40, powered past Kirsten Flipkens 7-5 6-2.

It was a statement win for Serena who is bidding for a record-equaling 24th career grand slam title.

In truth, Serena rarely has problems with first-round matches at grand slams. She's lost just one of 77 in her long career and rarely looked troubled against Siegemund despite coming into the tournament nursing a shoulder injury.

Serena hit 16 winners and four aces to brush aside Siegemund in 56 minutes and set up a meeting with Serbia's Nina Stojanovic in the second round.

India glacier burst: Large-scale rescue operation underway in Uttarakhand,"(CNN) At least 171 people are missing and 26 have died in northern India after part of a Himalayan glacier fell into a river sending a devastating avalanche of water, dust and rocks down a mountain gorge, and crashing though a dam.

Rescue teams worked through the night to find survivors trapped under the debris. Most of the missing are workers from two hydroelectric projects in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district, which were hit by the avalanche.

Footage from Sunday's disaster shows a fast-moving wall of water and rocks barreling down a narrow gorge and smashing through a dam at the smaller hydroelectric project before surging downstream, wiping out buildings trees and people.

Ashok Kumar, Uttarakhand's police chief, told CNN on Monday that 26 bodies had been recovered in the affected region. He said a further 171 people were still missing, including 35 workers who are believed to be trapped inside a tunnel at the larger, state-owned hydroelectric project.

Some 2,500 people in 13 villages were initially cut off by the flash floods sparked by the glacier's collapse, Ashok Kumar, senior official with the Uttarakhand police said Monday.

Rescuers had reached all 13 villages by Monday afternoon and relief work is now underway in them, Kumar said.

Meanwhile, rescue efforts are focused on clearing sludge and debris from the tunnel where the 35 workers are thought to be trapped. Rescuers managed to clear the mouth of the tunnel on Monday, according to a Twitter post from the Uttarakhand State Press Information Bureau.

The mouth of the tunnel was cleared by Indian Army personnel on Monday, according to the Uttarakhand State Press Information Bureau.

The bureau hailed the ""tireless efforts of Indian Army personnel,"" adding that relief operations in the area were still underway.

According to Reuters, teams had managed to drill through 150 meters of the 2.5 km (1.5 miles) long tunnel, but the sheer volume of debris had slowed progress.

On Sunday, rescuers pulled 12 people out alive from another, smaller tunnel at the same site, according to Kumar.

Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel take part in rescue efforts at the hydro power project at Reni village in ​​Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, February, 8, 2021.

The ecologically sensitive Himalayan region is prone to flash floods and landslides. Himalayan glaciers are also vulnerable to rising global temperatures because of man-made climate change.

As the ice melts, glaciers become unstable and start to retreat. Large glacial lakes can form, and when parts of the glacier in front of it break away they unleash the water trapped behind it causing an outburst of floods. A 2019 study found that Himalayan glaciers are melting twice as fast as last century, losing almost half a meter of ice each year.

This photograph from the National Disaster Response Force shows NDRF personnel rescuing workers at one of the hydropower projects at Reni village in Chamoli district.

Others have pointed to a high level of construction along the state's rivers, which in recent years have seen an increasing number of hydroelectric dams, projects and infrastructure connecting them, such as roads and new developments.

While environmentalists have long warned that rampant development in the Himalayan state is an ecological catastrophe waiting to happen, authorities described Sunday's landslide as a freak event.

""This was a one-time incident. The glacier broke, and with ... debris all came down and flooded the power project here,"" said Kumar, the Uttarakhand police official.

Sunday's floods brought back memories of a similar devastating incident in 2013, when the state was hit by what was dubbed by the area's chief minister as a ""Himalayan tsunami."" Nearly 6,000 people lost their lives in those floods, according to Reuters.

Rescue operations continued Monday near the Dhauliganga hydro power project after a portion of Nanda Devi glacier broke off, in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India.

Widespread damage

Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said at a press conference Sunday that ""Uttarakhand has witnessed a terrible disaster"" and the state was expecting ""significant loss to human lives and infrastructure.""

It was after 10 a.m. local time when a piece of the Nanda Devi glacier broke apart, sending torrents of water down the Dhauli Ganga river valley located more than 500 km (310 miles) north of New Delhi, according to authorities.

Most of the destruction was centered on two hydropower projects. The Rishiganga Power project -- a small dam of 13.2 megawatts -- was completely washed away in the deluge, India's Ministry of Power said in a statement Monday.

The state's chief minister said 35 people were working at the plant when the waters hit, and ""roughly 29 to 30 people are missing."" Rising waters prompted authorities to issue urgent evacuation notices to people living further down the Alaknanda River.

A handout photo from the State Disaster Response Force shows rescue operation near the Dhauliganga hydro power project in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand.

As flash floods surged down the valley, they caused extensive damage to a second and much larger 520 megawatt hydro project under construction about 5 kilometers away from the other project. Some 176 laborers were working on the Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower project site, which has two tunnels, and is state-owned by NTPC, India's largest power utility.

More than 30 workers could be stuck in the second tunnel, he warned. Rescuers are battling to reach them but the surrounding road is covered in debris.

A witness told Reuters that the avalanche of dust, rock and water came without warning.

""It came very fast, there was no time to alert anyone,"" Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of the river in Raini village in Uttarakhand, told Reuters by phone. ""I felt that even we would be swept away.""

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a message of support in the wake of the disaster. ""Am constantly monitoring the unfortunate situation in Uttarakhand,"" he tweeted.

""India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone's safety there. Have been continuously speaking to senior authorities and getting updates on NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) deployment, rescue work and relief operations.""

Avalanche was a 'climate event,' expert says

While experts say it is too early to conclude exactly what led to Sunday's avalanche, they have said human-induced global warming is certainly at play.

Dr. Ankal Prakash, Research Director at Indian School of Business' Bharti Institute of Public Policy, said ""it looks like a climate change event.""

""The prima facie evidence we are seeing is that it's because of the glacial decline and melting because of global warming,"" said Prakash, who was author on the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's landmark report on the Ocean and Cryosphere

The 2019 report, Prakash said, documented how ""climate change has altered the region to an extent that the frequency and magnitude of natural disasters will increase.""

The remains of the dam along the river in Tapovan on February 8.

The area where the avalanche and flooding occurred is extremely remote and mountainous and it can take days to reach some of the villages dotted throughout the valleys, according to Prakash.

These places ""need basic facilities such as infrastructure, water, roads, and sanitation,"" Prakash said, adding that ""we need development here because they are some of the poorest areas.""

However, discussion should focus on what kind of development and projects are built, and to assess how damaging they could be to the environment, he said."
Millions who likely voted for Trump want him barred from future office,"(CNN) It is common that many politicians grow more popular once they leave office. That has not been the case for former President Donald Trump.

On the eve of his impeachment trial in front of the Senate , new polling reveals that more Americans want him convicted than at any point during his first impeachment trial a year ago.

More amazingly, more want Trump barred from holding national office ever again than had even an unfavorable rating of any president after one term in office.

A new ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday shows that 56% of Americans are in favor of the Senate convicting Trump and barring him from holding federal office in the future. Just 43% are opposed to such an action.

This is merely the latest poll to find a clear plurality for such a measure, even after Trump left office. A Monmouth University poll taken at the end of January indicated that 57% wanted him barred from holding federal office and 52% wanted him convicted by the Senate.

Every single poll over the last month that I could find that meets CNN standards for reporting has shown that at least 56% of Americans want him to be barred from holding or seeking (depending on the question) federal office again.

That is, to put it mildly, a stunning percentage. At no point last year in the polling between Trump and now-President Joe Biden did Biden ever earn anywhere close to 56% in the national average

This means that there are likely millions of Americans who voted for Trump last year who now want him barred from holding federal office.

Indeed, while about 80% of Republicans (depending on the polling) don't want Trump being kept from running for or holding federal office, this still indicates a clear drop in support from last year. Trump won more than 90% of self-identified Republicans in last fall's election

Overall, this type of opposition to a sitting or former president after one term is historic. No other president after one term in polling history ever had an unfavorable rating or disapproval rating north of 50% . On the much harsher being barred from office question, Trump is above that milestone.

When it comes to conviction specifically, there seems to a slightly smaller majority in favor of such an action. An average of 51% of Americans in live interview polls taken since January 20 are in favor. A minority of 43% oppose this. This 8-point difference has basically stayed the same over the last month.

When the Senate acquitted Trump after his first impeachment trial in 2020, the gap between supporting and opposing impeachment was 4 points. It never got as high as the 8 points it is right now.

For a historical comparison, no other president, except for Richard Nixon, has ever had a majority of Americans say he should be impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. It was only weeks before Nixon resigned that a clear majority believed he should be impeached and removed from office.

Of course, Trump's not likely to be convicted (or barred from running for federal office) because his support from Republicans, though down, is still north of 80% when it comes to the Senate acquitting him. Republicans have 50 seats in the Senate and 67 votes are needed for conviction.

But Trump's likely acquittal should not be mistaken for support among the larger electorate.

The bottom line is Trump remains quite unpopular and a lot of Americans want no part of him."
Reddit really did run a Super Bowl ad -- and it referenced when its users disrupted Wall Street,"(CNN Business) No, it wasn't a glitch — for some Super Bowl viewers, a Reddit commercial really did pop up on the screen.

The spot, which was just five seconds, opened as if it were a car commercial, but then quickly then flashed to Reddit's orange and white logo, which was followed by a message.

""If you're reading this, it means our bets paid off,"" the message read. ""One thing we learned from our communities last week is that underdogs can accomplish just about anything when we come together around a common area.""

Reddit's Superbowl ad aired for about five seconds during the big game on Sunday, February 7, 2021.

The spot comes after a Reddit army — from the WallStreetBets page — took on Wall Street pros by inflating the share price of GameStop . The mass buying spree led to huge gains for some in the Reddit crowd who got in early. Hedge funds, meanwhile, lost billions of dollars on their short positions.

""Who knows, maybe you'll be the reason finance textbooks have to add a chapter on 'tendies,'"" the Reddit ad read. ""Powerful things happen when people rally around something they really care about. And there's a place for that. It's called Reddit.""

China arrests Australian TV host on suspicion of spying,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) An Australian employee of China's state broadcaster CGTN has been arrested on suspicion of ""illegally supplying state secrets overseas,"" Canberra said Monday.

""Chinese authorities have advised that Ms Cheng was arrested on suspicion of illegally supplying state secrets overseas,"" Payne said, adding that ""the Australian Government has raised its serious concerns about Ms Cheng's detention regularly at senior levels, including about her welfare and conditions of detention.""

Cheng was a business anchor on CGTN, the international arm of China's state-owned broadcaster CCTV, which has since scrubbed all reference to her from its website and social media.

According to a profile of her that has now been deleted, the Australian journalist joined the Beijing-based broadcaster in 2012, following a nine-year stint with the US financial news network CNBC. She was one of CGTN's top anchors, helming the daily ""Global Business"" show, conducting high-profile interviews, as well as driving ""content innovation"" and taking part in special projects.

In her spare time, Cheng was active in the Australian community in Beijing, taking part in events at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and acting as an ""alumni ambassador"" for the country's embassy.

Her final post on WeChat, the Chinese social networking app, showed her at the opening of a Shake Shack outlet in Beijing on August 12, the first restaurant opened in China by the US chain. Posing in a bright green dress, Cheng captioned the photos with the hashtag ""make shakes not war.""

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin confirmed Cheng's arrest and asked Australia to ""stop interfering.""

""The Chinese judicial organs handle the case in accordance with the law and fully guarantee the rights of Cheng Lei,"" Wang said Monday. ""We hope that the Australian side will respect China's judicial sovereignty and stop interfering with China in handling cases according to law.""

Cheng's original detention came amid rapidly worsening ties between Canberra and Beijing. After Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, China targeted it over trade, slapping products with tariffs and blocking acquisitions by Australian companies.

Soon after Cheng was detained, two Australian journalists working in China fled the country after authorities attempted to question them on national security grounds, leaving Australia's media without any journalists working in China for the first time in nearly 50 years.

Bill Birtles, Beijing correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), and Mike Smith, Shanghai correspondent for the Australian Financial Review (AFR), were told they were ""persons of interest in an investigation"" into Cheng. Both sought the protection of consular officials, and were eventually able to fly out of China after a five-day diplomatic standoff.

In an exclusive report Monday , Birtles quoted family members of Cheng in Australia as saying they were unaware of any reason why she might have been detained.

""I don't think she would have done anything to harm national security in any way intentionally,"" Louisa Wen, Cheng's niece and spokeswoman for the family, told the ABC. ""We don't know if she's just been caught up in something that she herself didn't realize."""
More than 150 missing and 14 dead as burst glacier triggers flash floods in India,"(CNN) At least 14 people are dead and more than 150 missing after a glacier burst in India's northern Uttarakhand state Sunday and crashed through two hydroelectric projects, triggering deadly flash floods along the river.

Footage of the disaster showed a fast-moving avalanche of dust, rock and water barreling through the narrow gorge in Chamoli district, in the Himalayan state, and sweeping away parts of a dam as well as buildings, trees and people in its path. Those living further down the river were urged to evacuate from the rising waters.

Rescue teams worked throughout the night to find survivors and recover bodies. Fifteen people trapped in a tunnel were rescued on Monday, according to Chamoli District Police, though rescuers are now focusing on a second tunnel which is blocked with debris.

Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said at a press conference Sunday that a tunnel at the state-owned NTPC hydro project was clogged with debris from the avalanche triggered by the glacial burst.

""Uttarakhand has witnessed a terrible disaster,"" Rawat said, adding that the state is expecting ""significant loss to human lives and infrastructure.""

"Democratic Republic of the Congo reports new Ebola case, months after end of its last outbreak","(CNN) A woman has contracted Ebola and died in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), marking the first case since the Central African country ended its last outbreak last year, the health ministry said on Sunday.

The woman was found with symptoms of the virus in the town of Biena, near the city of Butembo, on February 1, and died in hospital on February 3. She was married to a man who had contracted the virus in a previous outbreak.

""The provincial response team is already hard at work. It will be supported by the national response team which will visit Butembo shortly,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Trump's second impeachment trial set to kick off this week amid questions about what it will look like,"(CNN) The second Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump is scheduled to kick off Tuesday with some of the key questions about the trial itself -- including how long it will go and whether any witnesses will be called -- still unanswered.

The ultimate outcome of the trial does not appear to be in doubt: Trump will be acquitted by the Senate for the second time, falling well short of the two-thirds votes needed for conviction.

But that doesn't mean the next week -- and possibly two -- will be without drama as the House impeachment managers recount the destruction caused in the deadly January 6 riot and argue that Trump was the one who incited the insurrectionists to ransack the US Capitol.

House Democrats on Thursday sought testimony from Trump himself at the trial, a move that was swiftly rejected by Trump's legal team. Democrats are unlikely to subpoena the former President and risk a drawn-out legal battle, feeling they can make their case that he incited the rioters without his testimony, just as they swiftly impeached him for ""incitement of insurrection"" one week after the January 6 riots.

But the Democrats' brief trial balloon that Trump should testify underscores the logistical hurdles that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell still have to navigate for the first step of the trial: its rules.

Senate wants a speedy trial

Schumer and McConnell and their aides have been engaged in extensive discussions about the trial's organizing resolution, which the Senate will pass before arguments begin. Unlike last year's trial, both sides hope to reach a bipartisan agreement on the trial's parameters, which will include how long the impeachment managers and defense team get to make their arguments, how witnesses could be called and other matters.

There's reason for bipartisan optimism in the Senate -- when it comes to logistics at least -- because both sides are seeking a speedy trial. While the House impeachment managers are eyeing a proceeding that could last up to two weeks, some Senate Democrats are pushing for a quicker time frame.

The reason is simple. Senate Democrats are diving into their effort to pass President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan , a high-wire act that will require every Senate Democrat to stay on board. Plus, Biden still has a slate of nominees that needs to get confirmed by the Senate. And none of that can happen on the floor until the trial is done.

While Republicans are in no rush to confirm Biden's Cabinet, they also don't have a desire for the public to remain fixated on the events of January 6 -- and on the former President -- in a lengthy trial.

The expectation on all sides is that Trump's second impeachment trial will be shorter than the first, which lasted three weeks. Just how much shorter is still being negotiated.

Schumer's office said Saturday night that the Senate will accommodate a request from one of Trump's impeachment attorneys, David Schoen, to halt the trial during the Jewish Sabbath.

This would mean the trial would be suspended at sundown Friday and potentially not reconvene until Sunday.

""We respect their request and of course will accommodate it. Conversations with the relevant parties about the structure of the trial continue,"" said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer.

There would need to be an agreement among senators to hold the trial on a Sunday. The New York Times first reported on the development.

As the Senate president pro tempore -- the longest-serving senator of the majority party -- Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, is presiding over Trump's impeachment trial in lieu of Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts, who oversaw Trump's first impeachment trial, chose not to oversee the proceedings -- because Trump is no longer in office, Schumer has said.

GOP senators preview trial vote

When Sen. Rand Paul forced a vote on the constitutionality of Trump's impeachment trial last month -- arguing it was unconstitutional to convict a former President -- only five Republicans joined all the Democrats to kill the Kentucky Republican's motion.

It was a telling vote since Democrats will need at least 17 Republican senators to vote to convict Trump and bar him from running for future office.

Many Democrats and Republicans alike have pointed to the vote on Paul's point of order as an indicator for how the trial's final vote will likely land. And Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell sided with Paul in the vote -- suggesting his initial signals that he might be open to convicting Trump are not likely to result in him voting that way.

Trump's defense team will likely use this exact argument next week to defend the former President.

In a 14-page response to the House's impeachment effort on Tuesday, Trump's lawyers, Bruce Castor and David Schoen , previewed their argument that the Senate cannot vote to impeach Trump when he no longer holds office, as well as that Trump's speech about the election and before the January 6 riots did not cause the riots and was protected by the First Amendment.

""The constitutional provision requires that a person actually hold office to be impeached. Since the 45th President is no longer 'President,' the clause 'shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for ...' is impossible for the Senate to accomplish,"" Trump's team wrote.

The House impeachment managers pushed back on that point, writing there is precedent to hold a trial and convict Trump, who was impeached by the House last month while he was still in office.

""There is no 'January Exception' to impeachment or any other provision of the Constitution,"" the managers wrote. ""A president must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last.""

'A Senate of courage or cowardice'

The House impeachment managers haven't made a final decision on whether they will call witnesses for the trial. They're preparing for the possibility they won't have any witnesses -- but they may decide to use them if they find a witness willing to voluntarily step forward, according to sources.

The managers want to avoid any kind of court fight over witnesses like the House had to deal with during the first impeachment of Trump, which would delay the trial further.

Even without witnesses, Democrats are preparing to use evidence from video and social media to help illustrate how Trump's words, actions and tweets incited the rioters to attack the Capitol.

The trial is sure to be compelling. While Republicans are relying on a procedural argument as reason to dismiss the impeachment charge against Trump -- avoiding a judgment on his conduct -- the House's presentation will catapult senators -- and the public -- back to the harrowing events of January 6 when senators were forced to flee the chamber.

For Democrats, the trial is likely to be as much about holding Trump and the Republican lawmakers who pushed his false claims of election fraud accountable in the public eye than it is the all-but-impossible task of flipping 17 Republican votes.

""In the court of the Senate, they will make their case. And in the court of public opinion, they will make their case,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at her weekly news conference Thursday.

""And for history and posterity, as our founders said, to ourselves and our posterity, they will make the case. But I have great confidence in them, and we'll see. We'll see if it's going to be a Senate of courage or cowardice."""
Biden says he won't lift sanctions on Iran to bring country back to negotiating table,"(CNN) President Joe Biden said the US will not lift sanctions to get Iran back to the negotiating table, suggesting the measure would only happen if Tehran stops enriching uranium.

""No,"" Biden said when asked by CBS' Norah O'Donnell if he would make the move to start negotiations, nodding when she asked in an interview released Sunday if the country must stop enriching uranium first.

These comments appeared to mark the sharpest public response from the President on Tehran since taking office and continue a stalemate between the two countries.

On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki refuted that Biden's nod amounted to a policy change from the President.

""Well, just to be very clear, the President never said that, exactly -- it was stated by the interviewer ... and he didn't respond to the question,"" Psaki said, when asked if this was a non-negotiable point for the president.

Pushed back by a reporter that Biden did appear to nod affirmatively in the clip after O'Donnell's question, Psaki said: ""I think if we were announcing a major policy change, we would do it in a different way than a slight head nod.""

In the past, the President has said the US will rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, once Tehran fully complies again with the pact

Psaki affirmed that policy again during her Monday briefing.

""Overall, his position remains exactly what it has been, which is that if Iran comes into full compliance with its obligations under the JCPOA, the United States would do the same. And then use that as a platform to build a larger and stronger agreement that also addresses other areas of concern. Now it would of course be done with our P5+1 partners as it was done when we were putting together the JCPOA in the first place,"" she said.

Iran's position is that because the US left the agreement in 2018, Washington should make the first move by removing the crippling sanctions former President Donald Trump liberally imposed on Iran's leaders, on individuals and the economy, and for terrorism. Iran has increasingly breached its obligations under the nuclear deal after the Trump administration withdrew the US from it.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Sunday the US ""must lift all sanctions"" if it wants Tehran to return to the deal. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that the US is the one who needs to return to the pact and that Iran never left it.

""It is very clear, it was the United States that left the deal. It was the United States that violated the deal. It was the United States that punished any country that remained respectful and compliant with the deal,"" Zarif said on ""GPS."" ""It is for the United States to return to the deal to implement its obligations. Iran never left the deal.""

Tehran's Parliament passed legislation on December 2 that requires significant increases in its nuclear activities at regular intervals if Iran's demands for sanctions relief, including on its banking and oil sectors, are not met.

Tehran announced in January that it had resumed enriching uranium up to 20% purity , far beyond the limits laid out in the 2015 nuclear deal.

Nuclear officials have also increased enrichment capacity at the Natanz facility. And on Monday, Iran aired video footage of what it claimed was the ""most powerful"" rocket engine using a system that could launch long-range missiles capable of endangering US allies in Europe and the Middle East or the US itself.

There have been a flurry of behind-the-scenes actions the Biden administration has taken, including building a team with varying viewpoints on Tehran and reaching out to lawmakers.

On Friday, the National Security Council hosted a meeting to discuss the country's growing nuclear enrichment, part of an ongoing policy review. Psaki confirmed it on Twitter and said it wouldn't produce any decisions.

""The meeting today is part of an ongoing policy review. It is not decisional,"" Psaki wrote Friday. ""There are no pending policy announcements. We will consult broadly with Congress and partners before any decisions are taken.""

Talks on the escalation in Tehran are also happening between allies, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at a briefing Thursday. He said the US is engaged in talks with European Union allies on a strategy toward Iran and believes it will produce a ""unified front.""

""We are actively engaged with the European Union right now, particularly the three members of the P5+1; Germany, the UK and France. We are talking to them at various levels of our government, those consultations, I think will produce a unified front when it comes to our strategy towards Iran and towards dealing with diplomacy around the nuclear file, and I just don't want to get ahead of where that's going to end up,"" Sullivan said.

Biden has discussed Iran with foreign leaders since taking office, according to readouts provided by the White House.

Zarif, when speaking to CNN's Zakaria Sunday before the President's comments on Iran were released, said Biden had two choices.

""Now it's clear, it's a decision that President Biden and his advisers need to take,"" he said. ""Whether they want to break with the policies of President Trump or whether they want to build on his failures. If they want to build on his failures, they only will only get failure as a result.""

"More contagious coronavirus variant identified in UK is spreading rapidly throughout the US, study says","(CNN) A new study finds that cases of a more contagious coronavirus variant are rapidly increasing in the United States, and significant community transmission may already be occurring.

Although the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the UK is currently at a relatively low frequency in the United States, the paper says it's doubling every week and a half, similar to what was observed in other countries. The report estimates this variant is 35-45% more transmissible than strains that appeared earlier in the United States, and it's doubling about every 10 days in the country.

Last month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modeling predicted the B.1.1.7 variant could become the predominant strain in the United States by March. It estimates the virus is about 50% more transmissible.

""Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality,"" researchers wrote in the study's preprint, which has not yet been peer-reviewed or published.

In addition to groups of cases in California, Florida and Georgia, many B.1.1.7 cases in the United States did not report recent international travel, the report said, suggesting ""significant community transmission of the B.1.1.7 variant is already ongoing across the U.S.""

Read inaugural poet Amanda Gorman's Super Bowl poem,"(CNN) For Amanda Gorman, Inauguration Day was just the beginning. Now, she can cross the Super Bowl off her bucket list, too.

Gorman, who performed her poetry at President Joe Biden's inauguration last month, was back Sunday evening. This time, though, the youth poet laureate was honoring educator Trimaine Davis, ICU nurse manager Suzie Dorner and veteran James Martin -- all named ""Honorary Captains"" ahead of the game for their leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic.

A video of Gorman performing her poem, ""Chorus of the Captains,"" was played ahead of the three heroes' introduction on-field. The young poet has seen immense success in recent weeks following her inaugural poem, having been signed with IMG models just days later, as well as interviewed by Michelle Obama for Time Magazine.

Here's her poem from Sunday evening:

Facebook vowed to crack down on Covid-19 vaccine misinformation but misleading posts remain easy to find,"(CNN Business) Nearly two months into the largest vaccine rollout in US history, Instagram continued to prominently feature anti-vaccination accounts in its search results, while Facebook groups railing against vaccines remained easy to find.

Facebook has for years grappled with addressing anti-vaxxer content. Late last year, it established new rules to tackle Covid-19 vaccine misinformation after pledging two years ago to reduce the spread of anti-vaxxer content. But misleading and fearmongering content about the Covid vaccines, as well as outright misinformation, continues to spread on the platform at a time when the stakes couldn't be higher: misinformation about the vaccine can mean life or death.

Four of the top 10 search results for ""vaccine"" on Facebook-owned Instagram were for anti-vaccination accounts, including ""vaccinetruth,"" ""vaccinefreedom,"" ""antivaxxknowthefacts,"" and ""cv19vaccinereactions,"" according to a series of searches conducted by CNN Business from multiple different Instagram handles beginning two weeks ago.

Shortly after, Instagram updated its search interface on mobile devices to showcase three credible results, including the CDC's account, followed by a ""See More Results"" prompt. Users who click on that option are then shown a number of anti-vaccination accounts, in what is arguably the digital equivalent to shoving the mess in a bedroom under the bed.

Some of those accounts have amassed sizable followings, raising the question of whether Instagram suggesting them as a top result for users simply seeking out vaccine information helped them grow an audience. The ""cv19vaccinereactions"" account, which is devoted to documenting claims of adverse reactions to the vaccine, boasts more than 77,000 followers. The account often shares unsubstantiated reports and insinuates unproven links between people getting the Covid-19 vaccine and major health events, including a stroke or a miscarriage.

South Africa pauses AstraZeneca vaccine rollout after study shows it offers less protection against variant,"(CNN) South African health officials said Sunday they're pausing the country's rollout of AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine after a study showed it offered reduced protection from the Covid-19 variant first identified there.

During a briefing on Sunday, South Africa Minister of Health Dr. Zweli Mkhize said the hold would be temporary while scientists figure out how to most effectively deploy the AstraZeneca vaccine. Mkhize said South Africa will move forward with the deployment of vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson

Early data released Sunday suggest two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine provided only ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate Covid-19 from the variant first identified in South Africa.

The study, which has not been released, included about 2,000 volunteers who were an average of 31 years old; about half received the vaccine and half received a placebo, which does nothing.

Viral neutralization against the B.1.351 variant was ""substantially reduced"" when compared to the earlier coronavirus strain, researchers said in a news release . The vaccine's efficacy against severe Covid-19, hospitalization and death were not assessed.

"Pressley: 'We have been cleaning up after violent, White supremacist mobs for generations and it must end'","(CNN) Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley has called on the country ""to address the evil and scourge that is White supremacy,"" one month after pro-Donald Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol.

""One of the images that I'm haunted by is the Black custodial staff cleaning up the mess left by that violent White supremacist mob,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, reflecting on her experience on Capitol Hill during the deadly siege on January 6.

""That is a metaphor for America. We have been cleaning up after violent, White supremacist mobs for generations and it must end.""

Flags, signs and symbols of racist, White supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with Trump 2020 banners and American flags during the insurrection last month. It took such a ""harrowing and traumatic"" event, Pressley told Tapper, for many Americans to begin to recognize the threat of White supremacy

The congresswoman's comments come as the Senate is poised this week to hear arguments in Trump's impeachment trial, where the chamber will consider whether to convict or acquit him on a single charge of ""incitement of insurrection."" While the former President is expected to be acquitted for the second time, Pressley called on her colleagues in Congress to hold Trump accountable

"How to watch the Super Bowl live: Start time, channels and other things to know","(CNN) Fluff up your favorite recliner and get ready to drown the piercing shriek of reality in a warm bowl of nacho cheese: It's Super Bowl time again! Yes, you cannot get rid of the Super Bowl. It's scientifically impossible. When the world as we know it is reduced to ashes, all that's left will be cockroaches and the Lombardi Trophy.

And Tom Brady, of course.

Here's everything you need to know about this year's game so you can immerse yourself in the momentary illusion that everything is fine and the only thing to worry about is what potato chip ad will pop up next.

What time is the Super Bowl and how can I watch it?

Super Bowl LV (that's 55 for you non-Romans) will kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, February 7.

It will be broadcast live on CBS. You can also stream the game on CBSSports.com, the CBS Sports app, or other streaming devices like Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Hulu and any device that supports CBS All Access.

Where is the Super Bowl being played?

A view of Raymond James Stadium where Super Bowl LV will be held on February 7.

This year's championship is being held in Tampa, Florida, at Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The stadium is also known as ""Ray Jay,"" and sources tell us fans actually do call it that! We thought it would be like ""Hotlanta,"" where if you actually said it they'd laugh you out of the city.

What teams are playing in the Super Bowl?

""No, YOUR red uniforms are brighter!""

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be playing the Kansas City Chiefs in a garish red-on-red matchup that's sure to shave the top layer of your cornea clear off. If you have colorblind vision, this one may prove difficult. The game will be historic because it's the first time a team will be playing in its home stadium for the Super Bowl. (Super Bowl host cities are decided years in advance and have nothing to do with the actual fate of the teams from a given season.)

Does the stadium have a boat in it?

AHOY

It does! Well, technically it's a ship. (Technically technically it's a non-functioning replica attraction.) The pirate ship at Raymond James Stadium fires off cannons whenever the Buccaneers do a good job in the game. Of all of the Florida sports things, this feels like one of the Florida-iest. (Second to the beautifully deranged home run statue at Marlins Park in Miami , which was temporarily removed but returned to the outfield last year. Yes, the dinger fish is back!)

Don't the Tampa Bay Rays have a tank full of actual rays in their baseball park? That also feels pretty Florida.

What players should I know about?

Patrick Mahomes, left, and Tom Brady

One of the big storylines this year will be of crabbed age and youth. They cannot play together. Youth is full of pleasance. Age is full of wheat grass and mindfulness incantations.

In the role of crabbed age, we have Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady, who is 43 (normal in human years, ancient in football years). Youth will be played by Patrick Mahomes, the 25-year-old quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes is also the guy from the State Farm commercials, and Brady is the figure that looms at the foot of your bed whenever you have a night terror.

Wasn't Tom Brady on the Patriots?

Funny story! Brady ended his historic run as Patriots QB last season, and then signed on with the Buccaneers . Oh, what a laugh we all had! Moving to Florida? Typical retiree behavior! It's not that the Buccaneers were bad, per se, but they weren't the Patriots.

But just like that, they're headed to the Super Bowl, and their New England expatriate looks like he's Benjamin Buttoning harder than ever. Who's laughing now? Not Tom Brady. That would disrupt his chi. The only people laughing are the folks that operate those pirate ship cannons, and whoever thought up the unforgivable Bucs pun, ""Tompa Bay.""

Are there any other players I should know about?

The Tampa Bay Gronkineers

Don't worry! Brady didn't have to make the move to Florida alone. The Tampa Bay brass gifted him an Emotional Support Gronk. Rob Gronkowski, tight end and longtime New England teammate of Brady's, came out of retirement specifically to don the red and pewter and take a shot at another championship with his buddy. Now THAT's friendship.

Who's going to win?

Currently, Kansas City is favored by most books , but only by about three points -- one measly field goal. So it's bound to be a tight matchup. (Of course, once you say that, a blowout is all but ensured.)

What's the deal with the Super Bowl halftime show?

What if The Weeknd's Super Bowl halftime show set just looked like a postgame press conference dais?

The Weeknd will be headlining the halftime show, and there's all kinds of speculation over what the vibe of the event will be. After all, the stadium will have only about 25,000 people in it thanks to the pandemic, and there probably won't be any screaming and carrying on.

A PepsiCo marketing official promises the show will be "" unlike anything we've seen on the halftime show before ."" Will the Weeknd sit cross-legged and bust out an acoustic set? Will he do interpretive dance? Maybe it will be like a ""Super Bowl Home Companion."" The anticipation is nearly unbearable.

How about the ads?

Go ahead, take a look!

Football fans are definitely looking forward to this matchup. Young buck against old Buc! Super Bowl Champion against, well, Super Bowl Champion! There's really no way to lose. That's another fun fact to ruminate on: This Super Bowl pits the last two Super Bowl Champions together. So no matter who wins, the victor will be racking up multiple rings, and the loser can go hug their most recent Lombardi Trophy for comfort.

I'm interested. But I don't want to just be interested, I want to be ENAMORED. Which team's logo is more likely to seduce me with a single look?

Definitely Tampa Bay. No, not the skull holding the football! (Unless you're into that.) It's Bucco Bruce, the old Tampa Bay logo, that will really get you.

Oh, hi. ;)

The Kansas City Chiefs are returning to the Super Bowl -- and so is the controversy over the team's name,"(CNN) The Kansas City Chiefs are back for another Super Bowl. And inevitably, so is the longstanding controversy over the NFL team's name and Native American imagery.

The racial justice movement that was reignited last summer prompted a number of professional sports teams to re-examine their names, mascots and other fan traditions. Washington's football team got rid of the slur in its name. Cleveland's MLB franchise announced it would drop ""Indians"" from its name once it settled on new branding.

The Chiefs had their own reckoning.

In August 2020, the NFL team announced it would ban fans from wearing ceremonial headdresses and Native American-style face paint in the team's stadium. But they stopped short of changing their name or prohibiting fans' use of the tomahawk chop, saying that leadership was reviewing the pregame tradition.

The Chiefs said the moves were born out of six years of dialogue with a group of tribal leaders. But for many Native activists, the changes -- while significant -- didn't go far enough. Super Bowl LV will be another reminder of the harm and offense they've long felt.

""Racism is going to have a global stage on Sunday,"" said Crystal Echo-Hawk, founder and executive director of IllumiNative , an advocacy group that works to increase the visibility of Native people.

As the Chiefs take the field in Tampa, Florida, while the world looks on, here's where the conversation stands -- and why activists say change is long overdue.

How the Chiefs got their name

The Chiefs are named for former Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle , a White man who impersonated Native American culture.

Before becoming mayor, Bartle was actively involved in leadership of the Boy Scouts of America. In 1925, he created the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, a scouting organization that drew on Native American heritage and customs.

Bartle was not a Native American, but claimed he was ""inducted into a local tribute of the Arapaho people,"" according to Mohawk journalist Vincent Schilling. Bartle was called ""Lone Bear,"" and later came to be colloquially known as ""Chief.""

Kansas City Chiefs fan displays are seen in downtown Kansas City ahead of Super Bowl LV on February 01, 2021.

Nearly 40 years later, Bartle served two terms as mayor of Kansas City and helped bring the Dallas Texans football team there. The team was eventually renamed the Chiefs in Bartle's honor.

The name may seem innocuous. But for Echo-Hawk, the problem is not just the name but the culture of Native appropriation and mockery that flows from it.

""It's this ecosystem that it creates of bigotry and hate,"" she said. ""It's the culture in which fans engage in.""

There's the Chief's home of Arrowhead Stadium. The pregame beating of the drum. The horse mascot named Warpaint. And of course, the tomahawk chop and the accompanying faux war chant.

The team has made some changes

Activists say the references dehumanize Native people. And they want them gone.

""When names like the Chiefs are used, it makes that culture a stereotype,"" said Kate Finn, executive director of First Peoples Worldwide. ""It confines it to a caricature that really doesn't express the fullness of Indigenous peoples' culture.""

Not In Our Honor, a coalition that advocates against the use of Native American imagery in sports, has long been calling on the Chiefs to change their name and cease use of any Native symbols. In collaboration with other local and national groups, they recently rented two billboards in Kansas City to amplify that message.

""Change the name and stop the chop,"" the billboards read.

A billboard calling the Kansas City Chiefs to change their name and end the ""chop"" stands along Interstate 70 in Missouri on February 3, 2021.

The Chiefs did not respond to multiple interview requests for this story.

The team has said they are engaged in dialogue with a group of tribal leaders around issues of cultural sensitivity. Since 2014, the Chiefs have invited tribe members to participate in an annual American Indian Heritage Month game, which includes rituals such as a ""Blessing of the Drum"" and a ""Blessing of the Four Directions.""

At the height of racial justice protests last year, the team took some steps to address concerns. They banned headdresses and Native American face paint and had cheerleaders perform the chop with a closed fist instead of an open palm. They also said they were considering changes to the beating of the drum and reviewing the tomahawk chop.

Camilla Chouteau, tribal council secretary for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, joined the Chiefs' American Indian community working group in November.

Personally, she says it would be helpful if the Chiefs changed the song that accompanies the chop, though she hasn't discussed that with the team's leadership. But she doesn't find the other rituals offensive, and says she's encouraged by the Chiefs' openness to their suggestions.

""Change is hard, and getting fans to change behavior takes time,"" Chouteau said.

But activists say those efforts fall short

For many others, the Chiefs' efforts so far have fallen flat.

Gaylene Crouser, executive director of the Kansas City Indian Center and a member of the Not In Our Honor coalition, said the Chiefs' continued use of their name and Native imagery is made all the more insulting given the NFL's recent rhetoric around fighting systemic racism.

The NFL committed $250 million over the next 10 years to fight systemic racism. To further demonstrate that commitment, the league also stenciled two slogans on each team's end zones all season: ""End Racism"" and ""It Takes All Of Us.""

The Chiefs play on a field with the words ""End Racism"" stenciled into the end zone.

For Crouser, as long as the appropriation of Native culture and traditions is allowed to stand, the gestures remain hollow.

""They dial back the blatant racism because they know it's harmful,"" she said, of the changes the team has made over the years. ""But they don't want to actually change.""

Finn agreed.

""Racism is the use of these names, logos, mascots and condoning this fan behavior,"" she said. ""If you're going to make a statement decrying racism, then you need to make a statement to decrying these other things as well.""

Others are pressuring the Chiefs, too

The damaging effects of Native appropriation in sports have been well documented.

In 2005, the American Psychological Association published a resolution calling for the retirement of mascots, symbols and images featuring Natives, citing a body of research that shows such caricatures have negative mental health consequences for Native people.

The National Congress of American Indians called for the end of racism in sports and Native sports mascots in a report published in 2013, saying that such imagery perpetuates the idea that Native people are ""frozen in history.""

""If we're a cartoon, how are we going to take seriously tribal sovereignty and water rights and missing and murdered Indigenous women and all these things that need to be addressed and we're still working on?"" asked Crouser.

The Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans players meet on the field during a moment of unity before an NFL football game on September 10, 2020.

With that in mind, advocacy groups are ramping up the pressure on the Chiefs.

Thousands of people have signed the online petition . In addition to the billboards in Kansas City, the Not In Our Honor coalition has hired a plane to fly near the stadium throughout the weekend displaying the ""Change the Name, Stop the Chop"" message. And the Florida Indigenous Rights and Environmental Equality Organization is leading a protest Sunday outside the stadium where the Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will play.

""Native peoples have been organizing to eliminate racist sports mascots for decades,"" said Echo-Hawk. ""We're not going to tire.""

The Chiefs' hometown newspaper has echoed those calls, too.

""There is no glory in being the last holdout clinging to traditions and symbols that are now viewed as insensitive or even racist,"" the Kansas City Star editorial board wrote in December of last year. "" And as other teams have taken action, it has become increasingly apparent that the Chiefs are delaying the inevitable.""

The decisions made by Washington's NFL team and Cleveland's MLB team to change their names have shown that teams can bring fans together in ways that don't cause harm or offense to Native people, activists say.

So instead of holding on to symbols and traditions that are widely considered disrespectful, the Chiefs should consider this a chance to attract more Native fans and make their franchise inclusive, Finn said.

""This is a moment where the NFL can apply their zero tolerance for on-field use of racial slurs to all races and ethnic groups, especially Native people,"" she said. ""There's a real opportunity there for them to step up and to really be forward in their commitment to end racism."""
"Democrats unveil $3,000 child benefit as part of Biden relief package","(CNN) House Democratic leaders unveiled legislation Monday that would give millions of families at least $3,000 per child, advancing a key provision in President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.

Rep. Richard Neal, who is leading the crafting of the legislation for the stimulus package as the Ways and Means Committee chairman, introduced the enhanced Child Tax Credit bill

""The pandemic is driving families deeper and deeper into poverty, and it's devastating. We are making the Child Tax Credit more generous, more accessible, and by paying it out monthly, this money is going to be the difference in a roof over someone's head or food on their table,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement provided to CNN.

CNN obtained a copy of the 22-page bill Sunday. The Washington Post first reported on it.

The legislation would provide $3,600 per child under the age of six and $3,000 per child age six through 17 for a single year. The full benefit is available to single parents earning up to $75,000 annually and for couples earning up to $150,000. Payments would phase out after those thresholds.

Black people in history: Little-known figures to know,"Although racism and fate kept him from the major leagues, Josh Gibson was one of the most dominant sluggers in baseball history.

The former Negro Leagues star is credited with hitting almost 800 home runs over his 17-year career and was such a fearsome hitter that many fans called him the “black Babe Ruth.” Some who saw both play even called Ruth the “white Josh Gibson.”

Because of incomplete statistics, many of Gibson’s legendary feats – like hitting a ball 580 feet at Yankee Stadium – are just that, the stuff of legends.

Even his origin story is larger than life. He was reportedly a spectator at a Homestead Grays game in Pittsburgh in 1930 when the catcher hurt his hand. Gibson, already a semi-pro player, was invited to come down from the stands and replace him.

He never looked back. Gibson ultimately became the second-highest-paid player in the Negro Leagues behind another legend, Satchel Paige.

“You look for his weakness and while you’re lookin’ for it, he’s liable to hit 45 home runs,” Paige once famously said of Gibson. Renowned player and coach Buck O’Neil called him “the best hitter that I’ve ever seen.”

Unfortunately, Gibson never got a chance to play in the majors. He died of a stroke at 35 in 1947, less than three months before Jackie Robinson made his debut for the Brooklyn Dodgers and broke baseball’s color barrier."
Nissan's 'office pod' imagines a new kind of remote working,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Forget working from home -- this camper van is for those who want to ""work from anywhere.""

Inspired by the new realities of the Covid-19 era, Nissan's concept vehicle features a retractable office for remote workers and digital nomads. Dubbed Office Pod Concept, the mobile workspace comes with a modified Cosm chair by US furniture-maker Herman Miller, and desk space big enough for a large computer monitor.

Those seeking privacy can set up inside the pod with the doors closed. Ambient lighting gives the office a futuristic feel, while electric shades help deter prying eyes.

But, with the tap of an app, the pod extends out the back in a matter of seconds (as shown in a promotional video ), and the trunk door becomes a cover for your al-fresco office. The vehicle's rooftop also doubles up as a space to relax under a parasol.

The concept vehicle is a modified version of Nissan's NV350 Caravan, which hit the market in 2012 and currently retails in Japan from 2.3 million to 4 million yen ($22,000 to $38,000).

The rooftop space can be accessed from inside the vehicle. Credit: Nissan

It was created for this year's Tokyo Auto Salon, though -- with Japan's capital currently in a state of emergency amid surging Covid-19 cases -- the unveiling was staged virtually.

Other features include a glove box fitted with a ""UV antibacterial lamp,"" which Nissan said can disinfect personal items like wallets and phones. Elsewhere, a floor made from transparent polycarbonate allows you to see what is happening beneath the vehicle.

""For the past year, (the) coronavirus pandemic has significantly accelerated the work-from-home trend and many office workers are now having a variety of issues working home,"" Nissan explained in press materials shared with CNN. ""Nissan wants to solve these issues by giving those workers more choice of where and how they work.""

The concept design is based on Nissan's NV350 Caravan series. Credit: Nissan

While Nissan has no plans to sell the design on the mass market, the carmaker said it is considering making some of the individual modified parts available to customers."
"Inmates at St. Louis jail attack corrections officer, set fires in their unit","(CNN) About 115 inmates at a St. Louis jail escaped their cells, broke windows and set small fires in their unit on Saturday, officials said.

The disturbance at the City Justice Center began around 2:30 a.m. when a ""defiant detainee"" got into a scuffle with a corrections officer, St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards said at a news briefing.

The officer was then ""jumped by others that were detained inside one of our units,"" Edwards said.

Some inmates were able to ""jimmy the locks"" to escape their cells, Edwards said, noting that the locks were a long-standing problem.

As the injured corrections officer was removed from the unit, inmates who left their cells had access to the automated lock panel and were able to release others in the unit, Edwards said.

This Utah man invited homeless people to live in his front yard,"(CNN) Less than five minutes' drive from downtown Salt Lake City sits the quiet neighborhood of Fairpark. The area hosts an annual state fair, a regional campus of Utah State University and modest homes with small yards.

On one of those yards sits a random group of tents where people experiencing homelessness have set up camp. They are there at the invitation of homeowner Darin Mann. He lets the people camp on his tidy third of an acre, use a bathroom in his house and volunteer at a community garden Mann runs at a nearby public park.

Tents in the front yard

""The goal is to de-stigmatize how people view homelessness,"" Mann explains. ""Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and helped when they need it.""

The local activist opened up his impromptu tent area, dubbed ""Village Camp,"" in mid-January. Some 15 people live there right now. Mann tells CNN that the residents came from other camps in Salt Lake City that were shut down.

A Black sheriff's deputy in Louisiana condemned police brutality and institutionalized racism. Then he died by suicide,"(CNN) A Louisiana sheriff's deputy died by suicide on Monday after recording and posting to social media videos of himself condemning institutionalized racism and describing his struggle as a Black law enforcement officer in a system that he says condones police brutality against Black people.

Lafayette Parish Deputy Clyde Kerr III, 43, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to a preliminary coroner's report. He was outside the Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office, according to Capt. John Mowell.

Kerr became a deputy in 2015, Mowell said.

He was a New Orleans native, Army veteran and father of two boys.

In the videos posted online, he spoke about the police killings of Black Americans such as Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and George Floyd in Minneapolis -- which sparked nationwide protests last summer against police brutality and racial injustice.

""I've had enough of all of this nonsense, serving a system that does not give a damn about me or people like me,"" Kerr said in one video, speaking directly to the camera. ""You have no idea how hard it is to put a uniform on in this day and age with everything that's going on.""

CNN has confirmed Kerr's identity in the videos with Michael Robinson, who described Kerr as one of his closest friends. Kerr filmed two videos on January 29 and a final one on January 31. All three were posted to his YouTube account just hours before his death, according to Robinson.

In his last video, Kerr described himself as a ""stellar"" deputy who dedicated his life to the service of others. He also called for additional mental health resources for police officers, including more frequent psychiatric evaluations.

""This is my protest against police brutality and everything else that comes along with it in this broken, wicked, worldly system that does not give a damn about people,"" the deputy said.

Kerr, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq as a soldier, was a school resource officer at St. Genevieve Elementary School and St. Genevieve Middle School in Lafayette.

Robinson said he met Kerr in 1995 as they were moving into their dorms at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where the deputy studied criminal justice.

""He just loved being an officer,"" Robinson said. ""He just didn't like some of the things behind the scenes, such as practices that needed to change for the better. He had great ideas about what could be done to make it better and heal the relationship with the public.""

Robinson told CNN that the death of Floyd last May weighed heavily on Kerr. He confided in Robinson last summer about a difficult conversation he had with his teenage son, who watched the widely circulated video of Floyd's killing.

""He told me that he thought about resigning just because of how everything was, and I told him if he did that in this climate, I don't think anybody could fault him for it,"" Robinson said. ""But I said, 'Man, those kids would really miss you.' That's basically the reason he was still there.""

In a statement to CNN, the Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office said they are ""heartbroken"" from the loss of Kerr, who ""took his own life earlier this week and left behind so many friends and coworkers who cared for him deeply. Our thoughts and prayers are with Deputy Kerr's family, as we all struggle to process this together.""

Biden administration moves to terminate Trump-era migration agreements,"(CNN) Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Saturday that the Biden administration has suspended and begun the process to terminate Trump-era migration agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

The United States signed agreements with Guatemala in July 2019 and with El Salvador and Honduras in September 2019 that would have limited the ability of some asylum seekers from those countries to claim asylum in the US and would instead have had them seek protection in their countries of origin.

Blinken noted in his statement that ""transfers under the U.S.-Guatemala Asylum Cooperative Agreement had been paused since mid-March 2020 due to COVID-19, and the Agreements with El Salvador and Honduras were never implemented.""

The top US diplomat called the move to suspend the Asylum Cooperative Agreements with the three Northern Triangle nations ""the first concrete steps on the path to greater partnership and collaboration in the region laid out by President (Joe) Biden .""

""In line with the President's vision , we have notified the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras that the United States is taking this action as efforts to establish a cooperative, mutually respectful approach to managing migration across the region begin,"" Blinken said in a statement.

Kroger to pay workers $100 if they get the Covid-19 vaccine,"(CNN) Kroger has joined a growing list of large US grocery store chains offering incentives for workers to get the Covid-19 vaccine.

The company announced that its associates would get a one-time $100 payment if they show proof that they've received the full manufacturer-recommended doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. Workers that can't get the vaccine for health or religious reasons can get the payment if they take an educational health and safety course, the company said in a news release

""We know that the most effective defense against this pandemic comes in the form of the COVID-19 vaccine and the continuation of the rigorous safety precautions we've established across our stores, manufacturing facilities and supply chain,"" said Dr. Marc Watkins, Kroger's chief medical officer in the statement. ""We are strongly encouraging all customers and associates to receive the vaccine to curb the spread of COVID-19, and we'll do all we can to ensure they have access as soon as it's available.""

The Kroger Co. ( KR ) operates grocery stores under a number of names in 35 states.

The company said it would also spend an additional $50 million to thank and reward its associates, including a $100 store credit and 1,000 fuel points to its hourly front line grocery, supply chain, manufacturing, pharmacy and call center associates."
2 men who appeared on Netflix's 'Cheer' accused of separate sex crimes involving minors,"(CNN) Two men who appeared on the Netflix docuseries ""Cheer"" have been arrested and charged in separate sex crime cases involving minors, authorities said.

The arrests on Wednesday of Mitchell Ryan and Robert Joseph Scianna came nearly five months after federal prosecutors in Chicago accused ""Cheer"" star Jeremiah ""Jerry"" Harris of ""enticing an underage boy to produce sexually explicit videos and photos of himself."" He was later indicted on additional charges.

The ""Cheer"" docuseries follows the cheerleading squad from Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas. The series debuted on Netflix in January 2020.

Ryan, 23, was arrested by police in Coppell, Texas, on a charge of aggravated sexual assault of a child on July 24, according to Dallas County Sheriff's Department records.

Details of the case were not immediately available. CNN has reached out to police and prosecutors for additional information.

Regional foods celebrating every team that made the playoffs this year,"(CNN) As a Pittsburgher by birth, I've got a lot of hometown pride. (Just ask anyone who's ever met me.) I love Heinz Ketchup, the Pirates, the Steelers, the Penguins, Mister Rogers, Andy Warhol — and our city's famous Primanti Bros. sandwiches.

And I was really looking forward to making my homemade version of a Primanti's sandwich while I watched the Steelers in the Super Bowl this year.

Well, that didn't happen, but I refuse to let the disappointing end to the Steelers' season get me down. I'm going ahead with my plan to chow down on Primanti's while watching Kansas City and Tampa Bay go head-to-head on Sunday.

Call it sports self-care: Even if your team got shut out, you can still have a winning night with your menu. Here's a list of regional foods celebrating every team that made the playoffs this year. Soothe yourself by snacking on a hometown favorite and remember — there is always next year.

Kansas City, Missouri: BBQ ribs and brisket

Thick, sweet and tangy are the hallmarks of the Kansas City style of barbecue sauce, slathered on everything including slow-smoked pork ribs, brisket and burnt ends. This tomato- and molasses-based sauce is one of the American classics.

Tampa Bay, Florida: Cuban sandwiches

Tampa is one of three Florida cities (along with Key West and Miami) that calls itself the American birthplace of the Cuban sandwich. But Tampa's version of the hearty pressed pork sandwich stands apart with one special addition: sliced Genoa salami.

Make a Tampa-style Cuban sandwich at home like they do at the city's famous Columbia Restaurant. Substitute a crusty oblong roll for the Cuban bread and stack with ham, roast pork, Swiss cheese, yellow mustard and dill pickle slices.

Buffalo, New York: wings

This Super Bowl favorite is a beloved bar food all over the country these days. There is no denying, however, that Buffalo is the city that put chicken wings on the map. Pay homage with a basket of crispy, saucy drumsticks and flats with a side of celery sticks.

Just make sure your wings are dripping with the simple, spicy sauce that makes any wing, whether deep-fried or oven-roasted, a Buffalo wing. Frank's RedHot is the hot sauce of choice, whisked with melted butter.

Green Bay, Wisconsin: fried cheese curds

There is no wrong way to eat cheese. But cheeseheads of the Midwest know there is a really wonderful way to eat it, and that's as fried cheese curds. Made with the squeaky, unaged curds that are part of the cheesemaking process, these fresh dairy bites are the pride of Wisconsin.

Cleveland: Slyman's corned beef

A mile-high pile of corned beef is the signature sandwich at Slyman's Restaurant , which has been slapping these teetering towers together since 1964. Each sandwich contains at least 3/4 pound meat between rye bread, so get your toothpicks ready if you're re-creating this beast.

Add a slice of American cheese to do it the Slyman's way, or if you want to combine two Cleveland institutions in one, sneak on a squirt of brown mustard — either Bertram Original Ball Park or Stadium brand.

New Orleans: muffuletta and king cake

In the indulgent spirit of New Orleans, why choose between sweet and savory? Have both with two delicacies that are big enough to serve the whole family. Muffuletta (or muffaletta) fills a round bread loaf with three kinds of meat and two types of cheese, along with pickled peppers and olive spread to balance it out.

And since it's almost Fat Tuesday, it's the season for king cake , the colorful Danish-style pastry filled with cream cheese or cinnamon and a plastic baby somewhere in there for luck. If buying or making an entire king cake is too much, make king cake doughnuts

Los Angeles: street tacos

A city as diverse as Los Angeles has as many iconic foods as ZIP codes, but for game-watching, avocado toast is off the table (but I love it) and Dodger Dogs should be saved for baseball season.

Instead, make street tacos inspired by the many taco stands, taquerias and trucks throughout the city. Both filling and topping options are endless, but why not try Instant Pot birria (spicy stewed beef) or pork al pastor

Fill small warmed corn tortillas with meat and top with chopped white onion, fresh cilantro and a few dashes of hot sauce or a squeeze of a lime wedge.

Baltimore: Berger cookies

Is it a cake or a cookie? Eating one of Baltimore's regionally famous Berger cookies makes you wonder if it's a little bit of both. Soft, fluffy sugar cookies, almost like mini cake rounds, are topped with a rich, fudgy brownie-style frosting. They're a Charm City classic.

You can buy the original cookies from Berger's bakery, which uses the same recipe from 1835, or make a homemade version

Pittsburgh: Primanti Bros. sandwiches

Whether you pick capicola, the Pitts-burger (the ""#2 Best Seller"" on the menu), kielbasa or even tuna salad, it's the tangy vinegar coleslaw and fresh skin-on french fries in every Primanti Bros. sandwich that make it one of Pittsburgh's most famous foods.

This Steel City icon is easy to make at home with fresh Italian bread, tomatoes, provolone and that coleslaw . (Oh, and the No. 1 bestseller at Primanti's? It's beer!)

Tennessee: hot chicken

Nashville takes fried chicken to new levels with its famous hot chicken, originating in renowned Black community restaurants like Hattie B's and Prince's Hot Chicken Shack. Marinated in hot sauce and buttermilk, then dredged in a spicy flour blend and fried, then coated in a hot and sweet sauce, it's not for the faint of heart.

Feeling spicy? Make your own hot chicken from scratch with this recipe

Chicago: deep dish pizza

The City of Big Shoulders has a big reputation when it comes to deep dish, with pizza purveyors like Lou Malnati's, Gino's East and Giordano's all attracting devoted fans. The crisp and flaky crust is the key to cradling thick layers of molten cheese, chunky tomato sauce and sausage in each wedge.

Make it at home and grab a knife and fork for the first few bites. A high-sided cake pan works as a substitute for a deep dish pizza pan.

Seattle: salmon sushi

The fish might be restricted to flying curbside at Pike Place Market these days, but it just goes to show that in the Pacific Northwest, salmon is still king. And while you can grill it, smoke it, poach it or sauté it, salmon sushi is much easier to eat in front of the TV.

If you're feeling ambitious, you can try your hand at rolling your own sushi , or just order your favorite salmon-based maki roll for snacking.

Washington: oysters

The Chesapeake waterways surrounding Washington, DC, have historically been a popular breeding ground for oysters, resulting in the longstanding "" oyster wars "" of the region. Today's oyster farmers are more peaceable and offer a number of varieties that can be shipped to your door.

Indianapolis: pork tenderloin sandwich

A Hoosier standard, a pork tenderloin sandwich is simple but satisfying. Pork loin is pounded to a thin disc, then breaded and panfried. The craggy, golden tenderloin stretches beyond the bun for a challenging first (and second) bite.

"Super Bowl LV will be unlike any other (except, of course, for Tom Brady)","(CNN) Super Bowl LV will be more than a battle between two of the premier quarterbacks in the National Football League .

The crown jewel of American sports will be played Sunday at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, which, like many sporting venues around the country, has been doubling as a coronavirus testing site during the pandemic -- a stark reminder this will be no ordinary Super Sunday.

In fact, the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers will cap an extraordinary NFL season that saw 262 players and 463 coaches and other personnel test positive for the coronavirus, players and teams sanctioned for violating pandemic protocols, and games reshuffled after outbreaks.

""This was an extraordinary collective effort,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. ""There were so many people that had to work together to get this done. There were doubters, obviously. There were people that didn't believe we could do it. Obviously, we had a lot of unknowns ourselves... We had to adapt at every stage just like everybody else.""

Not a single game was canceled.

""Those were some anxious days,"" Goodell said of dealing with the pandemic during the 16-game regular season. ""There's no question about it.""

Here are five ways Super Bowl LV will be unlike any other:

The number of spectators is limited

Unlike previous Super Bowls, Raymond James Stadium won't be filled to capacity.

The last time the Super Bowl was played at Raymond James Stadium, in 2009, there were 70,774 fans in the stands as the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Arizona Cardinals.

The NFL has said health care workers will be recognized with tributes in the stadium and during the broadcast on CBS.

""These dedicated health care workers continue to put their own lives at risk to serve others, and we owe them our ongoing gratitude. We hope in a small way that this initiative will inspire our country and recognize these true American heroes,"" Goodell said.

Fans will receive a giveaway for the pandemic era: Free PPE kits, including masks, wipes and hand sanitizer.

One team has the home field advantage

Tom Brady is playing in his 10th Super Bowl but his first one with Tampa Bay -- and its a home game no less.

Tampa Bay, led by 43-year-old quarterback Tom Brady, will be the first team to host a Super Bowl in their stadium.

""A home Super Bowl for the first time in NFL history, I think, puts a lot of cool things in perspective,"" said Brady, who will be making a record 10th career Super Bowl appearance. ""Any time you're the first time doing something, it's usually a pretty good thing.""

Brady is in his first year with the Buccaneers after 20 seasons -- and six Super Bowl victories -- with the New England Patriots.

It will be Tampa Bay's second title game since winning Super Bowl XXXVII against the then-Oakland Raiders in San Diego, California, to end the 2002 season.

The Chiefs, led by 25-year-old Patrick Mahomes, look to become the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since Brady and the Patriots did it in 2003 and 2004.

A woman will officiate

Sarah Thomas will make history as the first female official at the Super Bowl.

Sarah Thomas will become the first woman to be part of the officiating crew for a Super Bowl game. She will be the down judge in the crew of eight officials.

""Her elite performance and commitment to excellence has earned her the right to officiate the Super Bowl,"" NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations Troy Vincent Sr., said in a statement last month.

At the time of her appointment to the NFL in 2015, Thomas said she was honored to be considered a ""trail blazer"" but stressed that her focus was on ""being the best official I can be.""

""I've just been doing this truly because I love it,"" she said. ""The guys don't think of me as a female, they see me as just another official.""

Expect a different kind of halftime show

The Weeknd says he will keep the halftime show ""PG for the families.""

The Weeknd, the Canadian musician whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, will perform during a halftime musical show that will take place in different parts of the stadium.

The singer did not reveal specifics at a Thursday news conference.

""You have to watch Sunday,"" he said.

Known for sometimes graphic music videos, The Weeknd said he will keep the show ""PG for the families"" and promised to be ""respectful to the viewers.""

Watching at home, tone it down

The pandemic has meant that everything surrounding the big game -- from the accompanying parties to the TV commercials -- has been either toned down, scaled back or gone virtual.

The same goes for watching the Super Bowl at home.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is asking people to forego the big house viewing parties. Instead, the CDC advises, watch the game at home with the people you live with.

""Attending large gatherings including the Super Bowl increases your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19,"" according to the guidance posted on the CDC's website.

Those who insist on having a small watch party should host it outdoors and make sure everyone has a mask, according to the CDC. The guidance recommends limiting alcohol consumption because alcohol may make you less likely to follow Covid-19 safety measures.

""Use a projector screen to broadcast the game. Sit at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with,"" the CDC said.

And avoid chanting or cheering, as both can hurl viral particles into the air. ""Stomp, clap, or bring hand-held noisemakers instead,"" the CDC said.

Goodell agreed.

""We want our fans to be safe,"" he told reporters Thursday. ""They need to be smart. They need to wear their PPE. They need to be gathering in small groups. We worked with the CDC about their advice ... about staying at home and doing it with family and household members and we believe that's the way it should happen.""

The commissioner added, ""We're all going to enjoy the Super Bowl a little different this year."""
"Chicago orders some teachers to resume in-person classes next week, setting up showdown with union","(CNN) Chicago may be closer to a teacher strike after Chicago Public Schools ordered some teachers back to work in person Monday.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools said they had made their ""last, best, and final offer"" after a slew of meetings with union representatives. The Chicago Teachers Union responded that the leaders had ""walked away from the bargain table again.""

CPS and the City of Chicago have been negotiating with the teachers union for weeks about returning to in-person learning during the pandemic . The union has maintained it is not yet safe.

The revised plan CPS sent to teachers Friday night included a new proposed return schedule, with pre-K and special needs teachers and staff expected to return Monday and students returning Tuesday.

Lightfoot and CPS Chief Executive Janice Jackson told teachers in a letter Friday night that any teacher who didn't show up for work Monday would be shut out of the schools' online systems.

Netflix's 'Bridgerton' is leading a romance novel renaissance,"(CNN) There's no question that ""Bridgerton,"" the saucy Regency-era ""Netflix"" series, has hit iconic status. In a few short weeks since its December 2020 release, it's become the most popular show in the platform's history and secured a shoo-in second season . It's also courted legions of devoted followers who delight in the show's frothy, yet culturally au courant portrayal of a bygone British era (and abs. They also like the abs).

The show has also been a big boon for romance novel lovers.

""Bridgerton"" is based on a series of books by romance author Julia Quinn , and its popularity has rocketed the books back on to bestseller lists, sparking new interest in a complex and extremely influential genre.

Much like Netflix's ""The Queen's Gambit"" inspired more interest in the game of chess , the time seems ripe for a ""Bridgerton effect,"" a moment that changes the landscape of the romance industry like ""The Notebook,"" ""50 Shades of Gray"" and other influential works have done in the past.

But what it will change, and who will stand to benefit, is a story that's yet to be written.

Uncertain times have turned everyone into a romantic

""Romance is having a moment. It's trendy to swoon,"" Tessa Dare, a bestselling author of historical romance , tells CNN. She says it's been thrilling to watch ""Bridgerton"" become a worldwide phenomenon and prove what millions of romance readers already know: These kinds of stories are for everyone.

""Love, sex, and relationships are universally compelling themes,"" Dare says.

They're also profitable ones. A spokeswoman from Avon, the imprint that publishes the ""Bridgerton"" novels, told CNN sales of the original eight ""Bridgerton"" books ""have increased exponentially since the premiere of the show.""

The eight books in the original ""Bridgerton"" series by Julia Quinn.

It's no surprise that such ultra-romantic, ultra-sensual stuff is topping bestseller lists and breaking streaming records. In fact, it's just business as usual.

""Romance is the genre that funds the rest of publishing. That's the honest truth,"" says award- winning contemporary and paranormal romance author Suleikha Snyder . ""Romance holds up the rest of the publishing industry while also empowering readers emotionally.""

""The past year has been so difficult for everyone. Collectively, we needed a mass infusion of joy,"" Dare says. ""If the world can agree on nothing else, at least 63 million households can celebrate the Duke of Hastings' perfectly arched eyebrow.""

""Bridgerton"" could woo new romance readers

Despite being a thriving and evolving genre, outsiders often view romance novels with disdain. Every time a series like ""Bridgerton"" gains a cultural foothold, some of that stigma falls away. The effect can be a win-win, attracting more readers to the romance fold, and emboldening longtime fans, who may have hid their passion, to share more about the genre they love.

""Growing up, we had that image of cheesy novels you pick up at the grocery store, and people have held on to that idea"" says Roni Loren, a bestselling contemporary romance author . ""Seeing the popularity of 'Bridgerton' legitimizes the genre to some people. It gives people permission to start checking out things in the romance novel section.""

Phoebe Dynevor as Daphne Bridgerton and Regé-Jean Page as Simon, the Duke of Hastings in ""Bridgerton.""

Why, exactly, romance writers and readers continue to contend with these assumptions is a thorny question.

""Sexism,"" Tessa Dare says, simply. ""Society is primed to view anything produced by women for women as lesser, and there's always been an assumption that romance is frivolous, poorly written, and holds little appeal for men. Bridgerton's success is proving all those assumptions false.""

Just like in the books, there are parts of the ""Bridgerton"" show that are, ahem, spicy to say the least. (Episode 6. It's Episode 6. You're welcome.) There's even some actual bodice-ripping. And much has been written about how the series, like most romance novels, is formed purely from the female gaze : The women are best friends, family, rivals and sharp schemers. The men, though complex in their own way, are everything someone could want in a partner: Caring, witty, respectful, and well, very hot.

Across social media, people are having fun posting their reactions to some of the steamier scenes -- sometimes with nothing more than a knowing face or a few verklempt little noises

""I watch 'Bridgerton' for the plot,"" another popular meme says , followed by various photos of the sexy male leads, labeled: ""The plot.""

How often do women get something like this, of sexual and emotional enjoyment especially tailored for them? Through generations of Playboy covers, Michael Bay movies and male-dominated media , romance novels have provided just that: A haven for women to explore their sexuality, their agency, and what it means to be loved and desired.

That kind of value can't be tagged with a dollar sign, and when social media is alight with people joking and sharing their saucy romance opinions, it's not just boosting a bottom line. It's revealing the genre's true impact, and inviting others to bask in the softly-lit glow.

New eyes on romance puts inclusivity in the spotlight

However, that glow doesn't shine evenly on all experiences, and when it comes to inclusivity, ""Bridgerton"" occupies a curious spot. From the outset, the show captured attention because of its diverse cast, including a Black leading man, a Black queen, and people of color in all kinds of roles, big and small. This is a departure from Quinn's novels, which give no indication of race and, like so many Regency-era novels, are set against the very white background of 19th century London high society.

Golda Rosheuvel as Queen Charlotte in ""Bridgerton""

So while ""Bridgerton,"" the TV series, provides an inclusive experience to its fans, that level of representation doesn't carry over into the romance world as it stands. While there are sparks of new interest in the industry, writers are hopeful that the show's success will prompt readers to explore a wider range of romance stories.

""We welcome new readers via 'Bridgerton' with open arms,"" Suliekha Snyder says. ""But the sticking point with the 'rising tide lifts all boats' philosophy is that sometimes it only lifts certain boats.""

""Will these new people only gravitate toward white Regency-era romance? Or will opening a Julia Quinn book and realizing the Duke is actually white make them seek out more diverse and inclusive books, thus widening the net?""

When Snyder, who is South Asian, got into romance writing, she noticed a lot of books in the genre fetishized and othered South Asian people. That drove her to write stories with characters of South Asian heritage.

Snyder cautions against viewing this level of ""diversity"" in publishing as some sort of option, or a way to fill a special bookshelf at the store. It is, she points out, simply reality.

""Diversity and inclusivity isn't just an educational tool. It's our lives. It's how we love,"" she says. ""And that's part of the struggle we've had over the past several decades. Just having to remind people that [authors of color] exist and are real and that our books have just as much mass appeal as a white author's.""

Speaking of mass appeal, ""Bridgerton"" the TV show has also raised tantalizing questions about the popularity of inclusive media.

""I don't think of it as whether the show helps push the diversity conversation in romance forward,"" says author Alyssa Cole. ""But whether it wasn't the other way around""

In short, it has been a common assumption that stories like these don't sell.

But, Cole posits, the truth laid out by Bridgerton's success, and the future it may invite, are more promising.

""At this point we've seen multiple romance adaptations with Black characters and characters of color added—would these shows have been as successful without a diverse cast?"" she asks. ""And if diversity is integral to an adaptation's success, why not adapt more books from authors of color?""

In romance, everyone deserves a happy ending

Regé-Jean Page as Simon, the Duke of Hastings and Phoebe Dynevor as Daphne Bridgerton in ""Bridgerton.""

If there really is going to be a ""Bridgerton effect"" in the romance industry, it's clear it has to be one that boosts writers and readers of all backgrounds. After all, the unifying theme of romance -- whether you're into werewolves, cybersex, Scots in kilts or women in stays -- is that everyone deserves a happy ending.

""I think that's where the importance of inclusion is, having this space to safely navigate our identities while knowing it will end in a happily-ever-after,"" Snyder says. ""Queer readers, readers of color ... when we're reflected in the pages, we get to see our happily-ever-afters normalized. And that's radical. It shouldn't be. It should be commonplace. But we're not there yet, unfortunately.""

These are the things to remember the next time someone dismisses romance as frivolous. Yes, there's sex. Yes, there is fun and escapism. And those things warrant no apologies.

But romance means more to people than that.

""It's very feminist. In a lot of romances, the woman is saving themselves. It's so pro consent -- it's our fantasy, that we want to be treated with respect,"" Roni Loren says.

Cole says another big draw is trust. ""Characters are often guarded due to past trauma. Part of their story is learning to trust someone, and that trust not being a mistake,"" she says.

""One of the greatest fantasies is that you can show yourself -- all of yourself, including the bad stuff -- to a partner or friend, and trust that they will still love you. In a romance, that trust is always rewarded at the end.""

When readers open a romance novel, they trust that something of themselves is going to be reflected in those pages, no matter who they are, who they love, or how they live.

And if a very sexy, very profitable Netflix show can pave the way for more of these stories to be told, then bring on the love."
A student athlete sparked national change after being disqualified from a volleyball match for wearing a hijab,"(CNN) US high school volleyball players no longer need approval to wear religious head coverings during matches, thanks to a 14-year-old Muslim player who inspired the rule change.

The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), which sets competition rules for most US high school sports, announced on Thursday the new rule and said it could extend to other sports.

Support for the rule change swelled in September after Najah Aqeel, a freshman at Valor Collegiate Prep in Nashville, Tennessee, was disqualified from a volleyball match for wearing a hijab or headscarf.

A referee refused to let her play , citing a casebook rule that required athletes who wear a hijab to be granted authorization from the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA). Najah said she did not have authorization, but that it wasn't an issue for previous matches.

Faced with the choice to remove her hijab or sit out the match, Najah decided not to play. Most Muslim women who wear the hijab only remove it in the presence of other women or immediate family members.

""I'm really humbled and happy that I got to change the rule for volleyball players across the country,"" Najah told CNN. ""I hope this will make sure no one else who wears religious headwear and plays sports will have to go through what I did.""

Changing the rule

At the time of the incident, Najah said she was ""angry and sad"" and felt singled out for her religious beliefs.

NFHS Volleyball Rule 4-1-6 stated: ""Hair devices made of soft material and no more than 3 inches wide may be worn in the hair or on the head. ..."" Because Najah's hijab was much larger than the allowable 3 inches, she needed state association approval to play.

Najah and her family have worked with the TSSAA, NFHS and American Muslim Advisory Council (AMAC) to change the rule.

In October, the NFHS approved a proposal for each sport rules committee to consider that would allow players to wear religious head coverings -- unless deemed a safety risk to the wearer or other participants -- without prior approval from state associations.

Najah Aqeel, center, and her parents.

The volleyball committee was the first to meet in 2021 and promptly approved the proposal.

""For the committee that was pretty much a no-brainer,"" committee chair Jo Auch said in a statement . ""Our goal is always to have our athletes be able to participate as long as there isn't a safety concern involved, so it made perfect sense to relax that rule and remove the requirement for the states to authorize the wearing of religious headwear.""

Other sport rules committees will also consider the proposal. If adopted by all, it would impact most US high school sports.

""Najah and her family have been gracious and patient throughout the significant process; from discovery, to listening to one another, to learning and ultimately to decision-making at the state and national levels,"" NFHS executive director Karissa Niehoff said in a statement

""Najah's perspective, maturity and ability to communicate define her as a model for young people everywhere. We hope that her situation serves as a reminder of the beautiful fabric of diversity that exists in our schools and society overall.""

A win for religious freedom

Sabina Mohyuddin, executive director of the American Muslim Advisory Council, hailed the rule change as a victory for religious freedom.

""The NFHS ruling is a momentous occasion and sends a clear message that Muslim girls who choose to wear the hijab don't need permission to be a Muslim in public spaces,"" Mohyuddin told CNN.

""We will keep chipping away at any policies that discriminate against our community. Najah is truly a trailblazer. I admire her courage and determination to stand up for her equitable access to sports throughout this process.""

The rule change will also impact student athletes of other religions, including Jews who wear kippahs and Sikhs who wear turbans.

Najah hopes her stand inspires student athletes of all faiths and backgrounds to continue advocating for equality in sports.

""If there is any message I could give to everyone out there in the world, don't be afraid to follow your dreams,"" Najah said. ""Never be afraid to stand up for what you believe in."""
Opinion: 'Please help' -- 20 stories of Americans trying to get the Covid-19 vaccine,"That's how one reader described the process of trying to sign her elderly parents up to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.

In the past year, this virus has changed everyone's life. Death, in an instant, became a constant worry for many. Schools closed and parents looked for ways to explain this new normal to their children. Industries shuttered, savings dried up and many families suddenly found themselves having to decide between paying rent or buying food. Quarantining and social distancing made holidays and celebrations look different.

When trials began to show high efficacy and effectiveness for vaccines, it offered a glimmer of hope for millions of people. In the United States, that glimmer turned into a bright promise of returning to some semblance of our full lives after the FDA approved the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. But the rollout has proven to be less than perfect. As Brenda Kotewa of Bellingham, Washington, put it, so many Americans are left ""wondering if we'll get the vaccine or the virus first."" According to Steve from Maryland, he and his wife are in group 1B, but even though the state has moved on to group 1C, when he tries to get an appointment ""there is nothing within a 50-mile radius. Disheartening.""

Kotewa and Steve are two of nearly 1,400 readers who shared stories with us about efforts to get vaccinated, writing candidly about everything from waking up at dawn to try to secure a spot in that day's vaccine allotment to having appointments canceled at the last minute.

JUST WATCHED More Covid-19 vaccination sites opening across the US Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH More Covid-19 vaccination sites opening across the US 02:44

Sprinkled in there were success stories, but most of them were, as many readers put it, because of sheer luck -- getting on the right website, on the right day and pressing ""submit"" or ""enter"" at just the right time. For many, navigating the system to try to get an appointment has proven to be, at best, confusing and -- because of delays -- at worst, deadly.

Children trying to help an elderly parent figure out the scheduling process was a common thread. Denise Thomsen Kates, writing from Lewes, Delaware, described waiting in line in the car with her dad, a widower, getting by on snacks and one bottle of water as ahead of them, other cars would just pull out of the line and drive away, ""no doubt because they needed to use a bathroom or were running out of gas. After four hours we were finally at the vaccine site, only to face more zig-zagging traffic patterns. But at least there were portable toilets at the site. My dad could use the facilities while I continued to move the car. But how did the people who were alone do this? They couldn't leave their car. Yes I'm thankful my dad got his vaccine. Yes I'm thankful for all the volunteers who made it possible. But it was a terrible experience.""

Parents of veterans are having difficulty as well. Joan Gamso, who lives in Naples, Florida, expressed frustration about her dad's local VA facility in Cape Coral, writing: ""I have called numerous times and went there in person. I have been told they just do not have vaccines. It's rather ironic that our local supermarket chain, Publix, has vaccines every week...but the VA does not...?"" Gamso has since been able to get an appointment for her 96-year-old dad.

Joan Gamso's father Stanley

Others were relying on good Samaritans like Anchorage, Alaska, resident Diane Nigg, who works as a travel agent and contact tracer, and wrote: ""As soon as I heard about the vaccine being available for older Alaskans, I contacted my clients to see if they needed help in signing up. Most of them did because they didn't have computers and also weren't aware of locations that they could call to arrange for an appointment.""

Then there were those who would otherwise be considered high-risk not being designated as a priority in the first phases of the rollout. This included people who are pregnant, work in essential jobs that are not in the health industry, have special needs or disabilities or are young with immunocompromising disorders and other illnesses. Heartbreakingly, one reader expressed profound guilt that working with the elderly at a facility put her first in line for a vaccine, ahead of all her own elderly family members -- for whom she's been struggling all along to obtain appointments.

Perhaps the most difficult refrain to read was this: ""Please help."" So many of you wrote some version of that plea in describing your struggle and isolation. May the selection of stories below serve as a reminder that you are not alone.



Some have been lightly edited for clarity and flow.

'I have never felt so worthless'

I am 46 years old and have stage IV lung cancer. I'm missing half of one lung. I am forced to go into hospitals frequently, as I am on active treatment. Multiple studies have determined a lung cancer patient's risk of hospitalization to be 65%, and risk of mortality to be 25-30%. That's approximately double the mortality rate of an 80 year old.

Yet, exactly because I am disabled and under 65, I have been denied the vaccine here in New York. Twice. The first time, I waited in line with my husband, a healthy college professor who IS eligible for the vaccine and secured an appointment. Although there were 60 no shows as of 3:30 PM, I was denied a vaccine per Governor's orders. In other words, it was more important for the vaccine to go UNUSED than it was to give a terminally ill cancer patient a vaccine.

This is cruel. I have invested a lot of energy over the past six years to keep myself alive, despite a dismal prognosis. Yet it isn't cancer, but a policy decision to give the vaccine to people who happen to work in certain professions (many of which aren't actually at higher risk of contracting the disease), in lieu of giving the vaccine to high risk individuals, that may do me in. I have never felt so worthless. (On Friday, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that starting February 15, those with some listed comorbidities and underlying conditions, including cancer, would be eligible for the vaccine.)

What would happen to my grandson?

I am a retired 72-year-old with asthma. I am also raising my eight year old grandson, who recently went back to in person school. After almost a year of staying home and isolated, my state decided that it was time for those over 65 and those in multigenerational households to be vaccinated. I spent two weeks on the computer and phone trying to find a vaccine appointment.

I am fairly computer literate because I am raising a child who has been learning virtually. I was checking every pharmacy chain, medical group and a mass vaccination site multiple times a day. I finally managed to secure an appointment for my first dose. If something happens to me, I don't know who would take my grandson. I can't imagine being unable to navigate the sign up pages like some of my friends. Once I am vaccinated, I am going to try to help my friends and neighbors who are struggling to get appointments.

My father died from a disease he should have been able to get a vaccine for

My father was in a retirement home that was trying to get the vaccine. Unfortunately he fell and had to have hip replacement surgery. Despite my requests, he did not get the vaccine in the hospital. He then went to a rehab facility that had delays on the vaccine. He was scheduled to get the first shot but tested positive for Covid the day before that would happen due to an outbreak at the facility. He died five days later of a disease that he should have been able to get a vaccine for when he was at the hospital.

He was at incredibly high risk at age 82 with a history of pneumonia, heart issues, and being in a shared living situation. The day he died, I was told (by his doctor) that it didn't matter if they treated him for Covid because he was going to die anyway.

Pregnant, canceled and rescheduled

As a pregnant teacher, I have been trying to get vaccinated ever since my state started phrase 1B. I signed up for a vaccine everywhere I was able. A few days later, I received an appointment only to have the site call and cancel. I rescheduled. I received another call from the site saying that the link was down and I should have never received the appointment to begin with. The appointment was canceled for a second time. I have made an appointment at another location later this week. I am hopeful I will be able to receive my vaccine.

The staff at my parents' doctor's office laughed at me

My 94-year-old parents, who still live alone in the Paramus, NJ home in which I grew up are confused and frustrated as they have followed the steps which they were directed to do.

Weeks ago when the websites first went up, they had registered with every NJ vaccination site. They expected, as the websites stated, to be contacted to schedule an appointment, but they have not received any contact whatsoever. Seventy year old friends of mine who live near them contacted a site and were able to get appointments and have now been vaccinated. I then started helping my parents to no avail. I log into the sites multiple times a day hoping for an opening anywhere in NJ. I will hire a limo to get them where the vaccination is as I live in Lititz, PA. I even contacted my parents' general practitioner only to have the office staff laugh as I inquired and asked for their assistance.

My issue is this: why haven't 90+ year olds, who registered, been contacted and scheduled before healthy 70 year olds? Why aren't doctors' offices coordinating with the state to make sure this part of the population is taken care of? There are many people like my parents who are fortunate to not need a nursing home or assisted living but need assistance with this pandemic. How many are waiting for that e-mail or call? How many do not even know what to do? My parents are starting to feel that this is a ""triage"" and that their age is seen as not worth saving.

Two states, two very different stories

My story is awesome. I live in Louisville, Kentucky and our governor and his cracker-jack team have this vaccination gig working well. I am a teacher and when it was our school's turn to sign up for a vaccine, I went directly to LouVax.Com, put in my info and got an appointment the next day to receive my first vaccine. Our fairgrounds hosted a drive-thru vaccination site and I was through the line, vaccinated, waited for 15 minutes next to ambulances ready to rush anyone with anaphylactic shock to a hospital and was on my way home within 25 minutes. It honestly couldn't have been easier.

Unfortunately, this has not been the case for my 80 and 81 year old parents in Florida. Their local health department has partnered with an events/concert site and I have been trying to help them get appointments. The site is extremely frustrating to use. It opens at exactly 9:00 am and one is immediately told that they are in line and to wait. Once the individual's turn arrives the site says to hurry and select a time. I scrolled through every single time slot and was told that all spots were filled. Then the site just shuts down.

I had three browsers open and went online exactly at 9:00 am and received no appointments. My parents have been going through this week after week with the same outcome. Whoever is handling Florida's vaccination registration needs to contact Kentucky's governor for some tips because what they're doing isn't working. I'm honestly surprised that we don't have a FedVax system that assigns appointments to individuals instead of making registration such a challenge for these seniors. Especially in places like Florida, where a large portion of the population is over 65, I think we are asking a great deal from a group of individuals who are definitely immigrants to the usage of a home computer. I fear we will never get to herd immunity if the registration system doesn't get tweaked quickly.

Living in a state where there isn't a mask mandate

I'm almost 75, a little overweight and have medically controlled high blood pressure. I live in a rural area between Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Our almost useless appointment registration system is a very not funny joke. All I get day after day is a list of ""no appointments available"" locations. I can only hope that President Joe Biden's plan to give states information about how many vaccines they will receive three weeks in advance will help.

By the way, Gov. Kevin Stitt still won't issue a mask mandate. Therefore stores and shops can't enforce mask wearing. It frightens me to the core to have to shop for groceries. More than half of the other shoppers are maskless. No vaccine and no protection is a potentially deadly threat to me.

Two computers, one iPhone, one iPad -- and no appointments

This morning was the third time we woke at 5:30 am after a restless night to set up our two computers, one iPhone and one iPad to the Publix website hoping to set one of the 3000 reservations in Volusia County, Florida. We never moved beyond the 'refresh every 60 seconds' page and by 7:10, we were told the site was completely booked. We will try again in a few days. Very frustrating, especially as we hear of those who were successful.

'We were told we would need to start the process again'

I am 73; my wife is 67. Even though we are in a group that is eligible for the vaccine, we have not been able to find any in the area. Virginia has health districts which administer the vaccine distribution; our health district has no good information on their website. We have twice had specific appointments for inoculations and both were canceled by the providers.

This last time Kroger called an hour and a half before the appointment to say it was canceled because the store had run out of vaccine. When we inquired about whether we would be contacted and rescheduled when they received additional doses, we were told that we would need to start the process again but that their appointments were filled until the end of March.

The luck of a well-timed phone call

I live in rural west Tennessee and am 73. I put myself on the state waiting list a few weeks ago through their website. From a social media group in my neighborhood, I found out yesterday that they had opened up vaccines to those 70 and over. I had not heard from the state about where I was on the waitlist and could get no specifics from the call center.

So I decided to call the county health department and they told me I could come in at 1 pm for a drive through vaccine. I only had to wait about 10 minutes and it was quite efficient. But if I hadn't called the health department that day, I never would have known about it and would still be waiting for a notice that might never have come.

Fear blocks the light at the end of the tunnel

I was designated an essential worker by the Governor last March. My wife was let go from her job but then found a job with Costco. I have believed from day one that critical care health workers, teachers and essential workers should be able to get a vaccine.

Well, I am registered on three health department websites, have gotten a text to make an appointment, then there are none available. Walgreens, Jewel, private doctor, NOPE, nothing. I worked overnight this weekend and tried to time it at exactly midnight to see if ANY entity maybe added more capacity. Get inside the portal, all is going GREAT, then nothing. Circle of death, Bad Gateway, or simply frozen phone, tablet or desktop computer.

Local officials are over promising and under delivering. A friend who works from home several days a week for the Illinois State Police got vaccinated. She said was incredibly well run, in and out after driving to Chicago's McCormick Place. Why can't that implementation be scaled? How do we reward success with more opportunities?

I fear for my wife, my family. I'm not special but both me and my wife have been keeping the commerce running for nearly a year now. I'm afraid our luck will run out just as the light at the end of the tunnel slowly comes into focus.

-- Frank Wiltse, Plainfield, Illinois

What about high-risk people who are bedbound?

I work full time from home, which is fortunate as I am the guardian and caretaker for my 100-year-old mother. I have pre-registered her on our county's vaccination site. I reached out to the Maryland Department of Health on what to do as she is bedbound. Clearly she cannot ""go"" to a vaccination site. It was not easy to find a place on the site to ask a question, but after quite a bit of searching I found a place.

I received a reply that didn't answer my question at all but gave me information on how to find a clinic nearby. And if I had additional questions, it said that I should call my local health department. I tried that, but after an hour on hold I gave up. It seems that this gap of making the vaccine accessible to vulnerable, elderly home-bound people is not being addressed.

-- Sharon, Maryland

'I'm so thankful that we were able to get this good medicine'

Our local tribe has a drive-thru vaccination clinic. First our Elders and the healthcare workers were vaccinated. A few days later, I received a robo-call from the clinic telling me that I'm eligible. I got my first jab with no problem. Shortly after, the clinic began offering vaccines to non-tribal spouses, which my husband was happy to get!

My mother lives with us, and she is Finnish-American. She's got good health insurance (retired Army nurse), and she was only recently (2 days ago) able to schedule an appointment that isn't for a few more weeks. She's got a pacemaker and other factors that have her high risk, along with being nearly 73 years young.

It is frustrating, and I couldn't help but feel bad that my husband and I could get our jabs, but here, my mother, a veteran, couldn't yet. Oh, and she was dependent on me for the help to get this sorted -- she doesn't navigate the internet very well.

I'm so thankful that we were able to get this good medicine. I get my second Moderna dose on Monday! It is a good day to be Indigenous. Can't help but to feel bad that so many are suffering and wanting this vaccine, but I'm doing my part in our home being a covid-free home for our family, and ultimately, our community. And I'm especially proud that our tribes have access to this amazing medicine!

The most frustrating lottery in the world

In California, it took four of us to try to get appointments online for my elderly in-laws. Appointments opened up at noon on a Saturday. We had my two teens each on their own laptop, my husband on his phone and my sister in law on her device trying to secure appointments. After 30 minutes, some 10,000 appointments were booked. We were lucky enough to get one of them an appointment.

It's like a lottery, so frustrating. There just aren't enough vaccines to keep up with demand. We have to wait for the next round of appointments to become available to try to get my mother-in-law an appointment. Meanwhile, my sisters and I are trying to book appointments for my elderly parents in another county. Both my parents and my in-laws don't speak English fluently and are depending on us to help them. What about those folks who have no one to advocate for them? This is just sad.

'It's been a long lonely journey'

I'm so excited for the vaccine, but so far I don't even know when my time will come. Living with a disability, I have been alone at home working remotely from the first news report of a man diagnosed, just two counties away -- about an hour away. It's been a long lonely journey. I've been angry at people feeling oppressed by mere weeks of shelter in place orders, and being more and more reckless and defiant in their behavior, while I and many others with disabilities continued to tighten our circles. On the other hand, as a counselor, I understand what isolation does to people, and I'm compassionate about their need for a little normalcy. I want my children to be able to return to school.

I am starting to see friends and family getting the vaccine, and while I am excited for them, there's very little consistency on who is getting it first. I'm sure it is hard to determine the best approach because everyone needs the vaccine, but as the clock is ticking, a huge group of people with disabilities who are able to live independently with some assistance -- sometimes forgoing the assistance to keep ourselves safe -- are left wondering if we'll get the vaccine or the virus first.

A nursing mom's experience

I am a school-based Speech Language Pathologist, so in Illinois, I am considered in group 1a. I am also a mom of a newborn so it was important for me to be vaccinated as soon as possible to help protect my family who either can't receive the vaccine or won't be able to receive it for months due to being in a lower priority group. My school district has been in person since August and has not had an outbreak, but has had numerous student and staff cases.

Due to my job as a SLP, I am within 6 ft of students for more than 15 minutes throughout the school day. Finding a place to receive the vaccine was extremely frustrating with only hospitals and one doctors group in the county having access to the vaccine. I called multiple pharmacies and was either told they didn't know anything or to suggest that I try other pharmacies in a neighboring county. When I contacted them I was told I needed to live or work within that county to be eligible even though they had appointments available.

I was finally able to contact the doctors group who I do not use and was able to begin the process of signing up for their appointment contact group when my school district was able to secure vaccine spots for employees. I was able to receive the first shot of the Moderna vaccine just over a week ago.

'Like going to Wal-Mart on Black Friday'

I am a nurse and work from home doing case management for a Medicaid HMO. By day I am saddened by the stories I review of people hospitalized with Covid-19. By night I am angered by the stories I hear from friends and their families about traveling, visiting and for the most part ignoring this pandemic. In the between times I have been attempting fruitlessly to secure an appointment for the vaccine.

At first it was just a word of mouth rumble...vaccines available here, a mysterious phone number to call, a waiting list to get on in a far flung county. I dutifully followed every lead like a private eye without any success. Occasionally a friend or coworker would call with the great news. ""I got one!"" But it seemed a very mysterious process and never worked out for me. I contacted the local health dept. and was finally directed to sign up via an online portal which I did immediately and joyfully spread the news to all friends who were vaccine seekers. Now I get a voicemail when vaccines will be available and a time to log on to the portal.

Sounds great right?! Well, NOT. It is like going to Wal-Mart on Black Friday. Everyone rushing at once and of course the website crashes requiring re booting and that eternal circle of dots going round and round and round. When I am finally able to get to the treasured date/time choices I am required to pick date/time for both the first and second doses then am directed to another screen that tells me if those choices are available. If not it is back to start over...and over...and over.

I am left with sadness...and anger...and fear. I do not want to become one of those Covid cases that a nurse case manager is reading about on her work computer. Pray for me!

'I see it like oxygen masks on a plane'

I live in Mississippi. I am fortunate to be retired (I'm 75) because landing a Covid vaccination appointment is a full time job. I have a good network of friends and I keep up to date with the news. Therefore, I knew when appointments opened up and how to sign up. So much early info was word of mouth. My 90 year old stepmom and I drove 90 miles south to get our first shots. I managed to get us appointments for the second one on February 16th. So many people (especially in a poor, rural state) don't have computers and smartphones or even email addresses (required).

I have helped some people. I see it like oxygen masks on a plane. I'll put one on my face and then I will help others. I see the Oxford MS police department is helping people sign up. Why aren't more community agencies or churches helping? We need more vaccine taken directly into the community instead of waiting for the community to come to the vaccine.

If we had a national policy, this wouldn't be happening

I am a 75 year old retired teacher from Los Alamos, New Mexico. I have asthma and use an oxygen concentrator all night and most days. My husband is 78 and has a heart condition. We are both in the high risk category for Covid-19. We are currently living in the Birmingham, Alabama area in order to assist my son and daughter-in-law with the virtual schooling of 2 of their young sons, ages 6 and 8. They also have two toddlers, ages 2 and 4. All of the children are high energy boys.

We came to help relieve the pressure on the family since both parents' jobs require them to be at work in person. We pray that their efforts to use Covid safe practices at work will continue to be effective. In Jefferson County, Alabama, a call-in system is set up to register for the vaccine. We have now called in to register as well as registered in-line. They do have our names, ages, and health problems listed. We have not been called back to make appointments. We keep talking to people who say we will be called or emailed to schedule an appointment.

To be fair, they don't ask if we are permanent residents of the state. This has been going on for the last two months since the system has been in place. We still have no appointments. Meanwhile, we heard that a neighboring county has been allowing drive-up vaccination first-come, first served. We are considering vaccine tourism in Mississippi or Other nearby states. But travel puts people at risk as well— especially considering the new Covid variants contagion rates. If we were in New Mexico we would have received our shots already because our Governor, Michelle Luhan Grisham, is really on top of her game. If we had a national policy, these discrepancies would not be occurring, would they? Thanks Trump. (On Friday, Cathy said she received an email from a local hospital with a date, time and location for an upcoming appointment.)

'We work, we wait and we try to be as safe as we can'

When the world shut down, many ""essential"" industries remained open. The industries that employ myself and my husband (construction and manufacturing respectively) continued to work. Now, Ohio has decided that we need to get in line later rather than earlier. We both have conditions that could result in a more severe covid infection, but these conditions are not being addressed (autoimmune and a genetic blood clotting issue for me, diabetes for my husband).

It is extremely frustrating that we can't even sign up and get a place in line for when our time comes up. If only this state was following the CDC guidelines, it's likely that at least my husband would be fighting for his spot in line now. Instead, we work, we wait, and we try to be as safe as we can, all the while living in "" red"" Ohio, where masks are worn according to political affiliation.

Harris and Yellen work with Black business leaders on recovery plan,"New York (CNN) Vice President Kamala Harris called on America's Black business leaders to help spread the word that it is critical for Black Americans to take the Covid-19 vaccine to begin repairing the economic damage caused by the pandemic.

""If we're going to build back up our economy, we've gotta get control of this,"" Harris said of the virus Friday afternoon. ""People have within their power the ability to save their lives, the lives of their family members, their community -- but they've gotta get vaccinated.""

Harris's remarks came during a virtual roundtable with Black business leaders across the country. She was joined by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as they discussed how the Biden administration's American Rescue Plan could help Black small business owners recover from the financial devastation they've endured since the pandemic began in March.

About 41% of the nation's Black-owned businesses permanently closed between February and April of 2020, according to multiple studies. An estimated 17% of White-owned businesses shut down over the same period, according to a University of California, Santa Cruz study released in June.

The Great Recession of 2008 had already widened inequality between Black and White America, and the current pandemic-fueled recession has made the gap even larger. ""This pandemic has exacerbated all the problems that existed before,"" Yellen said.

More than 100 students and staff quarantined in San Diego County 2 days after resuming in-person learning,"(CNN) Two days after officials welcomed back students to on-campus instruction, about 100 students and staff across a San Diego County school district were ordered to quarantine due to Covid-19 infections reported across various K-8th grade campuses -- raising questions about whether schools in the region are ready to reopen their doors.

""While the quarantines so early in the reopening are frustrating and concerning, positive Covid cases and quarantines were not unexpected,"" Escondido Union School District Superintendent Dr. Luis Rankins-Ibarra said in a statement to CNN.

The challenging environment created by Covid-19 has impacted schools nationwide as teachers and students grapple with the new reality of distance-learning models, wearing masks, and social distancing, following the recommendations of local and state health officials.

After months spent learning online, many officials are eager to reopen classrooms, which has sparked debate over whether it is safe to return to in-person learning.

In Escondido, 8,700 students across 23 campuses were enrolled in their hybrid model learning program that began Tuesday, with students divided into cohorts and attending school in-person at different portions of the day.

"Jim Weatherly, 'Midnight Train to Georgia' songwriter, dies at 77","(CNN) Jim Weatherly first gained notice as a University of Mississippi football player, and then as a hit songwriter.

And his love for the game led to his greatest success in music, involving first a young Farrah Fawcett and ultimately a legendary recording of his tune ""Midnight Train to Georgia"" by Gladys Knight and the Pips.

Weatherly, who also wrote songs for Ray Price, Glen Campbell, Kenny Rogers and others, died Wednesday at his home in Brentwood, Tennessee, near Nashville, family friend Charlie Monk told the Tennessean newspaper.

He was 77, and his family told Monk that Weatherly died of natural causes.

Born in Mississippi, Weatherly played on the University of Mississippi football team in an undefeated 1962 season, an SEC championship and a national championship. The next year, he was the starting quarterback when the Rebels repeated as SEC champs.

Black people in history: Little-known figures to know,"Elegant, swinging, exuberant – it’s hard to find one word to describe the lush music of Gerald Wilson, one of the most important bandleaders in the history of jazz. Wilson never got the attention of big band arrangers like Duke Ellington, but he was also a major innovator in jazz music.

A slim, enthusiastic man known for his personal kindness, Wilson practically danced when he directed his orchestra. A lover of many musical styles, he incorporated everything from blues, Basie and Bartok in his arrangements.

While many big-band recordings sound dated today, Wilson’s music still sounds cutting-edge. One critic noted that Wilson’s influence was so wide that “even if you had never heard of him, you were often hearing him.”

Born in Shelby, Mississippi, Wilson learned piano from his mother. He started as a trumpet player, moved to Los Angeles and eventually became a composer-arranger, working with everyone from Ellington and Count Basie to Ray Charles and Ella Fitzgerald.

At one point, when his career was thriving, Wilson stepped away from commercial success to study classical masters such as Stravinsky and Bartok.

Wilson is best known for his recordings on the Pacific Jazz label, which redefined big band music. One critic said Wilson’s Pacific Jazz music was full of “gorgeous nuances, and an elegance that hasn’t been equaled since that time.”

His arrangements were archived by the Library of Congress and in 1990, the National Endowment for the Arts honored him with a Jazz Masters Award. When he died at 96, one musician said Wilson’s energy always made him seem like he was the youngest person in the room."

Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the incoming chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he wants to hold confirmation hearing for Attorney General nominee Merrick Garland on Feb. 8, a day before the impeachment trial of former President Trump begins in the Senate.

But he said he doesn’t know if Republicans on the committee would consent to allow it to happen without a one-week formal notification of the hearing, as committee rules require.

Durbin said he planned to talk Wednesday to Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who will be the top Republican on the committee, to see if they can reach an agreement to do it then.

The discussions come after an agreement was reached on an organizing resolution for the Senate, which should be officially adopted by the full Senate at some point Wednesday, that allows Democrats to finally take control of the committees even though they moved into majority control of the Senate back on Jan. 20.

Durbin, who is also the second-ranking member of the Democratic leadership, said he didn’t know if Republicans would agree to a one-day hearing for Garland instead of the customary two-day hearings for attorney general nominees. The outgoing chairman of the committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, has been adamant this week that he wanted two-days of hearings, something that would not be possible with the impeachment trial starting Tuesday.

Asked about Graham’s concerns, Durbin said, “I had a conversation with him (Graham) that left that uncertain so I want to speak to Sen. Grassley directly.”

Durbin also rebutted criticism from Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, who said Democrats were to blame for not filling out Biden’s Cabinet quickly because they were putting Covid relief and the impeachment trial first.

“Of course we want the Cabinet in place,” Durbin told CNN as he left a memorial service of US Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was killed during the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol that is the reason an impeachment trial is happening. “We cannot ignore what happened Jan. 6. This day more than others should be a reminder for every member of the Senate and House about what we lost that day and we just can’t ignore that reality and the impeachment that’s looming in the United States Senate.”

He also said it was critical to get Garland confirmed calling him, “The last major element of our national security team. It should be a high priority.”"
States are looking to help their vulnerable communities as vaccine distribution ramps up,"(CNN) As officials make strides to improve accessibility to Covid-19 vaccines in the United States, some states are turning their focus to the underserved and vulnerable communities that have not yet been eligible for protection.

Though the country's vaccination rate is not at President Joe Biden's hoped-for level of 1.5 million shots per day, the US has recently gotten closer, having averaged 1.3 million new shots a day over the last week, according to federal data.

States initially raced to vaccinate their priority populations, often health care workers and people in long-term care facilities, followed by seniors and/or essential workers , with many states saying demand for vaccines was exceeding supply.

Now New York, with about 75% of hospital workers inoculated, may become the first state to offer vaccine access to people with the simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions, no matter their age. The governor's office listed cancer, chronic kidney disease, pulmonary disease and heart conditions as some of the comorbidities and underlying conditions that the state will use to determine eligibility for the Covid-19 vaccine.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo also said Friday that the state is now vaccinating those in the prison system along the same guidelines as the general public.

And in Texas, the Houston Health Department said Friday that it will prioritize ""vulnerable populations"" and ""underserved communities"" as it receives additional vaccine allotments.

Houston leaders said Saturday that publicly run hospitals serving the uninsured were getting a smaller percentage of vaccine doses than private hospitals.

""If you want to address the disparity, you've got to send the doses to the venues that are reaching those regions,"" Mayor Sylvester Turner said at a news conference.

US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said the disparity is making it more difficult to wipe out the virus Texas.

""The state is majority Hispanic, but the largest number of people who've gotten vaccinated are Anglos,"" Jackson Lee said.

When it comes to reaching the underserved, such as people who are homeless, those without insurance and migrant workers, local pharmacies and health centers are a better option than trying to ""reinvent the wheel"" with mass vaccination sites, Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir said in a radio interview aired Friday.

""I think trying to set up a big federal site in the middle of Dallas that will immunize 10,000 a day, that's much less amenable,"" the former Health and Human Services assistant secretary said on SiriusXM's ""Doctor Radio Reports."" ""It's not meeting people where they are, and it's much less efficient than having the distributed network that we've already established and have been using for decades.""

As of Saturday, more than 39 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's more than 2 million more than reported Friday. More than 30.2 million people have received at least one dose, according to CDC data.

Variant surges are possible but not inevitable

Health experts have warned that the spread of new coronavirus variants , some of which appear to be more transmissible, could lead to them becoming predominant and spur more case surges.

But that is ""not necessarily an inevitability,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci told MSNBC's ""The Beat"" on Friday.

One of the best ways to keep variants from spreading and to prevent more mutations, he said, was ""to double down on public health measures to prevent the virus from going from one person to another: the masking, the distancing, the avoiding congregate settings.""

Another is for the public to get vaccinated as soon as possible, said Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

""As soon as the vaccine becomes available, please go out and get vaccinated, because the combination of vaccination and public health measures will bring the level of virus down so low you won't give it a chance to mutate,"" Fauci said.

AstraZeneca study on variant first identified in South Africa

AstraZeneca, whose vaccine has been approved in other countries but not in the US, said Saturday that a study in a small Phase I/II trial suggests the vaccine isn't effective at protecting again mild and moderate Covid-19 caused by the variant first identified in South Africa , one of the most concerning variants identified so far.

The trial subjects were ""predominantly young healthy adults,"" an AstraZeneca spokesperson said in a statement, so the company hasn't been able to ""properly ascertain"" the vaccine's protection against mild and moderate disease.

The company said the vaccine could protect against severe disease, and it's working to modify the vaccine.

""Oxford University and AstraZeneca have started adapting the vaccine against this variant and will advance rapidly through clinical development so that it is ready for Autumn delivery should it be needed,"" the spokesperson said.

The study will be released Monday.

Schools navigate returning to campus

Teachers and school staff have also been prioritized for vaccination as many states look to resume in-person instruction for the first time in nearly a year.

As of Friday, 24 states and Washington, DC , are allowing some or all of their teachers and school staff to receive coronavirus vaccines.

Vermont has begun to even allow sports competition to resume February 12, so long as teams have no more than two games in a seven-day period, keep a minimum of three days between competitions and bar spectators.

However, following months of remote learning, officials at the Escondido Union School District in San Diego County brought students back on campus Tuesday.

But two days later, more than 100 students and staff were ordered to quarantine due to Covid-19 infections reported across their various K - 8th grade campuses.

The fear of such transmission between students and staff has snarled negotiations in the Chicago public school system, the third largest in the country.

Now a showdown is looming between the Chicago Teachers Union and the Chicago Public Schools, after weeks of negotiations over the resumption of in-person classes.

Late Friday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and CPS Chief Executive Officer Janice Jackson said in a letter sent to teachers that pre-K and cluster program teachers and staff without accommodation who fail to report to work Monday will be locked out of the school's online systems.

The union, for its part, said that city leaders had ""walked away from the bargain table again.""

Officials plead against Super Bowl parties

Officials and public health experts are pleading with people to avoid Super Bowl parties on Sunday, to cut down on chances for the virus to spread.

""Now is not the time for a Super Bowl party,"" Alabama State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said Friday. ""Now is not the time to fumble the ball, because you got careless by spending time with a bunch of people that are not in your household.""

Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine at Grady Health System, said he worries these parties could send cases surging again.

""If there's a lot of Super Bowl parties and a lot of superspreader events, we will start (to see) cases start to come up again,"" del Rio said Saturday. ""I sure hope that doesn't happen because we really need cases to come down ... so eventually mortality will also come down.

""I want to back down to less than 1,000 deaths per day.""

The US has not averaged fewer than 1,000 Covid-19 deaths a day across a week since early November, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The country's current average across a week is 3,250 deaths a day -- not far from the peak average of 3,357 reached January 13, according to Johns Hopkins data.

Case and hospitalization levels, however, have been dropping recently after holiday surges.

The country has averaged more than 125,800 new Covid-19 cases a day over the last week -- down 49.6% since a pandemic-peak average of 249,836 on January 8, Johns Hopkins data shows."
Protests break out in Myanmar in defiance of military coup,"(CNN) An Australian adviser to Myanmar's recently deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi was detained on Saturday as pro-democracy protests broke out in the country's largest city on Saturday.

Thousands of people took to the streets of Yangon in the first major organized demonstration since the military seized power in a coup earlier this week.

The crowd, many of whom could be seen waiving flags and holding banners, called for the military to release Suu Kyi, and other democratically-elected lawmakers, who were detained in pre-dawn raids Monday.

Chants of ""We demand democracy"" could be heard coming from the crowd as they marched close to downtown Yangon, prompting the government to impose an internet blackout.

Dozens of police, some in riot gear, had initially attempted to block the protest route, forcing the crowd to change direction.

During the earlier large-scale march, passers-by could be seen giving the three-finger salute of opposition to army rule, in apparent solidarity with those demonstrating. Others were seen applauding and handing out water to both protesters and police in what one witness described as a way of defusing tension.

Witnesses described the crowd as expanding in size, before appearing to disperse after several hours. But a number of smaller, scattered protests remained ongoing including one at Yangon University, where several hundred mostly young people gathered and continued to chant.

Resistance to the coup had initially proved limited, due in part to widespread communications difficulties , as well as fears of a further crackdown.

Internet monitoring service NetBlocks said Saturday that the country was in the midst of a second ""national-scale"" internet blackout as the military attempted to secure its grip on power.

According to NetBlocks, real-time network data showed connectivity had fallen to 16% of ordinary levels and users had reported difficultly getting online.

The Myanmar Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC) ordered the nationwide shutdown of the data network on Saturday, according to Norwegian telecommunications company Telenor Group, which runs Telenor Myanmar.

The group, writing on Twitter, said the ministry cited ""Myanmar's Telecommunication Law, and references circulation of fake news, stability of the nation and interest of the public as basis for the order.""

Protesters hold up the three finger salute during a demonstration in Yangon on February 6.

While voice calls and SMS remain operational, Telenor Group said it was deeply concerned by the internet shutdown, but said Telenor Myanmar is a local company and is therefore ""bound by local law and needs to handle this irregular and difficult situation.""

""We deeply regret the impact the shutdown has on the people in Myanmar,"" Telenor said.

Witnesses told CNN that internet connection has been intermittent on Saturday, though some people were still able to stream video from the march in Yangon on social media platforms.

The fall in connectivity follows moves to block access to social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as a number of prominent local news outlets.

Australian citizen detained

The Australian adviser to Suu Kyi, Sean Turnell, told Reuters that he had been detained on Saturday. ""I guess you will soon hear of it, but I am being detained,"" he told Reuters reporters in a message.

""Being charged with something, but not sure what. I am fine and strong, and not guilty of anything,"" he said, with a smile emoji.

Turnell is a professor of economics at Macquarie University, but according to his page on the university's website, he is currently on leave while working as a senior economic adviser to the government of Myanmar.

In a statement released on Saturday, Australia's Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade [DFAT] raised concerns about the detention of an Australian citizen.

""The Australian Government is deeply concerned about reports of Australian and other foreign nationals being detained arbitrarily in Myanmar,"" it wrote.

""In particular, we have serious concerns about an Australian who has been detained at a police station"" it added.

The DFAT said they have ""called in the Myanmar Ambassador and registered the Australian Government's deep concern about these events.""

Sudden seizure of power

For more than 50 years, Myanmar -- also known as Burma -- was run by successive isolationist military regimes that plunged the country into poverty and brutally stifled any dissent. Thousands of critics, activists, journalists, academics and artists were routinely jailed and tortured during that time.

Recently deposed civilian leader Suu Kyi shot to international prominence during her decades-long struggle against military rule. When her party, the NLD, won a landslide in elections in 2015 and formed the first civilian government, many pro-democracy supporters hoped it would mark a break from the military rule of the past and offer hope that Myanmar would continue to reform.

Protesters flash the three-finger salute during a demonstration against the military coup in Yangon, Myanmar, February 6.

The NLD was widely reported to have won another decisive victory in a November 2020 general election, giving it another five years in power and dashing hopes for some military figures that an opposition party they had backed might take power democratically.

The sudden seizure of power came as the new parliament was due to open and after months of increasing friction between the civilian government and the powerful military, known as the Tatmadaw, over alleged election irregularities. The country's election commission has repeatedly denied mass voter fraud took place.

Hundreds of NLD lawmakers were detained in the capital Naypyitaw Monday, where they had traveled to take up their seats. The junta has since removed 24 ministers and deputies from government and named 11 of its own allies as replacements who will assume their roles in a new administration.

Analysts have suggested the coup was more likely to do with the military attempting to reassert its power and the personal ambition of army chief Min Aung Hlaing, who was set to step down this year, rather than serious claims of voter fraud.

""Facing mandatory retirement in a few months, with no route to a civilian leadership role, and amid global calls for him to face criminal charges in The Hague, he was cornered,"" Jared Genser, an international human rights lawyer who previously served as pro bono counsel to Suu Kyi, wrote for CNN this week.

Monday's coup has been widely condemned internationally, with the United States calling on Myanmar's military leaders to ""immediately relinquish the power they have seized, release the activists and officials they have detained, lift all telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence against civilians."""
Biden administration to propose significant increase in refugees admitted to US,"(CNN) The Biden administration is proposing to revise the number of refugees that can be admitted to the United States in fiscal year 2021 to 62,500, a significant increase from the 15,000 cap put in place under former President Donald Trump, according to a report obtained by CNN.

The proposal comes after President Joe Biden underscored the importance of reclaiming the US posture in the world this week, which includes allowing more refugees to come to the country as was done under previous administrations.

""Today I'm approving an executive order to begin the hard work of restoring our refugee admissions program to help meet the unprecedented global need. It's going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged. But that's precisely what we're going to do,"" Biden said Thursday in his first foreign policy speech as President

CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.

The refugee cap, which dictates how many refugees may be admitted to the US annually, must be approved by the president after consultation with Congress. But where the cap has often been viewed as a goal to be reached, the number of refugees admitted fell short under the Trump administration.

Washing machines and libraries: What life is like in Indian farmers' protest camps,"New Delhi, India (CNN) On a key highway into India's capital, men are doing their laundry in washing machines set up under a makeshift tent.

Just three months ago, this six-lane expressway was a busy thoroughfare for commuters and large trucks bringing supplies into New Delhi. Now, the traffic has been replaced by an almost 2-kilometer (1.2-mile) stretch of supply stores, a medical department and a library -- all part of a colorful, bustling hamlet of tents that's been home to thousands of farmers for months

In November, farmers infuriated by new agricultural reforms drove in tractor conveys from around India to set up multiple blockades at the city's borders.

This camp at Ghazipur on the border between Delhi and the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh is one of three major temporary settlements on the outskirts of the capital. Almost everyone here is from neighboring Uttar Pradesh, but farmers at other camps have come from states including Haryana and Punjab -- the latter is known as the ""bread basket of India"" due to its large food production industry.

Wherever they are from, all have just one aim: to get the three new farming laws passed in September last year repealed. Farmers say the laws will hurt their income and devastate their livelihoods, but the government says they are needed to modernize the country's agricultural industry. That dispute has galvanized some of the biggest protests seen since Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014.

Around 10,000 people -- mainly men, both young and old -- are stationed at Ghazipur alone, according to camp leaders, although the number fluctuates from day-to-day as farmers split their time between their homes and the camp. Many have family members minding their farms, allowing them to stay in the capital for long stretches.

The farmers face challenges -- the cold winter temperatures, clashes with police and security forces, and restrictions on their internet access, among others. Despite that, farmers say they have no plans to leave until the government overturns the laws.

A makeshift town

Here at Ghazipur, the camp hums along like a well-oiled machine.

By night, the farmers who choose to stay asleep in brightly colored tents pitched on the road, or on mattresses underneath their tractors (and in hundreds of vans and trucks). By day, many help run the camp.

All their basic needs are catered for. There are portable toilets -- although the stench makes it unpleasant to get too close. There's also a supply store which has plastic crates of shampoo sachets and tissues -- these supplies, like all those in the camp, were donated either by farmers or supporters of the farmers' cause.

Water is brought in from nearby civic stations. Jagjeet Singh, a 26-year-old from Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, uses his tractor to bring back 4,000 liter (1,057 gallon) tanks of water each day (he brings in about 10 to 12 such tanks a day) that can be used for drinking, bathing, and cleaning. Some men stand by the tank washing the grimy black mud from the wet road off their shoes and legs.

Meals are cooked over a small gas fire in a cast iron pan held up by fire-blackened bricks, and provided for free from inside of a tent that's been constructed from bamboo poles and plastic. A farmer wearing blue medical gloves scoops pakora -- a kind of spiced fritter -- into bowls for farmers who are wrapped in scarves, jackets and hats to brave against Delhi's winter chill. Nearby, cauliflower and potatoes burst out of burlap sacks.

Kuldeep Singh, a 36-year-old farmer, helps to prepare the meals. He came here over 60 days ago. Like many others, his family are helping cover his work back home, although he goes back and forth between the camp and his farm.

""Be it the work back home or the camp, both are equally important,"" he said.

Himanshi Rana, a 20-year-old volunteer operating the camp's makeshift medical center, has also been here for more than two months. She helps treat people's diseases, and tended to farmers who were hit by tear gas during violent demonstrations on January 26 -- India's Republic Day. On that day, thousands of protesters stormed New Delhi's historic Red Fort as police used tear gas and batons against the demonstrators. One protester died, although protesters and police disagree over the cause of death.

""My father is a farmer, I am a farmer's daughter. Me being here is inevitable,"" she said. ""We are here to serve the people ... we will stay put until the government agrees to the demands.""

One thing the protesters are not asking for are face masks. Despite India reporting the most coronavirus cases of any country in the world bar the United States, no farmers at Ghazipur are wearing face coverings.

Farmers at Ghazipur say they're not worried about coronavirus -- according to Rana, they believe that they have strong immunity from their physical labor, meaning they're not scared of catching it.

What life is like in the camps

The mood of the camp is joyful, more like a festival than a demonstration.

The camp itself is a kind of protest -- the farmers are blocking the road to help bring awareness to their cause. It's also the base for demonstrations, including the rally that turned violent on Republic Day

For many, there are hours of downtime when they're not helping run the camp or holding demonstrations. A group of men sit in a circle smoking hookah pipes, while others play cards on a blanket. More than a dozen men sit or stand on a red tractor, playing a pro-farmer song from the speakers as they ride through the camp. There's a library for the youngsters that includes books on revolutions in multiple languages.

Every now and again, a group breaks into a chant. ""We'll be here until the government gives in!""

As the water collector Jagjeet Singh puts it: ""I don't feel like I am away from home.""

Farmers in Ghazipur gather fresh fruit from the back of a supply truck, on February 4, 2021.

And there are people besides the protesters, too. Young children dash through the camp, trying to scavenge things to sell elsewhere. Vendors from nearby villages spread out pro-farmer badges on blankets and curious onlookers from nearby areas come to see what's going on.

But all this belies the serious reason why they're there -- that for many this is a matter of life or death.

Farmers say the new laws aimed at bringing more market freedom to the industry will make it easier for corporations to exploit agricultural workers -- and leave them struggling to meet the minimum price that they were guaranteed for certain crops under the previous rules.

And while the mood within the camp is calm and relaxed, there's a constant reminder that not everyone supports the farmers' fight.

Large barricades erected by the police and topped with barbed wire stand a few hundred meters from the hubbub of camp life, hemming the farmers in and keeping them from encroaching any closer to the center of Delhi. Security forces line the sides of the camp, keeping watch for any trouble, although they have not tried to clear the camp -- likely because it would be politically unpopular.

The farmers say the barricades make them seem like outsiders -- like they are foreigners in their own land who don't belong here.

""The government is treating us like we are Chinese, sitting on the other side of the fence,"" Kuldeep Singh said, referring to the tense border dispute currently taking place between India and China in the Himalayas.

Difficulty for protesters

As the months have worn on, protesting has become harder.

The winter temperatures have dropped to below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Farenheit) at night. And tensions have ramped up during the protests. Last week, internet access was blocked in several districts of a state bordering India's capital following violent clashes between police and farmers there protesting the controversial agricultural reforms.

The government has been criticized not only for the controversial farm laws themselves, but also how it has handled the demonstrations. At the end of January, India's main opposition party, the Congress Party, and 15 other opposition parties, said Prime Minister Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) party have been ""arrogant, adamant and undemocratic in their response.""

""(Hundreds and thousands) of farmers have been ... braving biting cold and heavy rain for the last 64 days for their rights and justice,"" they wrote in a joint statement. ""The government remains unmoved and has responded with water cannons, tear gas and lathi charges. Every effort has been made to discredit a legitimate mass movement through government sponsored disinformation campaign.""

According to Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of protesting farmers, at least 147 farmers have died during the course of the monthslong protests from a range of causes, including suicide, road accidents and exposure to cold weather. Authorities have not given an official figure on protester deaths.

Nevertheless, farmers are continuing to arrive at the camps, Samyukta Kisan Morcha said earlier this week.

""Typically these village groups work against each other but this time they have all united for the collective fight,"" said Paramjeet Singh Katyal, a spokesperson for Samyukta Kisan Morcha.

What happens next

Protests are fairly common in India, the world's largest democracy. And it's not the first time that large protests have rocked the country. In 2019, India's parliament passed a controversial bill that gave Indian citizenship to immigrants from three neighboring countries, but not if they are Muslim, prompting mass demonstrations.

But these protests are a particular challenge for Modi.

Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for 58% of India's 1.3 billion population, making farmers the biggest voter block in the country. Angering the farmers could lose Modi a significant chunk of votes at the next general election in 2024. Modi and his government continue to insist that they are supporting farmers, and called the new laws as a ""watershed moment"" which will ensure a complete transformation of the agriculture sector. Besides calling the move long overdue, Modi has not said why he opted to introduce these measures during the pandemic, which has caused India to suffer its first recession in decades.

In a statement issued this week, the Indian government said that the protests ""must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, and the ongoing efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse,"" and that certain measures, such as the temporary internet block, were ""undertaken to prevent further violence.""

The camps have also created a headache for nearby commuters and trucks bringing food into Delhi -- people who would have traveled on the expressway at Ghazipur are forced to take different routes, sometimes doubling their travel time.

But the farmers are showing no interest in backing down.

A farmer sports a protest slogan meaning ""I love farmers"" at a protest camp in Ghazipur, on February 4, 2021.

Rounds of talks have failed to make any headway. Although the Supreme Court put three contentious farm orders on hold last month and ordered the formation of a four-member mediation committee to help the parties negotiate, farmers' leaders have rejected any court-appointed mediation committee.

Last month, central government offered to suspend the laws for 1.5 years -- but to farmers, all of this is not far enough.

Sanjit Baliyan, 25, has been at the camp for over a month, working at the supply tent. He points out that farmers have done a lot for Modi's government, only for Modi to introduce a law that removes any minimum prices for their stocks.

""We haven't spoken against the government for last seven years. But, if we are at receiving end, we will have to speak,"" he said.

Some, like 50-year-old farmer Babu Ram, want the protests to end. ""A prolonged protest is neither good for the farmers nor for the government. The protest, if it's stretched, will create a ruckus.""

But he added: ""This protest will only end once the government agrees to our demands ... we have to stay here till the end.""

While Kuldeep Singh agrees that there's hardship -- farmers' households have cut their own consumption to contribute to the protest camps -- he says farmers will only leave once the laws are repealed. ""We will sit here for the next three years. We will sit till the elections, till the laws are scrapped."""
"Two House Republicans fined $5,000 each for not completing security screening to enter House floor","(CNN) Two Republican lawmakers are the first members of Congress to be fined for violating the new security measures off of the House floor since the fines were instated earlier this week, CNN has learned.

Republican Reps. Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Louie Gohmert of Texas have both been fined $5,000 for not following the new security protocols. The fines, which are meant to punish members who fail to complete security screenings prior to entering the House floor, will be deducted from members' salaries by the chief administrative officer, according to the new rule passed Tuesday. A second offense will result in a $10,000 fine.

Clyde refused to go through the metal detectors as he entered the House floor, CNN has learned, while Gohmert left the House floor to go to the bathroom and did not stop to be screened a second time.

Gohmert told CNN he left the House floor Thursday night to go to the bathroom and did not think he had to be screened in order to return to the floor.

""I went through the metal detector perfectly properly. And as I've done for weeks ever since the metal detectors have been here, I was about to speak so I came to the restroom, and I've never been wanded or anything because they can see you go in and see you come out. And they said, because I didn't stop and get wanded, I went and spoke. They made it sound like I avoided the metal detectors,"" Gohmert told CNN.

Man spends seven days stranded after his GPS directed him to an unplowed mountain pass,"(CNN) A man who became stranded during heavy snow in the backcountry of California's Sierra Nevada mountains for a week after following the directions on his GPS was rescued alive after surviving on a small supply of food and melted snow.

Harland Earls, 29, was traveling from Grass Valley to Truckee for a birthday party on January 24, a drive that would typically take less than two hours, when a heavy snowstorm shut down Interstate 80. Seeking an alternate route, Earls turned to his GPS, according to the Sierra County Sheriff's Office

The device directed Earls to the shortest route on the map. But the GPS didn't account for Henness Pass Road being an unplowed mountain pass and Earls ended up being stuck for days in snow so deep he was unable turn his vehicle around, the sheriff's office said.

""The GPS doesn't know if there's six feet of snow on a road or if the road is clear and passable,"" Sierra County Sheriff Mike Fisher told CNN.

Stuck and unable to obtain a cell phone signal, Earls tried tying small branches to the tires of his pickup truck to gain some traction, his mother, Julie Earls told CNN. In the process, his cell phone got wet and stopped working. The resourceful man found some dry spaghetti noodles and handwarmer packets in his truck, and popped them into a Ziploc bag with his phone. It took three days, but the phone finally dried out enough to for him to charge it and make a call. But finding cell service wasn't as easy.

Kevin McCarthy emerges with a tight grip on House Republicans after tumultuous week,"Washington (CNN) House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy began this week facing perhaps the biggest challenge of his time as leader. He emerged at the end of it having survived but not unscathed. While he has a tighter grip on his conference than before, others in the Republican establishment are concerned about the long-term health of the GOP and have sharply questioned his leadership.

McCarthy's task was to keep an angry, fractious conference together in the face of growing animus toward two very different members -- Reps. Liz Cheney and Marjorie Taylor Greene. McCarthy, according to people on Capitol Hill familiar with his thinking, went into the week with one goal: no blood. That meant not taking sides between the establishment and pro-Trump wings of the party. The challenge was to save both wings and keep them unified.

To achieve this, McCarthy did what many Republicans outside of the House conference had long criticized him for -- not taking a firm enough stand on certain issues and allowing individual members to drive the conversation, even when they were espousing conspiracies and pushing the lie that the election was stolen from Donald Trump.

While some Republicans saw his hands-off approach as a sign of weakness, the style was aimed at keeping the conference intact, even if some of the Republicans' dirty laundry had to be aired in public.

But by Friday, it was clear the Republican leader's strategy had paid off. The GOP conference was unified and his own position inside it was secure.

""You elected me leader,"" McCarthy told the conference at the end of their hours-long meeting Wednesday night. ""Let me lead.""

The speech was greeted with raucous applause.

McCarthy brought Republicans together in part by letting many of his members air their grievances against Cheney for her impeachment vote before getting the vast majority of the conference to support her staying in the leadership. He also pushed the thorny issue of removing Greene from her committee assignments onto the House Democratic majority, which they did on Thursday

For many House Republicans, the episode was a triumph for McCarthy.

""He did a great job, I actually congratulated him today,"" Rep. Darrell Issa of California, a conservative, told CNN Friday.

""When you're a leader in a conference like this, that's diverse, and you're going to have diverse opinions, and they've got to try to thread that needle,"" said Rep. John Katko, a moderate from New York. ""I think they did the best they could under the circumstances.""

McCarthy did however manage to anger one key constituent. According to a source familiar, a stir-crazy Trump has spent the last two days livid and fuming to aides and allies about what he views as a betrayal by McCarthy for standing by Cheney and not punishing her for her vote to impeach. This just over a week after McCarthy made an appeal to Trump by visiting him down at Mar-a-Lago and extracting a public commitment that the former President will work to elect a Republican House majority in 2022.

Trump isn't the only Republican disappointed with McCarthy. Many in the establishment were looking for a more direct and stinging rebuke of Greene from the GOP leader. They worry failure to do so has damaged the party's ability to win by tying its brand to a conspiracy theorist.

""Kevin never takes a stand, he is always on every side of every issue,"" said one influential Republican adviser, who called the episode a ""huge embarrassment and failure of leadership.""

""Does he want to be the Republican party or the QAnon party?"" the adviser added.

For McCarthy, however, it's a matter of balancing competing views.

""The Republicans Leader McCarthy wakes up every day to fight for are the Republicans in our conference and their constituents,"" said McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks. ""Our conference is united and moving forward on their behalf.""

Tolerating lies about the election

McCarthy's unity play has come at the cost of tolerating and even participating in lies about a stolen election and other conspiracy theories.

McCarthy was quiet when Republicans like Rep. Mo Brooks were leading the charge seeking to overturn the elections on Jan. 6, privately greenlighting their efforts and ultimately voting with them on the House floor to discard the electoral results of two states Joe Biden won -- hours after pro-Trump demonstrators stormed the Capitol seeking to stop the congressional certification of Biden's win.

He was also quiet about House Republicans' legal brief backing the Texas lawsuits seeking to invalidate millions of votes in key battleground states, before ultimately signing onto the effort himself. And he refused to acknowledge Biden's victory until more than two months after it was clear that the Democrat had won.

All of that has given McCarthy a reputation as an indecisive leader unwilling to take a strong stand and willing to turn a blind eye to even the most egregious actions by Trump. But in so doing, he has gained strong backing from the dominant pro-Trump wing of his conference -- with no clear challengers who could seek to oust him from the job or bid to take the Speaker's gavel if the GOP wins the majority next year.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) walks from his office to the House floor at the U.S. Capitol on February 4, 2021 in Washington, DC.

Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a favorite of the Freedom Caucus and pro-Trump wing who challenged McCarthy in 2018, told CNN Friday there is ""zero possibility"" he will run against McCarthy for Speaker if Republicans win the majority next year.

""I'm focused on winning back the majority,"" Jordan said.

During the four-hour-plus venting session on Wednesday, McCarthy recalled a story about how he and Jordan were at odds and have since reconciled. And he made a plea to give him the leadership team he needs, including Cheney, to help the GOP retake the majority.

Not every House Republican is enthusiastic about McCarthy's leadership.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, a staunch Trump ally who sought Cheney's ouster, wouldn't say if he has confidence in McCarthy's leadership; nor would Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington Republican who voted to impeach Trump.

On Wednesday, some aired their grievances about McCarthy himself -- namely how he handled his meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Trump.

""There were a number of members that thought it was inappropriate,"" Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, told CNN.

Griping from the establishment

There was, and remains, plenty of skepticism from some Republicans of McCarthy's ability to juggle the demands of an unwieldy House Republican conference.

McCarthy is known as a member's member -- a glad-hander who asks about his fellow Republicans' kids by name and remembers their wedding anniversaries. It's a trait that has served him well, first as a member of the GOP whip team and later as the whip himself.

And for years, McCarthy has been intimately involved in the House Republicans' candidate recruitment efforts as well as its fundraising -- meaning a large chunk of the GOP conference is made up of people he directly helped get elected.

But the 8-term Californian has not been known as a strategic thinker, especially when compared to his Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell. Republicans who know him say McCarthy is more inclined to seek conciliation and the path of least conflict.

That trait was on display in the deferential way he dealt with Greene. In one conversation with a senior Republican, according to a source familiar with the situation, McCarthy was advised to be very specific with Greene when they met to discuss her future -- to ask her directly whether she still agreed with the controversial comments she made and to go through them one by one. Without a full recant and public apology to the conference, the senior Republican told McCarthy, he would have to remove Greene.

""You don't speak to Marjorie Taylor Greene,"" said the influential Republican adviser. ""You take action and remove her.""

US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, answers questions from the media during a press conference on Capitol Hill on February 5, 2021 in Washington, DC.

But McCarthy was less inclined to do so after he met with Greene on Tuesday. According to one person with knowledge of the conversation, Greene was cordial and seemed to acknowledge she had put the conference in a difficult spot.

On Wednesday morning, McCarthy made a final appeal to his Democratic counterpart, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. Hoyer had the votes to oust Greene from her two committees, and Democrats were prepared to do so over her lies and conspiracy theorizing -- including her claim the 2018 Parkland school shooting was a ""false flag"" operation by supporters of tighter gun laws.

McCarthy offered this compromise to forestall a floor vote: Given the offense she caused to the Parkland victims, take Greene off the Education and Labor committee and place her on the Small Business committee. But Hoyer declined the offer, and McCarthy was left with no choice. Republicans wouldn't remove her, but they couldn't stop the Democratic majority.

For some outside the conference, this was a major embarrassment. The Republican adviser told CNN that by not punishing Greene himself, McCarthy was effectively allowing the majority to decide whether a member of the minority party can serve on a committee.

""How embarrassing is that?"" said the adviser.

Greene would speak to the conference that night, where she struck an apologetic tone that seemed to satisfy enough of her GOP colleagues. But that speech, and a Thursday floor speech before the House vote, did not prevent 11 Republicans from joining every Democrat in stripping Greene of her assignments. But the fear among House Republicans that even more would break and vote to punish Greene was abated.

A look to the midterms

While the midterm elections are 21 months away, McCarthy allies view his actions as trying to prevent a potentially disastrous divide within the party. For McCarthy, dealing with both Cheney and Greene put him at risk of alienating everyone at once.

""We could have splintered really badly this week,"" Rep. Cole told CNN Friday.

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) attends a congressional tribute to the late Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick who lies in honor in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on February 3, 2021 in Washington, DC.

The establishment, including Sen. McConnell and several donors, backed Cheney and wanted the party to rebuke Greene in the strongest of terms. The pro-Trump Freedom Caucus, channeling the GOP's base, had their knives out for Cheney and circled the wagons around Greene.

In turn McCarthy sought a middle path that might satisfy the establishment while validating the party's base -- an optimal outcome, if it works.

Denver Riggleman, the former Republican congressman from Virginia who remains close to many of his old colleagues, said McCarthy is primarily driven by political considerations.

""Kevin's calculus is, what does the polling look like in those districts and the fundraising in those districts,"" Riggleman said. ""He's trying to read the tea leaves and bouncing back and forth to what he's hearing from the polling in the districts.""

Others say it's clear the minority leader has cast his lot wholly with the most strident members of the House GOP.

""Kevin has been co-opted by [Jim] Jordan and the Freedom Caucus,"" said Charlie Dent, another former Republican congressman and a CNN contributor. ""If he punishes MTG, those guys turn on him and withhold Speaker votes just like they did in 2015. McCarthy's failure to punish MTG makes it harder to win swing districts and therefore the majority. He put himself in a box.""

McCarthy is also facing significant blowback from establishment Republicans, with some saying his recent moves will have severe consequences for the party and that he has sabotaged his own career.

""Any talk of the speakership is now a joke,"" the Republican adviser said.

But a Republican strategist tells CNN that McCarthy was in no position to simply cast Greene aside, since she has already proven herself to be a strong draw for the Republican base.

""Greene has been raising big small-dollar cash and is one of only a few people (Trump base) voters see as fighting,"" said this strategist."
Kroger will provide a one-time payment to employees who get a Covid-19 vaccine,"Kristoffer Tripplaar/Sipa/AP

The Kroger company announced it will provide a one-time payment of $100 to all employees who receive the full manufacturer-recommended doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.

In addition to the vaccine payment, the company is also giving a ""Thank You"" reward to associates, including a $100 store credit and 1,000 fuel points for hourly frontline grocery, supply chain, manufacturing, pharmacy, and call center associates.

Associates who are not able to take the vaccine due to medical or religious reasons will have the option of completing an education health and safety course to receive payment, a company news release said.

“Since March, we have invested more than $1.5 billion to both reward our associates and to safeguard our associates and customers through the implementation of dozens of safety measures that we continue to execute today. We’ve also welcomed more than 100,000 new associates to The Kroger Family of Companies. As we move into a new phase of the pandemic, we’re increasing our investment to not only recognize our associates’ contributions, but also encourage them to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as it becomes available to them to optimize their well-being as well as the community’s,” Tim Massa, Kroger's senior vice president and chief people officer, said in the release.

The company is also playing a large part in vaccine distribution across the country. As of Feb. 5, Kroger Health professionals have administered more than 200,000 Covid-19 vaccines to essential health care workers, skilled-nursing facility employees and residents and some elderly populations."
February 5 coronavirus news,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, DC, on January 21. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images

Covid-19 cases are showing a slight decline in the United States, but this doesn't mean it's because vaccinations have been taking place. Instead, it's because the surge that came with holiday season activities is stabilizing, Dr. Anthony Fauci explained.

""I don't think that the fact that we're beginning to vaccinate people has yet contributed to that slight decline, because we haven't vaccinated enough people yet,"" Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on MSNBC's ""The Beat"" Friday.

Here's a quick rundown:

In early January, the 7-day moving average reached 250,000 cases per day.

cases per day. This week, the 7-day moving average this week stayed below 150,000 cases per day.

cases per day. New cases of Covid-19 were down by 15% from last week.

""What I think is going on, a combination of the natural peaking, as well as people doubling down on the public health measure,"" Fauci said. ""I believe it's entirely conceivable that a combination of continuing with that trend, as well as we get more and more people vaccinated, as we go from February, to March, to April, I think you're going to see that [cases] continue to come way down.""

Fauci also said that right now ""the only wild card"" is that we have Covid-19 variants in the country."
Biden says he doesn't think $15 minimum wage will survive in his Covid-19 relief proposal,"(CNN) President Joe Biden conceded that he does not believe he will be able to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour through his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief proposal due to the Senate's rules.

""I put it in, but I don't think it's going to survive,"" Biden told ""CBS Evening News with Norah O'Donnell"" in excerpts of an interview that aired Friday. The interview with CBS is his first for network television since taking office and the full interview will air on Sunday.

The President, who campaigned on raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, said he was prepared ""on a separate negotiation on minimum wage, to work my way up.""

""No one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage. And if you're making less than $15 an hour, you're living below the poverty wage,"" Biden said.

Both chambers of Congress on Friday passed a budget resolution that sets the stage for Democrats to be able to use a process known as ""budget reconciliation"" to pass Biden's sweeping Covid-19 relief bill on a party-line vote.

"Dianne Durham, the first Black national champion of US gymnastics, dies at 52","(CNN) At just 14 years old, Dianne Durham stood before thousands of spectators on the biggest stage in American gymnastics.

She'd just hurt her foot in an earlier, near-perfect balance beam routine -- but she wasn't thinking about the pain, she told a CBS reporter. She'd been ""having too much fun to let it bother"" her, she said.

She didn't let the pressure of being one of the only Black competitors at the 1983 Gymnastics Championships of the USA bother her either -- she was poised to become its first Black champion.

Dressed in a purple patterned leotard, Durham paused on the mat, took a deep breath -- and then she leapt.

In under two minutes, she breezed through an effortless floor routine, soaring through the air with the grace of a trained dancer and the strength of someone much older. Finishing with a double twist, she landed with her arms raised in victory.

The crowd roared. Fans holding a large banner that read ""We love Dianne"" rose to their feet.

Durham's overall performance earned her four gold medals and the distinction of being the first Black gymnast to become the US all-around champion.

Durham does a flip during individual final competition of the balance beam at the 1983 USA national gymnastic championship.

That remarkable performance is rarely mentioned among the seminal moments of US women's gymnastics. But her career, however brief, still set a precedent for the Black gymnasts and Olympians who would follow.

Durham, who went on to become a gymnastics coach, died Thursday, USA Gymnastics confirmed . Her husband, Tom Drahozal, told CNN that the 52-year-old died after a short illness.

""Her personality was bubbly and she was a very charismatic individual who was respected and admired by a lot of people,"" Drahozal said. ""Whether highest level or recreation class, all the students admired her because she treated them all the same.""

From national champion to retiree

A native of Gary, Indiana, Durham moved to Houston, Texas, as a teen to train with gymnastics coach Béla Károlyi at the Károlyi Ranch (now infamous for being one of the sites where former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar sexually abused young girls , decades after Durham's stint there).

At the ranch, she trained alongside future greats, including Mary Lou Retton, who told CBS Sports in a 1983 interview that though the two were friends, Durham was her ""best competition.""

Durham bested Retton at the 1983 championship with her immaculate performance. Károlyi embraced her afterward as national TV cameras focused on her surprised, ecstatic reaction.

Her appearance at the championships should've been the start to a storied career that would put her along the likes of Retton and other gymnasts from that era, when women gymnasts in the US started to become international stars and Olympians.

But Durham's Olympic dreams ended with an ankle injury in the trials for the 1984 Olympics. She believed Károlyi would petition to include her in the training group since she couldn't finish the trials, she told ESPN in a 2020 interview , but since she was kept from competing in the world championships that year, she was disqualified from the Olympics.

""The city of Gary was behind me 100,000%, and I felt like I let my family down,"" she told ESPN. ""Everybody uprooted their lives for me.""

Retton made the Olympic team and won gold. Durham, still a teen, retired from the sport in 1985.

Her career set a standard for Black gymnasts

Black women and girls would go on to become Olympic gymnasts, including Dominique Dawes , who in 1996 became the first Black gymnast to win an individual event at the Olympics. In 2012, Gabby Douglas became the first Black gymnast to become the Olympics' all-around champion. And since her debut in 2016, Simone Biles has been hailed as the best gymnast the sport's ever seen.

The three women who succeeded Durham tumbled and twirled and broke records while overcoming racial bias and prejudice in a sport previously dominated by White women. That much hasn't changed in the almost 40 years since she competed, Durham wrote on Facebook.

""In my own life and gymnastics career I encountered discrimination and prejudice,"" she wrote on Facebook in June, days after George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police. ""It didn't stop me from reaching all of my goals, but it did play a role in preventing me from reaching some of my biggest goals.""

But when she was competing as a teen, she said, she never once thought about the history she could make as the first Black national champion.

""Do you know how many people had to tell me that?"" she told ESPN. ""I could not understand why that was such a humongous deal.""

It took time for Durham to absorb the weight of her achievements -- something that wasn't easy to do, considering how quickly she was shunned from the spotlight.

But she continued to work in gymnastics, eventually coaching, judging and running her own gym, Skyline Gymnastics, in Chicago, close to her hometown of Gary, USA Gymnastics reported

Durham and her husband lived in Chicago until her death.

In 2017, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Region 5 gymnastics, the division of USA Gymnastics that covers parts of the Midwest. She's ineligible for the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame -- it's open only to those who've won a medal in the Olympics or world championships.

""As an icon and trailblazer in our sport, Dianne opened doors for generations of gymnasts who came after her, and her legacy carries on each day in gyms across the country,"" USA Gymnastics CEO Li Li Leung said in a statement.

Durham loved gymnastics, even if the sport and its gatekeepers didn't always reciprocate, and when she was on the mat, she spun through the air with the ease of a champion."
"An invisible, odorless gas is pitting Texas against the Biden administration","Odessa, Texas (CNN) Deep in the heart of Texas, above an oil patch about the size of Kansas, a little team in a small plane is trying to reveal a big problem.

They are methane hunters. With an infrared camera and a Picarro Cavity Ring-Down Laser Spectroscope, they fly spirals over pumps and compressor stations that stretch to both horizons. With each tight corkscrew, the little airplane sniffs out and measures planet-cooking, climate-changing pollution as the region below braces for an energy revolution amid a cold civil war.

The Picarro spectrometer is so sensitive, it caught the number of carbon dioxide molecules in my breath as we walked around the hangar. In the sky, it counts the density of carbon dioxide molecules on their way to heating up the sea, land and sky for the next 300 to 1,000 years

More importantly, it also measures methane, which is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the next 20 years. You know it better as natural gas. Heating and cooking are not the only methane culprits. Two-thirds of emissions come from belching cows, factory farms and rotting landfills. But as any Texan will tell you, it's a lot easier to control gas coming out of the ground than gas coming out of cows.

The ""greenhouse effect"" was discovered before women could vote ( by a suffragist, in fact ) but in 2021, the indoor gardening metaphor doesn't match the emergency. Instead, imagine a baby in a hot car. Carbon dioxide is like the steel and glass holding in the sun's rays as they bounce through the windshield. Methane provides the equivalent of cranking up the heater inside the car; it works much faster but is easier to control in the long term. Planet Earth, of course, is the baby.

Without the tools of a methane hunter, you can't see or smell natural gas but virtually all of Earth's peer-reviewed scientists agree that for life on Earth to survive with any semblance of today, it must go the way of the dodo along with coal and oil. Climatologists at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tell us that deadly changes will only get worse until people stop using fuels that burn and leak.

But in Texas, methane is so plentiful and cheap, it escaped largely unseen and unmeasured until both the Environmental Defense Fund and oil producers started using tools like the Picarro spectrometer. Scientific Aviation , based in Boulder, Colorado, owns this one and will sniff the sky for all kinds of customers, but only the EDF makes the data public.

Mackenzie Smith, a senior scientist with Scientific Aviation, checks readings from the instruments that measure gases like methane in the atmosphere.

""What we found here in the Permian Basin is that operators are wasting enough gas to heat about 2 million homes a year,"" says Kelsey Robinson, project manager for the EDF's PermianMAP Project

Sometimes the methane leaks from faulty equipment or the tens of thousands of orphaned wells. Sometimes, when there is no one to buy it, they just burn it in a practice called flaring. Former President Donald Trump tried to remove all regulations on methane, a move so extreme that even ExxonMobil opposed it. But until President Joe Biden's Environmental Protection Agency can navigate the legal booby traps left by the Trump administration's giveaways to methane leakers , it is up to oil and gas companies to fix a problem no one can see or smell.

""We found that the Permian Basin is emitting more than double any other oil and gas region in the United States,"" Robinson said.

Banning all bans

Named after Earth's biggest mass extinction event, the Permian Basin is so flat you'd swear you can see the curvature of Earth standing in the bed of a pickup. When oily, gassy, flammable proof of the Great Dying — the nickname given to the mass-extinction event that marked the end of the Permian geologic period — was found under the red dirt, Midland and Odessa grew into the vena cava of the state's oil industry, the setting for ""Friday Night Lights"" and the perfect place for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to fire the first shot in a methane civil war of 2021.

The Permian Basin, which covers most of West Texas, is flat, wide open and sits atop of a lot of oil.

""I'm in Midland to make clear that Texas is going to protect the oil and gas industry from any type of hostile attack launched from Washington, DC,"" Abbott said, days after Biden signed his first round of executive orders aimed at a climate in crisis

Then the Republican governor signed an executive order of his own, commanding every state agency to bring him every reason to sue and stop the Biden administration's clean energy efforts. In calling out cities like San Francisco, where a movement to ban natural gas heaters and appliances from new construction is growing, Abbott vowed to ban all bans.

""In Texas, we will not let cities use political correctness to dictate what energy source you use,"" he said. ""So I am supporting legislation that prohibits cities and counties from banning natural gas appliances.""

But as a sign of the changing times, Abbott's fierce opposition to the Paris Accord puts him at odds with the statements and soundbites of Big Oil's biggest lobbyist.

""We think the threat of climate change is very real,"" Mike Sommers, CEO of the American Petroleum Institute (API), told CNN. ""We support both industry actions and actions by the federal government in the United States and around the globe to address this very important issue that we know is existential in nature.""

As more European energy companies embrace a green transition, France's Total became the first oil giant to tear up its API membership , citing differences over a carbon tax, electric car subsidies and ... methane. In October, the French government stepped in to block a $7 billion deal, deciding that liquified natural gas from Texas is too dirty for their standards.

But Sommers says the API is willing to work with the Biden administration on regulating new and existing sources of methane.

A call for more pipelines

As for Biden being an existential threat to oil and gas, Sommers seems less worried and argues that there is no need to transition them to geothermal, solar or wind because the world will demand fuels that burn and leak for generations.

""This industry provides about 60% of the world's energy today,"" he said. ""And the trend there is going to be a transition in energy. But I'm also confident that this industry is going to be around for a long time.""

Signs of old and new power: an oil pumpjack sits among wind turbines outside of Odessa, Texas.

To fix the methane problem, he argues that if America only had more pipelines, industry wouldn't have to needlessly burn so much natural gas.

""I think the biggest challenge that we have from an emissions perspective, honestly, is getting our infrastructure right,"" Sommers said. ""We need to make sure that we have pipelines in place to get these products to market as quickly as possible. And what that means is we need a regulatory structure that allows these pipelines to be built.""

Kelsey Robinson of the EDF has a simpler idea. ""Reducing methane emissions is actually a job creator in and of itself because we need people to go out to survey these sites and then take steps to fix those leaks.""

""It doesn't make sense to burn it,"" said Texas state geologist Scott Tinker as we stroll the elaborate rock garden map of Texas outside his office. ""They don't have the gathering systems to collect it. So rather than leaking the methane, they burn it and leak CO2. CO2 is better as a product than methane if you're going to put something into the atmosphere. But it'd be much better to gather it.""

Scott Tinker, state geologist of Texas, agrees it would be better to gather the methane but says progress can be slow.

After the 2008 recession, Tinker says the fracking boom caught West Texas by surprise. Years of oil field decline saw a renaissance when the new method of injecting water into shale doubled oil production and created gushers of invisible methane with no way to catch it.

""The conversation is shifting,"" Tinker says, after public and stockholder pressure. ""It's happening, but it's slow, takes a lot of money, takes approval for the pipelines. It takes an industry and a regulatory system that caused that to happen in the first place.""

Sommers insists that his API members are taking the problem seriously, with 70% of onshore producers joining the Environmental Partnership , which is all about reducing methane emissions within the oil and gas industry, he said.

""It brings together producers, large and small, to share technology and to share best practices on how to reduce methane emissions,"" he said. ""And it's working.""

But far beyond the methane problem, the only way to save both life on Earth and the fossil fuel industry is to rabidly develop carbon capture and storage technology on a mind-boggling scale. This would require sophisticated, expensive methane catchers to be built around the smokestacks of every petrochemical works, power plant and steel mill in the world.

Hopes for such a miracle fix took a major setback this week, when the Petra Nova plant outside of Houston shut down indefinitely. Backed by a $190 million grant from the Department of Energy, the four-year plant set out to capture 90% of the carbon dioxide pumping out of a 240-megawatt, coal-fired power plant. It was the only major carbon-capture project in the U.S. after a $7.5 billion project in Mississippi was shuttered before ever going online.

Exxon Mobil says they are working on 20 new carbon capture projects around the world, including one in Texas, as part of a new $3 billion investment in a business they call ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions.

This plane operated by Scientific Aviation is equipped with technology to measure climate-changing gases like methane.

But Robinson and her flying methane hunters have heard promises before. Without enforceable regulations for producers big and small, she says profit motive almost always wins.

""ExxonMobil and some of the other big producers have set some pretty lofty goals for how they want to keep their emissions,"" Robinson said. ""But we found that here in the Permian Basin, the methane leak rate is over 10 times higher than what a lot of companies have set out to do.""

In the meantime, she says she'll keep her little team flying, sniffing and measuring methane while the airplane will soon have some high-altitude backup. After a $100 million grant from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' Earth Fund, the EDF will soon launch their own methane-hunting satellite."
"Canada extends cruise ship ban to 2022. That's bad news for Alaska tourism, too","(CNN) — People who have been hoping to cruise the northern waters of North America this summer will have to place their travel dreams in dry dock for now.

Because of the worsening Covid-19 pandemic, Canada has extended its cruise ship ban until February 2022. That affects popular voyage destinations in Canada, including the St. Lawrence River and Maritime Provinces on the Atlantic side to British Columbia along the Pacific Coast.

But the ban extension is also going to hit Alaska and even Seattle, Washington, hard through a combination of geographical proximity and US maritime rules.

What Canada is doing -- and why

On Thursday, Canadian Minister of Transport Omar Alghabra announced the interim orders that ban pleasure craft in its Arctic waters and cruise vessels in all Canadian waters until February 28, 2022.

The government said ""passenger vessels carrying more than 12 people are still prohibited from entering Arctic coastal waters. ... Pleasure craft used by local Arctic residents will not be affected by these measures.""

But the bigger vacation impact will be for folks who enjoy the big cruise ship experience. Cruise ships that ferry more than 100 passengers will still be prohibited from operating in Canadian waters.

It's notable that there's no ban on ""smaller cruise ships certified to carry 100 or fewer people.""

""As Canadians continue to do their part to reduce the spread of Covid-19, our government continues to work hard to ensure Canada's transportation system remains safe,"" Alghabra said in the government's statement. ""Temporary prohibitions to cruise vessels and pleasure craft are essential to continue to protect the most vulnerable among our communities.""

If the pandemic situation ""sufficiently improves,"" Alghabra could rescind orders earlier than February 2022.

How this affects US tourism

Because of geographical proximity, Alaska and Seattle are inexorably tied to their international neighbor. Routes featuring ports such as Seattle, Victoria (Canada), Sitka, Juneau and Glacier Bay have been very popular for decades.

But it's not just geography that will hurt the US cruise industry. It's the way maritime law works that gives the ban its sting for America, too.

The Passenger Vessel Services Act allows only vessels flying a US flag to transport passengers directly from one US port to another. All others must make a stop at a foreign port.

And there lies the rub -- big cruise lines tend to register with foreign nations , not the United States.

For instance, Carnival has most of its ships registered in Panama. And while Holland America's headquarters are in Seattle, its ships carry the flag of the Netherlands.

So unless it is US-registered, a cruise ship that departs from Seattle for a trip to Alaska must first call at a Canadian port. Except for now, it can't.

The reaction

Alaska's Republican delegation to Congress -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Sen. Dan Sullivan and Rep. Don Young -- released a statement on Friday expressing strong disapproval of the move.

""As the state with the most extensive shared border with Canada, the Alaska delegation has worked in good-faith to seek compromise over border crossing restrictions due to Covid-19, keeping in mind the health and safety of Alaskans and Canadians,"" the statement read.

""Canada's announcement to ban all cruise sailings carrying 100 people or more traveling through Canadian waters, without so much as a courtesy conversation with the Alaska delegation, is not only unexpected — it is unacceptable — and was certainly not a decision made with any consideration for Alaskans or our economy. We expect more from our Canadian allies.""

They said they will pursue ""all potential avenues, including changing existing laws, to ensure the cruise industry in Alaska resumes operations as soon as it is safe.""

The news has been a blow in Alaska tourism circles.

""No matter who you talk to, it was a stunning morning,"" Julie Saupe, president and CEO of Visit Anchorage, told the Anchorage Daily News , the largest newspaper in Alaska.

""The extension of the 'no-sail' order in Canadian waters is likely to have large, negative implications for Alaska visitation in the coming summer,"" Saupe said in a written statement. She said cruises make up about 40% to 50% of overnight leisure visits to Alaska's largest city in the summer.

The Canadian announcement has a direct effect on Seattle's tourist economy. CNN

And CNN affiliate KIRO reported the fallout is being felt in Washington state's largest city.

""Each homeported vessel brings in over $4 million to the regional economy, $14.5 million in statewide taxes, and generates nearly one-billion dollars in business activity over the whole season,"" Port of Seattle spokesman Peter McGraw said in statement.

""We also hear from port cities in Alaska that losing another year of revenue could be cataclysmic. We urge our federal leaders to consider relief for all communities impacted by the declines in travel and tourism.""

Looking ahead to 2022

Meanwhile, cruise lines do seem to be optimistic for 2022 even if 2021 turns out to be a bust.

For instance, Holland America is offering a seven-day, Seattle-to-Alaska cruise with a stop in Victoria, Canada, in June 2022."
"Woman charged in US Capitol riot can take trip to Mexico, federal judge says","(CNN) A Texas florist charged in connection with the US Capitol insurrection will be allowed to go to Mexico later this month, a federal judge ruled Friday.

The case involving Jenny Cudd got national attention this week after she wrote to a judge asking for permission to visit Riviera Maya, Mexico, for a four-day retreat this month.

On Friday, Judge Trevor N. McFadden of the DC District Court granted her request. McFadden, a Trump appointee, noted that the Justice Department did not oppose Cudd's request to visit Mexico.

""The Court also notes (Cudd) has no criminal history and there is no evidence before the Court suggesting the Defendant is a flight risk or poses a danger to others,"" McFadden wrote in a written order.

Cudd is a flower shop owner and unsuccessful mayoral candidate from Midland, Texas. She was initially charged with two misdemeanors -- knowingly entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds -- and was released shortly after her arrest in January. Prosecutors later brought additional and more serious charges in a subsequent indictment.

NFL tells White House it's ready to make every stadium a vaccination site,"(CNN) Every NFL team will make its stadium available as a mass vaccination site, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a letter to President Joe Biden dated Thursday.

The offer comes as the Biden administration has promised the opening of mass vaccination sites as part of its push to ramp up the pace of Covid inoculations.

""This is currently being done at seven NFL stadiums today,"" Goodell wrote. ""We can expand our efforts to stadiums across the nation more effectively because many of our clubs have offered their facilities previously as COVID testing centers as well as election sites over the past several months.""

According to an NFL spokesman, the seven clubs that have already activated vaccination sites ""at or near their stadium"" are Arizona (State Farm Stadium), Atlanta (Mercedes-Benz Stadium), Baltimore (M&T Bank Stadium), Carolina (Bank of America Stadium), Houston (NRG Park), Miami (Hard Rock Stadium) and New England (Gillette Stadium).

The NFL has also been in communication with the White House regarding coronavirus response efforts on another front -- Sunday's Super Bowl. CNN reported earlier Thursday that the President and first lady Jill Biden have taped a video message thanking health care workers that will be shown before the game, according to a source familiar with the plans.

77-year-old woman rescued after being trapped inside her van for four days after winter storm,"(CNN) Firefighters in Newark, New Jersey, on Thursday rescued a 77-year-old woman who said she had been trapped inside her van for at least four days during this week's winter storm.

The woman was identified by CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey as Janet Ward, who is currently living in the vehicle. She told the station she had parked Sunday night before a snowplow blocked her in with snow.

""I was blowing the horn to tell them I was in here. But they didn't get the message, so I've been in here ever since,"" she said. Fortunately, she had food and water with her, the station reported.

However, officials said there was ""human error"" in logging the address she provided, and when police responded they were unable to find her blue mini-van. Authorities tried to contact her but were unsuccessful.

New Orleans closing bars and banning to-go drinks during Mardi Gras,"(CNN) — In a citywide crackdown, New Orleans announced on Friday that it will be ordering the closure of all indoor and outdoor bars and banning to-go drinks starting next Friday through Mardi Gras day on February 16.

During a news conference, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell called the large crowds seen on Bourbon Street last weekend ""unacceptable.""

Cantrell referred to the crowds as superspreader events, calling them dangerous and a risk to lives and the progress the city has made in stopping the spread of Covid-19.

In addition to indoor and outdoor bar closures, Cantrell said bars operating as restaurants will also be closed to the public. Packaged liquor sales will be prohibited in the French Quarter and the Central Business District, and all sales of to-go drinks will be banned during this time.

""I think we were all hopeful that we could strike the necessary balance for a safe and fun Mardi Gras, but given these new variants, the recent large crowds in the Quarter and the potential for even larger crowds this weekend and as we move into the weekend of Mardi Gras, it has become very apparent that it is hard to do"" Cantrell said.

The city's website also cited last year's Mardi Gras celebrations, where community spread of coronavirus caused New Orleans hospitals to reach capacity.

The mayor said she would rather be accused of doing too much than doing too little when it comes to the health and safety of the residents, especially hospitality workers.

The Mardi Gras closures have many businesses frustrated. Scott Wood, who owns Courtyard Brewery in the Lower Garden District, said this is probably the seventh or eighth time he's shuttered his business during the pandemic.

""The city had known Mardi Gras was going to be a problem for months and had no clear plan disseminated. For them to spring this on us a week out, while Mardi Gras festivities are already in swing, is unfortunate and frustrating,"" Wood said via email.

The new restrictions involving bars and alcohol sales will be in place from 6 a.m. Friday, February 12, through 6 a.m. Wednesday, February 17.

The Mardi Gras restrictions also include limiting vehicle and pedestrian traffic at certain times on busy streets including Bourbon Street, Frenchman Street and Decatur Street."
White House reinstates regular presidential addresses to the nation in the style of FDR's fireside chats,"(CNN) The White House is bringing back weekly addresses from the President directly to the American people, continuing in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats.

""This is a time-honored tradition in the country of hearing from the President in this way, from FDR's Fireside Chats to Ronald Reagan establishing the weekly presidential radio address,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday. ""President (Joe) Biden will continue that tradition, and we expect it to take on a variety of forms.""

Biden's inaugural edition features a ""conversation"" between him and Michele, a Roseville, California, resident who lost her job at a startup clothing company due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Psaki.

The reinstatement of the presidential addresses is another return by the Biden administration to presidential traditions and norms, including the resumption of daily White House press briefings.

In the video of his first "" weekly conversation "" posted Saturday, Biden, while seated in the Oval Office, offered Michele solace during their phone call and used the interaction to highlight his Covid relief plan -- the ""American Rescue Plan.""

"Mask mandates can work, CDC researchers say","(CNN) Mask mandates can work, according to research released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Friday.

One new study showed that, in places where state and local governments required mask use, fewer people ended up in the hospital with coronavirus. A second showed college students, at least, will overwhelmingly wear masks if there's a mandate in place.

Researchers from the CDC and University of Nevada, Las Vegas examined 10 sites in states that implemented mask mandates between March and October. They found the hospitalization rates fell in places where local leaders requires mask use.

Hospitalization growth rates declined by 5.5 percentage points among 18- to 64-year-olds in sites across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Oregon, the team said in the CDC's weekly report.

The sites began to see a significant decline in hospitalization rates among 40- to 64-year-olds less than three weeks after the mandates were implemented. Beyond three weeks, the declines were seen across 18- to 64-year-olds.

A 10-year-old boy and family friend cleaned snow off 80 hospital workers' cars during storm,"A Rhode Island fifth-grader and a family friend swept snow off dozens of hospital workers' cars during Monday's nor'easter to thank them for all their hard work during the coronavirus pandemic

Christian Stone, 10, and Abbey Meeker went to Westerly Hospital at around shift change, when doctors, nurses and other staff members were walking to the parking lot.

""We kind of made it a game,"" Meeker told CNN.

When drivers used their remotes to start or unlock their cars, the duo would rush over to the car and clean it off as quickly as possible.

Meeker, 29, says Christian came up with the idea during the last big snowstorm and she agreed to help him.

She's known Christian's mom since grade school and thinks of him as a little brother.

""Christian is wise beyond his years,"" she said. ""He's my little partner in crime.""

She said he likes to help people and had been shoveling neighbors' driveways for free before they went to the hospital in Westerly, about 45 miles southwest of Providence, on the border with Connecticut.

""I was thinking they've been helping us a lot through this whole pandemic, and I figured why don't we help them, you know?"" Christian told CNN affiliate WJAR . ""All day, every day the nurses here, they deal with the pandemic like Covid and they want to get home from work, so we thought we would make it a tiny bit easier for them by cleaning off their cars for them.""

One hospital worker said in a comment on the WJAR Facebook page that she wondered why her car was so clean when she left work on Tuesday morning.

""Only thing I had to do was [get] in and drive away!"" she wrote, adding that it took her three hours to drive home because of the weather.

Meeker said she really hates the snow and that they had to change clothes twice because they would get soaking wet in the freezing cold.

""If I had to do it by myself, I definitely would not have done it,"" she said. ""But I knew how much it meant to Christian so I sucked it up.""

She also said she knew a lot of people at the hospital and had gone out by herself earlier in the day to clean off cars for people on other shifts.

Meeker said they ended up cleaning off about 80 cars in four different employee parking lots.

Some people offered to pay, but they didn't want the money. Meeker said he did get $20 because two insistent nurses told him they'd be mad if he didn't accept it.

""It's been cold but extremely fun seeing how happy they get,"" said Stone. ""Some of them say, 'Thank you so much' and I'm just really happy to see them happy."""
Don't fall for these 4 money myths,"When it comes to managing your money, you've likely heard a lot of rules and advice.

""Spend less than you earn."" ""Start saving early for retirement."" ""Stick to a budget.""

But there are also a lot of misconceptions out there.

All debt is bad

Debt gets a bad rap, and we're often told that it should be avoided at all costs.

But there is such a thing as ""good debt"" -- debt that carries a low interest rate and can help build wealth over time.

The idea behind good debt is that it will bring future value, like taking out a mortgage or college loans.

But ""bad debt"" -- like credit cards that carry high interest rates -- can quickly put you in a financial hole.

""Credit card debt is one of the most dangerous things... way worse than investing poorly or saving money in the mattress,"" said Michael Resnick, a certified financial planner and senior wealth management advisor at GCG Financial.

And even with good debt, you don't want to overextend yourself: It can still become a problem if you can't afford the payments.

Debt plays a role in determining your credit score, which lenders use to assess your credit risk and what interest rate you will be charged. The higher the score, the better the terms, which saves you money on interest.

Renting is like throwing your money away

Buying a home can help build wealth as you hopefully build equity over time.

But becoming a homeowner doesn't always make financial sense.

""Buying a home can be a great investment in the long term, but it's not necessarily right for everyone,"" said Trina Patel, a financial advice manager at money management app Albert.

The homebuying process comes with many upfront costs, including the down payment and closing costs, as well as expenses beyond the mortgage like homeowners association fees, property taxes, insurance and any repairs.

For people who are only planning on living in an area for a few years, renting could make more financial sense.

""Why take the risk of actually losing money on the property in the short-term, not to mention the transaction costs of buying and selling?"" said Resnick.

You'll spend less money in retirement

You know all those things that you keep adding to your ""things I'll do when I retire"" list?

They'll likely cost money.

There's a general rule of thumb that you should aim to have around 80% of your annual pre-retirement salary. The idea is that you won't need to save anymore, your mortgage will be paid off, or you'll spend less if you're not going to work everyday, or so the thinking goes.

But for some, their retirement lifestyle could be even more expensive than their working years.

""We have several clients who spend more money in retirement because they finally have the time to travel or want to buy a home or want to help grandchildren's college funding,"" said Chad Chase, managing principal, client services, at Garrett Investment Advisors.

It's rude to talk about money

For some, talking about money is considered taboo.

But talking honestly about money with your partner can help establish spending and saving expectations.

""And if you have kids, keep them in the loop and teach them as early as you can about how to manage money,"" said Patel.

Money talks among your peers at work and your friends can also be beneficial.

Sharing your salary (or a range if you aren't totally comfortable giving an exact number) can help identify pay discrepancies and empower others to make sure they are getting paid their worth.

Talking about budgeting and savings tips among friends can help make the process seem less intimidating and shed light on tools and tricks to help everyone bolster their financial footing.

""There is a lot we can learn from each other once we start talking about money. When you have it all guarded, you don't know what you don't know or what else you could be doing,"" said Patel."
Hackers intercepted a Covid-19 vaccination appointment hotline in Pennsylvania,"(CNN) A hotline set up to help people in Pennsylvania's Allegheny County schedule Covid-19 vaccination appointments was partially compromised, county officials said.

The service opened at noon on Thursday to help residents 65 and older who lack internet access or need additional assistance, CNN affiliate KDKA reported. The county is home to Pittsburgh, the second-most populous city in the state.

At some point ""mid-afternoon,"" the county health department and the 2-1-1 service became aware that a hacker was intercepting callers and diverting them away from the helpline without their knowledge, according to a news release from the county.

Amazon loses attempt to delay milestone union vote at Alabama warehouse,"(CNN Business) Thousands of Amazon warehouse workers at an Alabama facility will be able to cast their votes on whether to unionize by mail-in ballots beginning next week after the National Labor Relations Board rejected the company's latest attempt to stall the vote by pushing for it to be held in-person, despite the pandemic.

In a decision posted Friday, the NLRB denied Amazon's motion filed in late January to review its earlier decision to hold the milestone vote for workers by mail. The NLRB said Amazon's request ""raises no substantial issues warranting review.""

Ballots are set to be mailed out Monday, February 8, and eligible workers at the Bessemer, Alabama facility will be able to vote over the course of nearly two months instead of through an in-person event, which may take place over one or several days.

""Once again Amazon workers have won another fight in their effort to win a union voice. Amazon's blatant disregard for the health and safety of its own workforce was demonstrated yet again by its insistence for an in-person election in the middle of the pandemic,"" said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) , which is conducting the union drive, in a statement. ""Today's decision proves that it's long past time that Amazon start respecting its own employees; and allow them to cast their votes without intimidation and interference.""

Amazon AMZN The union vote is a landmark moment for the Alabama facility and. While some Amazon workers are unionized in Europe, the company has so far fended off unions in the United States. A union election was held in 2014 at a Delaware warehouse, but resulted in workers largely rejecting the effort.

"Former Columbus, Ohio, police officer who shot Andre Hill pleads not guilty, bond set at $3M","(CNN) Adam Coy, the former Columbus, Ohio, police officer who shot and killed Andre Hill , entered a not guilty plea to a count of murder in the commission of a felony and other charges at his arraignment Friday.

Coy appeared virtually from Franklin County Jail -- wearing a tan jumpsuit and face mask -- and a judge set bond at $3 million and ordered that he have no contact with police officers or witnesses in his case.

The case centers on Coy's actions on December 22 while responding to a call about a man who had been sitting in his SUV for an extended period, repeatedly turning his engine on and off.

Coy fatally shot Hill, who was Black, within seconds of their encounter as Hill walked toward Coy while holding an illuminated cell phone in his left hand, body camera footage showed. Hill was unarmed.

A grand jury also indicted the former officer on felonious assault and two counts of dereliction of duty on Wednesday, according to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. Coy was arrested at his attorney's office that same afternoon.

The ex-cop only spoke to acknowledge to the judge that he could hear the proceeding.

His attorney, Mark Collins, cited his client's military service and asked the court to set bond of up to $250,000.

Collins said his client was not a flight risk. He called the proceedings a ""self defense case"" -- not a ""who done it"" -- to determine whether the level of force used by the officer was justifiable.

Prosecutor Anthony Pierson argued for a high bond, saying that Hill lost his life as a result of Coy's actions. Hill's family sat the courtroom's first row, behind the prosecutor.

The judge denied Collins' pleas to consider reducing the bond, saying the that ""based on everything that I've heard, that is the bond that I've set.""

The judge also set a separate $20,000 recognizance bond.

Hill's family not entirely satisfied with the indictment

On Thursday, Hill's family -- through attorney Ben Crump -- said they were ""relieved"" about the charges but not entirely ""satisfied"" with the indictment of the officer for killing a man carrying only his cell phone.

""The reason they are not satisfied is because we know, based on what has happened before in America, that when a white police officer kills an unarmed black person, that does not guarantee a conviction,"" Crump said.

The two dereliction of duty counts apply to Coy's failure to use his body camera and ""his failure to inform his fellow officer that he felt Andre Hill presented a danger,"" according to Yost.

Coy said Hill had a gun, report says

Coy turned on his body camera after the shooting. The camera's look-back feature captured 60 seconds of video, but no audio, prior to Coy turning it on.

The footage appeared to show Coy walking toward Hill, who moved toward the officer. Coy started shooting within a few seconds. It's not clear whether Hill or Coy said anything during their brief encounter because Coy had not activated his body camera.

The first few seconds of Coy's body camera video in which audio is available showed Coy ordering Hill to get his hands out to the side, ordering him to get on his stomach, and warning an officer to not get close because one of Hill's arms was under the car where he collapsed.

About 37 seconds after the shooting, Coy asked whether a medic was coming. A report from the Columbus police chief after the shooting said an officer who responded with Coy said she heard the ex-cop say he saw a gun, and that Coy yelled, ""There's a gun in his other hand! There's a gun in his other hand!""

Coy was fired in December. Columbus Police Chief Thomas Quinlan said at the time that the evidence provided ""solid rationale"" for Coy's termination."
"Christopher Plummer, Oscar winner and star of 'The Sound of Music,' dead at 91","(CNN) Christopher Plummer, the elegantly voiced, Oscar-winning actor perhaps most fondly remembered for ""The Sound of Music,"" died Friday at his home in Connecticut, his manager said in a statement. He was 91.

""Chris was an extraordinary man who deeply loved and respected his profession with great old fashion manners, self deprecating humor and the music of words,"" his longtime friend and manager Lou Pitt said in his statement to CNN. ""He was a National Treasure who deeply relished his Canadian roots. Through his art and humanity, he touched all of our hearts and his legendary life will endure for all generations to come.""

Democrats indicate they don't need Trump's testimony to make case at impeachment trial,"(CNN) House Democrats prosecuting the case against Donald Trump are signaling privately and publicly they will likely avoid a dramatic showdown with the former President and are unlikely to issue a subpoena compelling his testimony.

Democrats believe there is ample evidence, from video and other sources, showing Trump's clear intent to incite his supporters to storm the Capitol that led to the deadly January 6 riot -- without his testimony. They plan to argue his refusal to testify underscores his guilt. And there is no appetite for a potential court showdown if Trump were to refuse to comply with a Senate subpoena for his testimony -- while many Senate Democrats are eager to keep the trial short in order to move onto other business quickly.

All of which, Democratic sources say, means it's unlikely that the managers will pursue a subpoena for the former President.

""His immediate refusal to testify speaks volumes and plainly establishes an adverse inference supporting his guilt,"" Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager , said Thursday night, while making no mention of issuing a subpoena to compel his testimony.

No final decisions have been made yet on how hard to pursue Trump's testimony or issue a subpoena, Democratic sources say. Moreover, Democrats are still undecided about calling witnesses to testify, but there is a growing expectation that they won't seek testimony from anyone in large part because the senators all experienced themselves what happened that day and video evidence will be able to tell the story vividly.

"Biden administration to use Defense Production Act for Pfizer supplies, at-home tests and masks","(CNN) The Biden administration is making use of the Defense Production Act in three key areas, the top official tasked with supplies announced Friday, including equipment and supplies for Pfizer vaccine production, an increase in at-home or point of care testing, and personal protective equipment, particularly gloves, for front-line workers.

After President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing US agencies to use the law, the administration has identified shortfalls in 12 critical categories of supplies, the White House's supply coordinator Tim Manning said at Friday's briefing.

The law, Manning said, will help address what he described as a critical shortage of rubber gloves, something that is a ""grave need.""

""There's a grave need for masks, shields, and gloves, and we currently aren't producing these at the rate we need in order to keep up with demand. We're already working to increase the availability of N95 masks to frontline workers but another critical area of concern we hear over and over is surgical gloves. Right now we just don't have enough gloves,"" Manning said.

""We're nearly 100% reliant on overseas manufacturers to export to us, our country's surgical gloves that protect health care workers, and that's unacceptable and we're using all of our authorities to fix it,"" Manning said.

"Female Nazi concentration camp secretary charged with complicity in 10,000 murders in Germany","Berlin (CNN) A former secretary from the Stutthof Nazi concentration camp has been charged with complicity in the murders of 10,000 people, German prosecutors said Friday, in what is a rare case involving an alleged female concentration camp staff member.

Prosecutors in Itzehoe did not name the woman but said in a statement that they charged her with ""aiding and abetting murder in more than 10,000 cases,"" as well as complicity in attempted murder.

The woman, who was a minor at the time of the alleged crimes, ""is accused of having assisted those responsible at the camp in the systematic killing of Jewish prisoners, Polish partisans and Soviet Russian prisoners of war in her function as a stenographer and secretary to the camp commander,"" between June 1943 and April 1945, the prosecutors said in a statement.

She will face a juvenile court because she was under 18 when she served in Stutthof.

Friday's vote on the bill in the House of Delegates was 57-41, with three Republicans joining the Democratic majority in support of the measure.

Virginia's Democratic-led Senate passed their version of the bill on Wednesday on a party-line vote, and it was referred to a House committee Friday.

The two bills will need to be approved by the other chamber, and Virginia House Democrats are ""confident that both bills will be passed by both chambers, as they are identical,"" the majority's press secretary Kate Sarna told CNN.

But Friday's passage in the House effectively guarantees the legislation will reach the governor's desk.

Virginia's Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam supports abolishing the death penalty, and after the Senate's vote on Wednesday, said he looks forward to signing the bill.

Virginia has executed more than 1,300 people -- more than any other state since the Jamestown colony's first recorded execution in 1608 for espionage, according to the Death Penalty Information Center

If the bill is signed into law, Virginia would be the first southern state to repeal the death penalty since the US Supreme Court reinstated the punishment in 1976.

Debate among the Virginia lawmakers this week over the bill has been emotionally charged.

Ahead of the final vote Friday, GOP state Del. Jason Miyares, who voted against the bill, argued that the death penalty is not about revenge, but about justice for the victims.

During Thursday's debate on the bill, Miyares, a former criminal prosecutor, held up pictures of murder victims in Virginia, describing the horrible and violent ending to their lives, and arguing that ""victims have been completely left out in this debate over the death penalty.""

The House bill's sponsor, Del. Mike Mullin, and other Democrats argued that the death penalty should be abolished because it ""is immoral, racially biased, ineffective, and costly.""

""What keeps me up at night is that we run the risk of executing an innocent person,"" the Democratic lawmaker said in a statement.

Democratic Del. Mark Levine got choked up on Friday as he shared emotional testimony of how his sister Janet was murdered by her husband.

Levine said that the House bill is not about him, or the victims, but ""about the fact that the state may end up killing innocent people.""

""Killing someone else doesn't bring Janet back to me,"" Levine said, adding that wrongfully executing an innocent person would be ""evil.""

The legislation would eliminate capital punishment sentencing effective July. It would also commute existing death sentences to life imprisonment without parole.

Some Senate Republicans had objected to that chamber's bill because it did not include a mandatory minimum life sentence for aggravated murder without the possibility of parole. There were two inmates on death row in Virginia as of December 2020, according to Virginia's Department of Corrections.

Marijuana legalization

The House also voted Friday to legalize recreational marijuana in Virginia by a vote of 55-42, with two abstaining, and the Senate later Friday passed its own measure by 23-15.

If the legislation is signed by Northam, Virginia would become the first Southern state to legalize recreational use.

The bills would create the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority and establish a regulatory structure for the cultivation, manufacture, wholesale and retail sale of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products, to be administered by the authority.

The measures would also provide a process to automatically expunge certain marijuana-related convictions.

According to their summaries, the bills have staggered effective dates and would allow retail marijuana sales to start on January 1, 2024, while certain provisions do not become effective unless reenacted by the 2022 session of the General Assembly.

Northam has pushed for marijuana to be legalized this session and signed legislation last year that decriminalized marijuana possession

CNN has reached out to his office requesting comment on Friday's votes.

Employees working from home are putting in longer hours than before the pandemic,"London (CNN Business) Enjoying more free time while working from home? Maybe not. New research conducted during the pandemic shows that home-working employees in the United Kingdom, Austria, Canada and the United States are putting in more hours than before.

Home working has led to a 2.5-hour increase in the average working day in those countries, said NordVPN Teams, a New York-based company that provides virtual private networks (VPNs) to businesses.

The United Kingdom and the Netherlands stand out, with employees ""working until 8pm, regularly logging off later than usual to wrap up an extended working day,"" it added.

However, employees in Denmark, Belgium and Spain initially recorded a spike in working hours but have since returned to their pre-pandemic timetable, NordVPN Teams said in a statement.

NordVPN Teams, which works with more than 10,000 companies, looked at the amount of data being sent via servers to calculate employees' working hours.

CDC director says guidance on reopening schools to be released in the coming week,"(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will release guidance on school reopenings in the coming week, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Friday, amid rising tensions about how best to send students and teachers back into the classroom.

""Among the things that we need to do to make sure that schools are safe is to make sure that the community spread of the disease is down,"" Walensky said during a White House briefing.

She continued: ""We are actively working on the guidance, the official guidance, which will be released in the week ahead.""

The guidance will come amid a national debate about when and how to reopen schools safely, as fear of spreading the coronavirus has closed them and forced classes online amid the pandemic.

President Joe Biden has said he will work to reopen most K-12 schools within his first 100 days in office but has stressed he will rely on health and medical experts to dictate the national guidance in order to reopen safely.

"TSA: Mask violators face $250 fine, up to $1,500 for repeat offenders","(CNN) — Violators of the federal transportation face mask requirement face a $250 fine that increases for subsequent violations, the Transportation Security Administration said Friday.

The fine can rise up to $1,500 for repeated violations.

""Based on substantial aggravating or mitigating factors, TSA may seek a sanction amount that falls outside these ranges,"" the agency said.

The penalties may be in addition to those imposed by operators.

US airlines have taken the initiative to ban passengers who do not follow the rules. Delta Air Lines said in a company memo on February 1 that it has banned about 950 people for violating its mask rule.

"AstraZeneca vaccine effective against UK variant, University of Oxford statement says","An NHS member prepares a dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine at Stithians Showground near Truro, England, on January 26. Hugh Hastings/Getty Images

The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine “has similar efficacy against the B.1.1.7 ‘Kent’ coronavirus strain currently circulating in the UK to previously circulating variants,” a statement from University of Oxford published Friday read.

The university said a preprint of ongoing work to assess effectiveness of its coronavirus vaccine also described recent analysis “showing that the vaccination results in a reduction in the duration of shedding and viral load, which may translate into a reduced transmission of the disease.”

Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and Immunity and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: “Data from our trials of the ChAdOx1 vaccine in the United Kingdom indicate that the vaccine not only protects against the original pandemic virus, but also protects against the novel variant, B.1.1.7, which caused the surge in disease from the end of 2020 across the UK.”

Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said the university was working with AstraZeneca to “optimise the pipeline required for a strain change should one become necessary.”

“This is the same issue that is faced by all of the vaccine developers, and we will continue to monitor the emergence of new variants that arise in readiness for a future strain change,” she added."
Japan's Kirin ditches Myanmar beer partner because of its ties to the military,"Hong Kong/Seoul (CNN Business) Japanese companies bet on Myanmar years ago as the Southeast Asian country emerged from decades of military rule. But this week's coup has already ended one of those deals.

Brewing giantsaid on Friday that it is ending a six-year-old joint venture with a holding company in Myanmar that is linked to the country's military. The army this week seized power in a coup, detaining the country's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and numerous other top government figures.

Kirin is ""deeply concerned by the recent actions of the military in Myanmar,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it had ""no option but to terminate"" the partnership.

Suu Kyi's landslide election victory in 2015 followed decades of isolation and military authoritarianism. That same year, Kirin spent $560 million to buy a majority stake in Myanmar Brewery, the country's top beer company.

Its local business partner and co-owner is Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Company Limited, a firm which the UN Human Rights Council and others have pointed out is owned and operated by the Tatmadaw , the country's powerful military.

""We decided to invest in Myanmar in 2015, believing that, through our business, we could contribute positively to the people and the economy of the country as it entered an important period of democratization,"" Kirin said Friday.

Nissan NSANF Daiwa Securities DSEEY Daiwa told CNN Business that almost all of the company's 10 staff members returned to Japan because of the coronavirus pandemic. It added that its business ventures in Myanmar are operating ""as usual."" Japanese companies have been investing heavily in Myanmar for more than a decade. opened a production facility there, while the Japanese investment bankand the Tokyo Stock Exchange were tapped to help build Myanmar's first stock exchange.Daiwa told CNN Business that almost all of the company's 10 staff members returned to Japan because of the coronavirus pandemic. It added that its business ventures in Myanmar are operating ""as usual.""

Myanmar isn't a major beer market for Kirin. Myanmar Brewery contributed just 1.8% of Kirin's revenue through the first nine months of 2020, according to its most recent earnings report

But it was a fast growing one. Beer consumption in Myanmar rose by 16% in 2019.

Pressure on Kirin to drop its business ties in Myanmar had been growing even before this week's coup. A military crackdown against the ethnic Rohingya Muslim population in the country, which bore ""the hallmarks of genocide"" according to the United Nations, has been widely condemned.

Suu Kyi's handling of that crisis has also been criticized. (Myanmar has denied the charges and has long claimed to have been targeting terrorists.)

A few years ago, Amnesty International raised concerns about whether donations made by Myanmar Brewery were used to benefit the country's military. And in 2019, a United Nations independent fact-finding mission released a report claiming that Myanmar's military had been using its business ties to support its ""brutal operation against ethnic groups.""

Kirin has since been investigating its operations in the country, and last November suspended dividend payments to the Myanmar holding company."

Andrew Yang: How to pull American cities through the pandemic,"Andrew Yang is a Democratic candidate for mayor of New York. The opinion expressed in this commentary are his own.

A city can't consider itself prosperous when its poorest residents are unable to even afford the basics of housing, food and childcare. And no one should consider the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic a success until the gains in employment, income and social mobility are evenly distributed.

By far, communities of color have suffered the most during this ongoing pandemic. Black workers are overrepresented in jobs that have been deemed essential during this crisis, yet they are among the hardest hit . The loss of life and the loss of jobs have completely upended neighborhoods that were already struggling to make ends meet, especially in expensive cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Congress has offered some direct cash relief in the form of one-time payments and supplemental unemployment benefits during this crisis. They now seem poised to give more thanks to President Joe Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While this is a good start, we need cash relief on a consistent basis for far more Americans.

That's why, in my bid to become New York's next mayor, implementing the largest basic income program in the country and establishing a public bank -- the People's Bank -- are among my top policy priorities. We need policies that will lead to a fair and robust recovery.

Our initial basic income proposal is a $1 billion initiative that would give up to $5,000 annually, paid out every month, to the 500,000 poorest New Yorkers. As the city's tax base recovers and as we secure private philanthropic commitments, those payouts will grow. This investment will help thousands of New Yorkers avoid situations that cost the city dearly in both human and economic terms.

Fortunately, several other municipalities have already begun trial programs to understand the benefits of providing a basic income to its residents. For instance, Stockton, California recently completed a program that provided 125 residents with $500 a month for two years while another program of participating Black mothers in Jackson, Mississippi received $1,000 a month for one year. A report of the latter found that among the successes, the number of mothers that completed their GED jumped from 63% to 85%.

Cash relief has taken off as a core way of combating poverty because the idea is as simple as it is effective. Giving people money leads to better outcomes for individuals and their families. According to the Stanford Basic Income Lab, which looked at different basic universal income programs globally, ""Findings are generally positive that UBI-type programs alleviate poverty and improve health and education outcomes."" It also found that the ""effects on labor market participation are minimal,"" meaning people continued to work and not rely solely on the cash payments.

Of course, a basic income program isn't sufficient on its own. As mayor, I also plan to establish a People's Bank in New York City that will help small businesses access affordable loans and New Yorkers access bank accounts.

The bank would initially launch with a $100 million loan and will partner with local Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which focus on loans to low-income communities. I made a pledge to help 15,000 small businesses open in New York City, and we won't achieve that unless we create an investment system that isn't purely driven by profit and supports businesses that make New York such a dynamic economy.

The bank will also help New Yorkers open accounts throughout the city.

Right now, over 11% of households in New York have no bank account . The lack of bank accounts means the most vulnerable New Yorkers -- including undocumented immigrants and individuals with experience in the criminal justice system -- are forced to turn to check cashing and other alternative financial services, like payday lending, which often charge high interest rates and have unfair terms of repayment, that leave them in a growing and unending cycle of debt. Households that rely on such services can pay over $600 a year just to cash checks . That's not a sustainable foundation for a broad-based recovery.

Still, a public bank shouldn't be the only place vulnerable New Yorkers can gain access to a legitimate bank account or financial services. That's why US Representative Ritchie Torres of the Bronx and I recently called for financial institutions to stop denying immigrants and other vulnerable populations the opportunity to sign up for their offerings.

Taken together, I believe a basic income program and a public bank are essential ingredients for New York and other cities to recover quickly and equitably.

But cities cannot be solely responsible for pursuing an anti-poverty agenda. During a time of severe budget restraints, we need the federal government to be a partner as well.

Most importantly, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris must continue pursuing a rapid acceleration of vaccine distribution so that New York and other cities can ramp up inoculations, especially in communities of color. Any recovery hinges on near-universal inoculations.

And of course, we also need Congress to pass President Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to help struggling Americans, businesses and state and municipal budgets.

I have no doubt New York and other cities will continue to be the bedrock of America's economy. That means the mayors of our country's urban areas have to set the tone for what our economic priorities will be. Cash relief and establishing a public bank are a great place to start."
Amanda Gorman's fellow laureates are tuning in for Super Bowl LV -- but for poetry over pigskin,"For three young scribes, the star of Super Bowl Sunday won't be Patrick Mahomes or Tom Brady , no matter how many touchdowns they throw. No, they'll be tuning in for Amanda Gorman

The 22-year-old Los Angeles poet brought a moment of peace to a beleaguered nation when she delivered her stirring poem, ""The Hill We Climb,"" at President Joe Biden's inauguration two weeks after the Capitol riots . She's now been tapped to perform on perhaps an even bigger stage Sunday.

Meera Dasgupta, Pat Frazier and Kara Jackson aren't football fans, but they'll be tuning in. As Gorman's successors in the National Youth Poet Laureate Program , they're keenly interested in seeing their peer serenade the nation again. For these activists and lyricists, the moment couldn't be bigger.

""I think it's doing the work of forcing people to acknowledge poetry as a valid source of commentary and reflection and scrutiny. ... I'm hoping it forces people to invest and acknowledge Amanda as integral to spaces they didn't think poetry was a part of,"" Jackson told CNN. ""Maybe poetry is relevant everywhere, and it's relevant during a football game.""

Added Frazier, ""I'll be super happy that someone who looks like me is up there on that stage. ... The spirit of this moment is going to empower so many young people throughout the world.""

Gorman's performance has cast poetry into a long-desired spotlight, said Shanelle Gabriel, interim executive director of Urban Word NYC , which administers the National Youth Poet Laureate Program. Urban Word is capitalizing by connecting more young people to poetry slams, open mics, writing workshops and other programs, she said.

""Amanda Gorman is such a powerhouse,"" Gabriel said. ""Our young people deserve the grandest platforms for their perspective and stories. We hope that this is an awakening for others, especially those in positions of power, to consider supporting organizations that cultivate and champion youth voices.""

'My words had given her a voice'

Meera is the reigning national youth poet laureate, and at 16, was the program's youngest honoree. She's long enjoyed writing but only recently turned her talents to poetry.

In elementary school, she would turn in 50-page papers with ""the margins completely darkened,"" she recalled. Teachers would tell her she didn't need to add annotations, ""but it was something that I liked to do."" Reading was another favorite pastime.

""It was not only an escape from reality, but it allowed for a multitude of realities to pour into my hands,"" Meera, now 17, said.

Her poetry education as a youngster consisted of Shakespeare's sonnets and the like. She didn't understand the medium's power, she said, before discovering slam poetry and spoken word, and it wasn't until the Queens, New York, native joined her Stuyvesant High School speech team as a sophomore that she realized she could write her own poems.

She attended a workshop in Jackson Heights for Climate Speaks , a spoken word program for young authors, and delivered her poem, ""Happily Ever After, the End,"" a confluence of childhood memories and her end of innocence regarding climate change.

Her debut effort earned her a finalist spot, and following her performance at Harlem's Apollo Theater, an audience member helped her realize the potency of her art

...Once upon a time/The smell of popcorn wafting through the air/The movie Rio began to play/Where mystical, blue, feathered birds spoke/The impossible was possible/And the worst problem in the world/Was running out of M&Ms/Little did I know that Blue was dead/His species wiped out/Life losing to greed/The magic wore off/The veil lifted/Wildfires crackling/Smoke darkening/Children asphyxiated by a cloud of debris/No more movies, only cable news... Excerpt from 'Happily Ever After, the End,' by Meera Dasgupta

""My words had given her a voice; it was something that she had always wanted to talk about and express her viewpoint on,"" Meera recalled. ""I kind of saw myself in her eyes, too. Emotions can move people in ways that facts cannot.""

Meera didn't choose poetry; it chose her, the South Asian American teen said, giggling infectiously at how cheesy it sounds -- but pointing out it wasn't until she became a wordsmith she learned she was named after Mirabai, the 16th-century Hindu mystic poet.

Gorman is a role model for Meera, she said. When her English teachers (yes, she has two) let their classes watch the inauguration and Gorman's recital , it confirmed something Meera already knew: Gorman was not there for herself.

""As a young person, she's continued to find ways to make sure that not only her voice is heard. She's uplifted so many communities with her. It's an entire neighborhood she has brought up with her,"" she said.

Scrutiny and 'a forging of identity'

Jackson and Frazier are best friends and both live in the Chicago area. They met five years ago during a poetry apprenticeship, Louder Than a Bomb Squad , which borrows its name from the 1988 Public Enemy song. When Jackson was named the 2019 national youth poet laureate, it was Frazier, the previous year's winner, who bestowed her with the honor.

""Both of us are pretty hyper-aware a lot of our life paths are intertwined,"" Jackson, 21, said.

While you can hear something akin to Public Enemy rhymesmith Chuck D's fiery cadence in their verses, Jackson's and Frazier's styles are quite different.

Frazier's late grandmother wrote poetry. Frazier started out as a songwriter before transitioning to poetry. Fittingly, Frazier grew up in Ida B. Wells Homes, named for the journalist and civil rights leader, before their demolition a decade ago. As a youngster, Frazier was timid and ""wrote letters to tell people things I was not confident enough to tell them and kept (the letters) to myself.""

""Everyone was on the computer all day, and my generation was not invited to pay attention very much,"" the Columbia College cinema directing major said. ""Writing was the first space where I was invited to pay attention. ... Something in me wanted to feel gratitude for the things around me, and writing was a space for me to do that unapologetically.""

Frazier, who is nonbinary and uses the pronouns they and them, received their mom's permission to ride the bus in seventh grade and took the opportunity to explore the Chi. You can hear their familiarity and love for their hometown in the beat-style verses of ""I Am Windy City."" Frazier told an audience at the Library of Congress they wrote the ode ""because people throw dirt on Chicago so often that I feel we might end up under it.""

... Chiraq turned churches into resale gun stores/Chiraq a trap song sirenade sung into the wrong ear/Chiraq city of lost/Boys under the hood/Chiraq could never/Take my face value of royal flush into the Chicago River/My leaning Sears Tower of pizza/My Heineken and soul food gout feet tap dancing barefoot with my hot-headed friends/My confetti fleshed comrades/Come, break bread with me Excerpt from 'I am Windy City,' by Patricia Frazier

Asked about their pride in Chicago, Frazier stopped the interviewer. Pride is an interesting word, they said.

""What I recall about the neighborhood, I recall having so much shame of where I was from -- the fact that I lived in a project. I was unable to appreciate what it was while I was there,"" the 22-year-old told CNN. ""A lot of me writing about Chicago is me desperate to remember it ... writing about the places I came from, desperate to not lose those places and desperate to make them permanent.""

Jackson, too, has been writing most of her life, both songs and poems, though her middle school sonnets were ""emo and weird,"" she said, and she didn't take the craft seriously until joining her high school's spoken word club.

She lives in Oak Park, just outside Chicago, and doesn't feel she speaks for the city like Frazier can. Her work centers on her lineage -- generational and collective trauma, the women in her family, her father's Southern upbringing.

""It's more a duty I feel to speak to my lineage as someone who is testifying and creating these poems as testament to my people and how they lived,"" she said. Chicago and the South are ""reduced to certain things and certain stereotypes. I feel it's my duty to rectify those reductions and to tell a full story of the South that's missed and obscured by these generalizations and lack of attention and love.""

There is too much room for death in this poem. Somewhere, there's a body writing itself into the ground. Sometimes it's not about the coffin wood. It's all about the blood in this poem. Here the dead live where the page breaks. Grandma unbuckles her shoes and leaves them under this poem. In this poem, death comes with a glass of water. We find Auntie here. She was never lost, but looking for a poem to die in... Excerpt from 'A Casket is a Sad Excuse for a Poem,' by Kara Jackson

Poetry's relevance lies in its accessibility, in ""the quality of light"" with which it allows us to scrutinize our lives, the Smith College sophomore said, paraphrasing Audre Lord's 1985 essay, ""Poetry Is Not a Luxury.""

""One of the oldest practices of scrutiny we have is poetry. It's unlike all other art forms. It's so innate in terms of articulating ourselves,"" she said. ""It lends itself to any class. ... You can write a poem down on a napkin. You can write a poem on the notes in your phone. You can write a poem down anywhere. I think that's why it continues to be a relevant form of scrutiny.""

Meera calls poetry ""a forging of identity"" and says while it's often considered performative, it can be a ""visceral personal experience on vulnerability, too."" The high school senior loves to combine education and experience, as she did when she tapped the lessons of her college-level gender studies class in writing, ""explaining brown girl feminism to a white man on the e train.""

""It allowed me to express an emotion that I felt and wasn't able to consolidate immediately,"" she said. ""You can really write a poem about anything. You look up and see a clock and can talk about time and the future. I see a chair and you can talk about a seat at the table. If you choose to step into new perspectives, you'll discover so much.""

'Young poets are not here to play'

Watching Gorman on Inauguration Day, Frazier couldn't stop processing what had happened during the Capitol riot , ""and then this young Black woman does a poem in proximity to where just a few weeks earlier there was a White supremacist coup. I kept remembering the bravery and ferocity,"" they said.

Frazier considers Gorman a sort of mentor, and the inauguration poem reminded them, ""OK, you have something to say, and it deserves to be heard no matter who is outside the door threatening to kick it down.""

Pat Frazier says she's still pondering ""what does it look like to take the reins of this opportunity that Amanda has given to all of us ... but still be firm in what I believe about my home and how I believe my people who I love so much will be protected."" Credit: Hannah Steinkopf-Frank/RedEye/Chicago Tribune/TNS/Alamy Live News

Jackson, too, was inspired. There ""wasn't a better person for that gig,"" she said, especially considering Gorman would like to be inaugurated as President of the United States herself one day.

""I know that that's super possible,"" Jackson said. ""It's always great to see a Black woman actualizing her dreams. I'm happy for Amanda, happy for the state of poetry. I'm also meditating on the fact poetry is so integral to America and our story.""

Even if they won't be decked out in Chiefs or Bucs gear and laying seanotes on the over-under, the writers are stoked to tune in for the Super Bowl -- Frazier from Chicago's Roseland neighborhood, Jackson from Oak Park and Meera from her newish home in Oswego, New York.

They're excited not just because Gorman represents what every poet can build but also what they can tear down.

Frazier sees the poetry world as dominated by ageism, which Gorman threatens to obliterate, while Meera sees the Super Bowl as a social construct representing ""so many standards of identity"" in America's infrastructure, from the machismo of the game itself to the sex symbols taking the field as cheerleaders and performers.

Watching Gorman knock down barriers ""leaves me hopeful the youth are becoming the future, and every day is an aspect of the future,"" the 17-year-old said.

""The contrast of it all is going to be pretty impactful because we've never seen a Super Bowl quite like that,"" Kara Jackson says of Amanda Gorman's upcoming performance. Credit: courtesy Mercedes Zapata

""I'm interested to see those forces collide and intersect,"" Jackson said. ""I see it as interrupting a certain singularity and notion we have about that space. ... It will force us to realize the autonomy of Black women.""

As much as Frazier admires Gorman, they wouldn't necessarily want to follow her same path -- for one, their politics vary considerably -- but they're eager to see how Gorman's message is received around the world.

""Amanda performing at the Super Bowl in front of the whole wide world,"" they said, ""it really makes a statement that young poets are not here to play . We are not here to pretend. We are not here to be under the shadow and wait.

""There is no time for anymore waiting. We have things to say, and we have to say them now."""
Cancer doctors consider Covid-19 vaccines for patients,"It's a question that has been on the minds of researchers and oncologists long before the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine rollouts began. Although there is a consensus that the vaccines are safe for most cancer patients, according to the American Cancer Society and others in the medical community, research into whether they will be effective for cancer patients is still a data-free zone.

The American Cancer Society recommends that cancer patients talk to their doctors before getting any type of vaccine because all patients and their courses of treatment are different.

There are several factors that may require a cancer patient to delay vaccination, including recent stem cell transplants or other recent use of therapy agents known to reduce vaccine efficacy, according to Dr. Laura Makaroff, the American Cancer Society's Senior Vice President for Prevention and Early Detection.

""As far as safety of the vaccine, every situation for every patient with cancer is a little different. And there's a spectrum of where any one patient might be in their cancer journey,"" Makaroff told CNN. ""The Covid-19 vaccine is definitely safe for people with cancer but it's important that patients have a conversation with their healthcare provider and their cancer care team to determine when is the right time to have the vaccine.""

""All the guidance that we're seeing -- the American Cancer society and other leading oncology groups -- is that Covid-19 immunization is recommended for patients in active therapy, but we really understand that there are limited safety and efficacy data on these patients,"" Makaroff said.

Even with limited data, many cancer experts, medical groups, and doctors are making a big push for vaccinating most cancer patients -- especially those cancer patients most at risk during the pandemic

""The potential benefits far outweigh the risks,"" said Dr. Brian Koffman, chief medical officer for CLL Society , a group that represents patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the most common adult form of leukemia in the western world.

""Despite the lack of safety data specifically in patients with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), SARS-Cov-2 vaccination is anticipated to be safe.""

Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who develop symptomatic Covid-19 have an 89% risk of hospitalization, Koffman told CNN, based on a study published in the journal Nature

CLL is characterized by a weakened immune system. The immunocompromization is so severe that CLL patients are advised to avoid live vaccines such as the ones for measles or yellow fever.

And a weakened immune system also means these cancer patients have an increased risk of death due to Covid-19, according to Dr. Chaitra Ujjani, a physician at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and oncology professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine. The Nature study , conducted the by European Research Initiative on CLL, found that the mortality rate for CLL patients with symptomatic coronavirus was 31%.

""The thing that people don't quite realize is that the impaired immune system in CLL patients -- due to the disease or some of the treatments for the disease -- can actually impact your response to vaccination,"" Ujjani told CNN.

""We recommend the Covid-19 vaccines for our patients ... but we're not really sure how effective it's going to be,"" she added. ""Patients with blood cancers are typically excluded from the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of the vaccine.""

The American Cancer Society suggests that patients talk to their doctors before getting any type of vaccine.

Cancer-specific vaccine trials underway

To remedy the lack of data, Ujjani is launching a research study involving 500 CLL patients across the country -- all of whom are already slated to receive the vaccine from their doctor or pharmacist -- to determine what kind of immune response they will have to the commercially available vaccines.

The study, which is a collaboration between more than 10 medical institutions, will be the first of its kind and may bring more clarity for cancer patients.

The Seattle Cancer Care Alliance is conducting similar trials for other cancer types, including certain immune system and blood cancers, Ujjani said.

Advocacy groups for other more prevalent types of cancer are also encouraging cancer patients to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The Lung Cancer Action Network recently asked the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to give lung cancer patients expedited access to the vaccines.

""Because COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory condition, this disease presents a unique challenge to lung cancer patients , who are at extremely high risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19,"" said the group in a letter.

More research urgently needed

The scientific community agrees that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in cancer patients -- and many doctors are working around the clock to get more trials off the ground.

""We need these data so that we can better inform patients and better prioritize the allocation of the vaccines. If these vulnerable patients form an adequate immune response, we should certainly vaccinate them as early as possible,"" Dr. Elad Sharon, senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute, told CNN via email.

""But, if research efforts show that these patients fail to form a protective response to these vaccines, then what we will need to do will be to vaccinate everyone around these patients first, so that our medically vulnerable patients are most protected by the people living with them and caring for them.""

Ujjani added, ""We're all working really hard to answer this question, but it's hard because we've been working kind of against the clock as the vaccines just became available.""

""A lot of our patients have suffered in isolation and fear, and they're not sure they're going to get back to a normal life,"" Ujjani told CNN. ""So every oncologist is interested to see how their patients will respond to the vaccine."""
Biden White House wants to use the Super Bowl to advance message on Covid and vaccines,"(CNN) President Joe Biden's urgent goal of tackling the Covid-19 pandemic depends heavily on persuading Americans to get the vaccine as quickly as possible and educating the public about the virus -- and his top aides have been eyeing this weekend's Super Bowl as an opportunity to score some points.

The President and first lady Jill Biden have taped a video message thanking healthcare workers that will be shown before the game, according to a source familiar with the plans. An administration official told CNN that the White House also hoped to use this Sunday's event to combat vaccine hesitancy and speak to the African American, Latino and white, rural ""non-mask wearing"" communities in particular. The Super Bowl presents ""an interesting opportunity to reach all three of those audiences,"" the official said.

The White House has been in touch with the NFL and other brands involved in the Super Bowl on ways to integrate pro-mask and pro-vaccine messaging in the highly watched event, one White House official said. They declined to elaborate further on the extent of the White House's collaboration with the league or specific companies.

The Super Bowl weekend messaging strategy is a part of a wide-reaching national campaign the Biden administration is trying to develop to urge responsible behavior and encourage Americans to receive the Covid vaccine when it is their turn. It has consulted with behavioral economists and messaging strategists, an administration official said, and is continually monitoring polls around the issue. Biden's top aides have also been brainstorming individuals trusted by the public -- including some celebrities -- who might be able to help spread their message in the future.

This comes as Biden's overwhelming concern in recent days when being briefed by his top health advisers has centered around questions about both the speed and reach of the Covid vaccines, the official said.

""Tell it to me straight. How fast can we go? How fast can we get people?"" is how the official described some of the most urgent questions the President asks his top Covid advisers. ""How can we get it to everybody -- not just the easy people?""

Notably, Biden struck an optimistic tone in public last week when he said he was hopeful that the United States could be administering 1.5 million vaccine shots per day in a matter of weeks. His previously stated goal was to get 1 million shots into arms per day for the first 100 days of his presidency. Biden also said that anyone who wants a vaccine would be able to get one by this spring -- a more ambitious timeline than some of his top health officials had previously projected.

At the time, his aides insisted that the White House's official goal remained administering 1 million shots per day, and that Biden was simply expressing his hope that there would be ""greater availability"" of vaccines by springtime. An administration official told CNN that Biden's Covid team had not planned on the President publicly sharing those specific aspirations.

""He expects it to go up,"" the official said about the number of vaccinations administered daily. ""He's pushing and hoping.""

As of Thursday, more than 35 million doses of the Covid vaccine had been administered, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with some 6.9 million people having received two doses of the vaccine.

In a public briefing on Wednesday, CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky urged Americans to watch Sunday's game responsibly.

""Remember -- whichever team you're rooting for and whichever commercial is your favorite, please watch the Super Bowl safely, gathering only virtually or with the people you live with,"" Walensky said.

The NFL, for its part, has consulted with public health officials in preparation for the weekend, and announced a set of protocols including mandatory mask-wearing and social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid at this weekend's game. It has also invited around 7,500 vaccinated health care workers to the game to honor their ongoing work during the pandemic. According to the NFL, some 14,500 people will be in attendance through general admission, and another 2,700 fans in stadium suites.

""We hope in a small way that this initiative will inspire our country and recognize these true American heroes,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said

Sources told ESPN that coaches and players for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs will be tested twice a day before the Sunday game.

Goodell also wrote to Biden in a letter Thursday that every NFL team would make its stadium available for mass vaccination of the public. The Biden administration has said developing such vaccination sites will be a major part of its push to ramp up the pace of Covid vaccinations.

Joe Lockhart, a veteran of the Clinton administration who also served as chief spokesman for the National Football League, said the Super Bowl was a ""singular event"" in American culture that provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity to capture an audience.

""There's nothing else like it. There's no other place to sell your cars or educate the public,"" Lockhart said. ""So, I think it's an enormous opportunity for the public health community to get their message out including the White House.""

The White House has long made clear that combating vaccine hesitancy by addressing concerns among Americans about whether the Covid vaccines are safe and effective is a top priority in fighting the pandemic.

That effort has become all the more urgent with variants of the virus first detected in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa popping up across the United States. Biden's top health officials have stressed in recent days that the best way to stop the spread of the new variants is to vaccinate the American public as quickly as possible.

Another upcoming challenge for the Biden administration is the expected approval of a third vaccine for use in the United States from Johnson & Johnson. Trials have shown that that the single-dose vaccine has a lower level of efficacy than the two already being administered in the US -- made by Moderna and Pfizer -- and the administration is trying to temper potential skepticism about whether the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is worth taking.

""You need to get vaccinated when it becomes available as quickly and as expeditiously as possible,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to Biden and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said this week. ""You stop their replication by vaccinating widely... When the vaccine becomes available to you, please get vaccinated.""

The administration will also need to make sure that there is eventually enough vaccine supply to allow them to significantly ramp up the pace of getting shots into arms -- specifically, to meet the goal of fully vaccinating nearly the entire US population by the end of summer or early fall. Biden announced last week the purchase of 200 million more vaccine doses.

Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris received their Covid vaccines in recent weeks in front of cameras in an effort to help fight vaccine hesitancy.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a recent press briefing that many celebrities have offered their help in publicly speaking out about the safety of the Covid vaccines.

""Great. We welcome that,"" Psaki said. ""But what's interesting in the data is that local doctors and local officials -- you know, people from the community -- are people who are most often most trusted, and so we're really trying to empower and be able to fund local communities to be able to be the spokespeople to build that trust."""

"US economy adds 49,000 jobs in January — a grim sign for the jobs recovery","New York (CNN Business) America's jobs recovery has lost steam: Even though 49,000 jobs were added in January, the nation is still down nearly 10 million jobs since before the pandemic.

Friday's January jobs report also showed that the unemployment rate fell to 6.3%, beating economists' expectations, marking the first decrease in two months

The return of some jobs and a lower unemployment rate are definitely good news. But the US labor market needs great news to get out of this crisis

""It may look good, but it ain't,"" wrote Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, adding that the details of the report were a lot less flattering than the headline numbers.

While the unemployment rate decreased, the labor force participation rate inched down ever so slightly, too, leaving a bad aftertaste following the good news.

""I'd like the unemployment rate go down while the labor force is growing,"" said Boston College economics professor Robert Murphy.

Friday's report showed the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the data for November — when fewer jobs than thought were added, and December — when more jobs than initially reported were lost. December marked the first monthly loss of jobs since April, when the economy ground to a halt.

Since February last year, the economy is still down 9.9 million jobs.

Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the number of employed workers in the United States won't return to its pre-pandemic level until 2024.

The January improvements in the labor market weren't spread evenly across sectors. The leisure and hospitality sector, which is bearing the brunt of job losses in this crisis due to the face-to-face nature of its businesses, lost 61,000 jobs. Over the past two months, nearly 600,000 jobs in the industry were lost.

Retail, health care and transportation and warehousing also saw jobs disappear.

""I don't see it as a real strong report at all,"" Murphy said. ""That headline number is not very encouraging. On the private side there was minimal creation.""

Indeed, the private sector as a whole only added 6,000 jobs in January, while the rest of the increase came from jobs added in public education and government.

Trump's final report card

The January jobs report was based on data collected before President Donald Trump left office, making it the data point that closes the book on Trump's jobs record.

He is the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than he entered, largely because of pandemic-related job losses

But even his record for his first 37 months in office wasn't as strong as Trump often claimed. There were some 6,900 jobs added from January 2017 through February of last year. That's better than the first 37 months in office for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, but Obama entered office in the midst of the Great Recession and the economy slipped into another recession shortly after Bush took office. Trump took office during a period of what economists consider full employment.

Trump's pre-pandemic job gains trailed the gains during the first 37 months of Obama's second term, or his final 37 months in office. It also trailed gains during the first 37 months of President Bill Clinton's or Jimmy Carter's tenure."
Superspreader Sunday? How the National Football League is holding the Super Bowl during a pandemic,"A version of this story appeared in the February 5 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday

(CNN) In the year since the last Super Bowl, the coronavirus pandemic has claimed the lives of some 450,000 Americans.

Back in the spring, no one was sure what a National Football League season would look like, let alone whether its championship would go ahead. The virus shuffled schedules and forced players who tested positive to sit out, but not a single game was canceled. Now just one remains: Super Bowl LV.

It comes just as health officials are begging Americans to hunker down to help stop the spread of new strains of the coronavirus. And concerns are growing that Super Bowl parties this Sunday may lead to another spike in infections. In order to avoid a superspreader event, the way the game will be played, attended, presented and watched will look very different.

Around 25,000 fans -- including 7,500 healthcare workers -- will descend on the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida to watch the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers face off this weekend. But instead of foam fingers, they'll don free PPE upon arrival, including masks. ""We want our fans to be safe,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said. ""They need to be smart. They need to wear their PPE.""

Delivering a safe halftime show has also been a monumental task for British director Hamish Hamilton, who says the pandemic ""has put a very different set of parameters around the production."" This is, after all, an event which has previously involved an array of performers on stage with little social distancing.

But even with the most vigilant rules in place, the coronavirus still has the potential to derail the best-laid plans. The Chiefs had a particularly nerve-wracking Covid-19 scare this week, when it learned that a barber for the team had tested positive . Chiefs backup center Daniel Kilgore was in the chair getting a haircut when the results came in, ESPN reported. A number of Chiefs players, including quarterback Patrick Mahomes, were in line to get cuts on Sunday.

In the Covid-19 monitoring testing results for January 24-30 provided Tuesday by the NFL and the NFL Players Association, there were no new confirmed positive tests among players and one new confirmed positive among other personnel.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

A new single-dose vaccine could speed up vaccination efforts

Johnson & Johnson on Thursday applied to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization of its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine, setting it on course for potential distribution by March.

The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its independent advisory panel, which will vote on whether the vaccine should be authorized, on February 26, giving the group three weeks to review relevant data.

Last week, Johnson & Johnson released encouraging results from its late-stage clinical trial. The vaccine was shown to be 85% effective overall at preventing hospitalization and death in all three regions where it was tested -- the United States, Latin America and South Africa. But the results came with a significant caveat: Its efficacy against moderate and severe disease ranged from 72% in the US to 57% in South Africa, where a highly transmissible variant is driving infections.

If authorized, Johnson & Johnson would provide a third vaccine to the US market. The one-dose delivery, which doesn't require special handling, would also add flexibility and speed to vaccination efforts.

Vaccine nationalism is leaving a whole continent empty-handed

African nations are being left behind in the race for Covid-19 vaccines as richer countries stockpile doses, prioritizing their own populations and creating an unequal playing field. As of February 3, vaccine rollouts were underway in at least 68 countries and territories globally -- only four were in Africa.

Most African countries suffered fewer deaths from the first wave of the virus last year compared to other parts of the world. But case numbers are now surging, particularly in the southern region where a more virulent variant of the coronavirus is driving infections, Eoin McSweeney and Nyasha Shingono write

In a scramble to secure doses, South Africa, the worst-affected country on the continent, was forced to purchase the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute of India at nearly double the price paid by other wealthier countries -- $5.25 per dose, according to Reuters. The disparity in access and price has caused widespread anger amongst Africa's leaders, including South Africa's president and chair of the African Union, Cyril Ramaphosa, who has slammed Western nations for promoting ""vaccine nationalism"" that is marginalizing countries ""most in need.""

These frontline healthcare workers desperately want vaccines. They can't get them

Dr. Alfonso Velandia starts each hospital shift by counting his troops in the battle against the coronavirus. The 46-year-old emergency specialist manages intensive care units at the Cardiovascular Hospital in Soacha, a working-class suburb of Colombia's capital Bogotá. Since the pandemic began, he says he has seen the number of healthcare workers under his watch dwindle, even as the hospital expands its ICU to confront a relentless second wave of cases.

Velandia looks with frustration at statistics on vaccine distribution in Europe and North America, where hundreds of thousands of frontline healthcare workers have already been vaccinated against the deadly virus. ""I recently had a meeting, and my team was like 'We can't hold anymore'... we need the vaccine now!"" he told CNN.

But like many countries in the developing world, Colombia is yet to receive a single dose of a vaccine, Radina Gigova and Stefano Pozzebon report

ON OUR RADAR

An influential model is forecasting more than 630,000 Covid-19 deaths in the US by June 1.

President Joe Biden is hoping to resurrect a proposal from the Trump administration to mail face masks to every American.

Travelers to the United Kingdom from a so-called ""red list"" of countries will be required to quarantine for 10 days at a hotel from February 15.

Australia will increase incoming passenger caps, allowing more than 6,300 residents to return to the country per week.

A 30,000-member Facebook group is helping Hong Kong navigate a strict 21-day hotel quarantine.

TOP TIP

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released some tips on how to safely navigate Super Bowl Sunday celebrations. Their top piece of advice -- not surprisingly -- is to watch the game at home with the people you live with. If you insist on having a small watch party, the CDC says you should host it outdoors and make sure everyone has a mask. The guidance recommends limiting alcohol consumption because alcohol may make you less likely to follow Covid-19 safety measures.

""I think the biggest thing we learned -- which is not shocking to those of us in the medical profession -- universal masking works. It's the most effective strategy that we have."" -- NFL Chief Medical Officer Dr. Allen Sills"
Australian Open players and staff go into quarantine after a hotel worker tests positive for Covid-19,"(CNN) A single case of Covid-19 at a quarantine hotel in Melbourne has forced organizers of the Australian Open to quarantine 507 players, officials and support staff, just four days before the tennis championship is set to begin.

Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said late on Wednesday evening that a 26-year-old volunteer firefighter who had been working as a resident support officer as part of the tournament tested positive for the virus. Until then, the state had not seen local transmission of the virus in 28 days.

New restrictions have now been placed on the state's 6.7 million inhabitants. Masks are mandatory in indoor public places, and new limits are in place on the number of people who can gather in a household.

Andrews said the new rules were being put in place ""through an abundance of caution"" and because of the possibility that the case could have been caused by a new strain of the coronavirus -- although he said the genomic sequencing needed to determine whether that was the case hasn't finished yet.

The unnamed man last worked at the Grand Hyatt hotel on January 29 and tested negative for the virus at the end of his shift that day. However, he subsequently developed symptoms and tested positive on Wednesday.

"A week later, Robinhood removes trading restrictions on GameStop and AMC","New York (CNN Business) Robinhood lifted trading limits on GameStop, AMC and other Reddit favorites Friday, easing restrictions that engulfed the free trading app in controversy last week.

""There are currently no temporary limits to increasing your positions,"" Robinhood said in a blog post.

Robinhood has been gradually easing trading restrictions over the past week, increasing the number of shares that users can buy of Reddit stocks.

The startup blamed the temporary buying ban on surging market volatility, which drove its deposit requirements at clearinghouses dramatically higher. Robinhood repeatedly denied it was acting at the behest of hedge funds hurt by the GameStop rally. The trading app turned to investors to rapidly raise $3.4 billion, exceeding its total fundraising in the company's history to that point.

After crashing more than 83% so far this week, GameStop shares rallied 8% during premarket trading Friday. AMC rose 5%, regaining a slice of its sharp losses this week.

In a Twitter thread Thursday, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev acknowledged the challenges facing the fast-growing startup.

""Transforming an industry from the inside takes determination, hard work, investment, and a laser focus on the people we want to serve,"" Tenev said. ""Occasionally there are shortfalls along the way.""

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen summoned regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve and other agencies Thursday to discuss the Reddit-driven market volatility.

""The regulators believe the core infrastructure was resilient during high volatility and heavy trading volume and agree on the importance of the SEC releasing a timely study of the events,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement Thursday.

Treasury said the SEC and Commodities Futures Trading Commission are reviewing ""whether trading practices are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets."""
"It's still safest to avoid indoor dining, even if more states are allowing it","(CNN) For the Super Bowl this weekend, or if you are thinking ahead and planning for Valentine's Day, the health experts say with the pandemic still raging, and with variants popping up, the safest choice for a special meal is takeout.

Despite the high number of cases , more states and cities are letting restaurants open their doors to diners, albeit with limitations.

Last Friday Los Angeles said its restaurants could reopen for outdoor dining with restrictions and 50% capacity. Chicago reopened with rules that encourage physical distancing and masks. New York announced restaurants could reopen at 25% capacity just in time for Valentine's Day.

Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday that eating inside during a pandemic can be done, but only if it's ""done carefully.""

""If you do indoor dining, you do it in a spaced way where you don't have people sitting right next to each other,"" the director of the the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told CNN's Don Lemon. ""Good airflow"" is key, he said. What you want to avoid is breathing in other people's exhaled breath, which could be laden with virus.

Fauci said he feels for the restaurants that have been devastated by the pandemic. Restaurant and food service industry sales fell by $240 billion in 2020, according to the National Restaurant Association

""You know, people think sometimes that public health officials are oblivious to the economic considerations. Not at all -- I mean, we are very empathetic towards that,"" Fauci said. ""But we still have to maintain the public health measures if we're going to get our arms around this outbreak.""

You will not, however, catch Linsey Marr at a restaurant this Valentine's. Marr is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who has been studying Covid-19 transmission. She said when she and her family drove to Colorado over Christmas they stopped at a restaurant, picked up take out, and ate outside.

""It was 30 degrees, but we were properly dressed. You can do it,"" Marr said.

Marr is puzzled by the trend to reopen indoor dining. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines still say the safest way to enjoy and support restaurants is to take out food.

""I don't know why restaurants are reopening,"" said Marr. ""I don't think anything's changed from the time the restaurants were closed. If anything, it's riskier because of the new variants that are more transmissible.""

Marr said reduced capacity, improving ventilation, and adding filtration will help bring down the risk, but none of that eliminates it.

Marr points to a study from November that showed it only took minutes for two diners to become infected with Covid-19 from a diner who sat 15 feet away. The parties only overlapped by a few minutes at the restaurant, but because of the airflow, they got sick.

Marr said if someone just can't help themselves, and really wants to eat away from home, stick with eating outdoors if you are in a region where you won't get a side of frostbite with your lobster tail.

And outdoors has to truly mean outside.

""Not a structure that has been set up outdoors, because that becomes like indoors,"" Marr said.

If you have to eat indoors, she said maybe if the restaurant was empty that would be OK.

The public health experts suggest avoiding busy times at the restaurant. Check the restaurant's posted safety guidelines online before you go. Can you self park or do you have to valet? The CDC says if you have to valet, leave the windows open and air the car out for 15 minutes before dropoff and when picking up.

If there are crowds at the restaurant, find a table that's about 10 feet away from the others. Masks are essential. The servers, the host, and the diners when not eating, all need to wear them.

Dr. Donald Milton adds that he'd like to see people wear higher-quality masks that fit well and can help protect the wearer, as well as protect others, especially with the more transmissible variants.

""We need better masks, especially for those who will be around people who aren't wearing a mask,"" said Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health who studies how viruses are transmitted.

Not only can diners pass the virus to one another while they are eating or talking to each other, but those tiny droplets can go up into the air and float around for awhile and, depending on the restaurant's ventilation, those droplets can spread beyond 6 feet.

Improved ventilation can help. Germ-killing ultraviolet-C lamps hung up at ceiling level, like those installed in some hospitals, can break apart viruses if air is circulated towards them.

""I think that there are ways that we can make restaurants and dining much safer,"" Milton said. ""We need to learn what they are and do these things, but it's going to take some investment.""

In the meantime, behavior changes can help. Make sure only people from the same household sit at one table.

""Not sitting close to another table can help, or sitting on a patio outdoors, maybe, but it all depends on what way the air is moving,"" Milton said. ""It's really a lot about the plume. If you're in that cloud and it's the coronavirus, that's bad news.""

For now, Milton said, for his Valentine's dinner, he's going to do delivery.

""It's clear,"" Milton said. ""Any place people take off masks and congregate together is dangerous for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. That hasn't changed."""
Prosecutors charge 3 men for alleged actions against law enforcement during Capitol riot,"(CNN) Federal prosecutors have charged three men, in three states, for their alleged actions against law enforcement officers during the Capitol riot and insurrection on January 6.

Peter Schwartz of Owensboro, Kentucky, and Kyle Fitzsimons of Lebanon, Maine, were charged with forcibly assaulting, resisting or impeding officers.

Lake St. Louis, Missouri, resident Paul Scott Westover's affidavit, criminal complaint and charges remain under seal, but US Attorney's Office spokesperson Venton Blandin confirmed to CNN that Westover was charged with obstruction, impeding or interfering with law enforcement.

CNN has found that 189 people have been charged in federal court as of Thursday evening, according to Justice Department announcements and court records.

In an affidavit filed in the Schwartz case, investigators identified him as the man seen in online video spraying officers with ""an orange substance from a black canister.""

""The canister wielded by SCHWARTZ appears identical to MPD issued MK-9 pepper spray, which is regularly carried and was carried by MPD officers on January 6, 2021,"" the affidavit reads. ""Additionally, the officers' reaction to the spray was consistent with the substance being a chemical irritant.""

The affidavit claims that Schwartz also ""used a large red canister to spray law enforcement with what appeared to be mace. ...""

Schwartz was also charged with knowingly entering a restricted building or grounds, knowingly remaining in a restricted building or grounds and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to the affidavit.

An attorney for Schwartz was not listed in court records as of Thursday evening. He was ordered by a federal judge to be detained until a detention hearing next Wednesday.

In the affidavit filed against Fitzsimons, investigators say Capitol surveillance cameras recorded him, dressed in a dark blue sweater and white coat, attacking officers at the terrace archway.

""[Fitzsimons] was observed pushing and grabbing against officers who were holding a police line,"" investigators wrote in the affidavit.

When officers hit him with their batons, investigators say, the video shows Fitzsimons lowering his shoulder and charging at officers.

""After officers fought off FITZSIMONS, surveillance footage depicted FITZSIMONS retreating back into the crowd,"" investigators went on to say in the affidavit.

Investigators also identified him in photos showing a man with blood dripping down his face. Fitzsimons later said, according to the affidavit, that he had to go to the hospital to get stitches.

He explained his presence near the tunnel entryway of the Capitol at a January 7 town meeting in Lebanon, Maine, according to investigators, saying that anyone near it was ""sucked in,"" and pushed toward the police.

On Christmas Eve, investigators noted, Fitzsimons tried to organize a caravan to go to Washington on January 6, saying in part, ""If a call went out for able bodies, would there be an answer?""

Fitzsimons has also been charged with knowingly entering a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds and certain acts during a civil disorder, according to the affidavit.

Prosecutors filed a motion on Thursday evening to have Fitzsimons remain in detention during his trial. In that motion, they claimed he was a serious flight risk and posed a risk to the ""safety of any other person and the community.""

An attorney for Fitzsimons was not listed in court records as of Thursday evening.

The details surrounding Westover's alleged obstruction, impeding or interfering with law enforcement charge are unclear because the court documents remain under seal. His attorney, Joe Hogan, was unable to share the statement of facts prosecutors filed in the case; he did say, in regard to the felony obstruction charge, ""The charging documents are very vague.""

Westover was also charged with knowingly entering a restricted building, disorderly conduct which impedes government business and disruptive conduct in the Capitol, according to the US Attorney's Office spokesman, Venton Blandin.

Hogan said his client had traveled to Washington because the ""President of the United States said come on down, it's going to be wild."" He said Westover was accompanied by Emily Hernandez and her uncle, William Berry; prosecutors have charged those two, as well, in connection to the riot.

Westover doesn't belong to any groups, Hogan said. The attorney said he believes that his client regrets ever going to Washington.

In court, Hogan said prosecutors recommended that Westover be released on his own recognizance ahead of his next scheduled court hearing, on February 25.

The flurry of activity in federal court comes as the number of new defendants made public each day has slowed, after weeks of the Justice Department bringing as many as 10 or more cases in court nearly every day."
Here are the states allowing teachers to get Covid-19 vaccines,"As the debate rages over when it's safe for children to resume in-person classes, 26 states plus Washington, DC, are allowing some or all of their teachers and school staff to receive Covid-19 vaccines.

Several governors are making teachers a priority.

In West Virginia, all teachers over the age of 50 who said they wanted the vaccine have already received it, according to Governor Jim Justice. In Ohio, Governor Mike DeWine has set a plan to have all teachers vaccinated by the end of February, with the goal of all students returning to classrooms by March 1.

Other states, like Rhode Island and Vermont, are not prioritizing any specialized groups other than healthcare workers, and are distributing vaccines strictly by age.

Of the 26 states that have now made teachers eligible, there is still the matter of availability. In several of those states, some counties are moving more quickly than others to reach the Phase or Group numbers that include educators.

There are 24 states where teachers are still not eligible to receive the vaccine as a specific group -- although some educators might fall into the age group that state is vaccinating.

States have different styles for describing the phases of the vaccination -- and they have flexibility in how they can prioritize -- although they are broadly based on CDC recommendations.

On February 8, the state extended vaccine eligibility to additional groups, including people 65 or older and people who work in the education sector: teachers, support staff, community college and higher education.

Education and child care workers are placed in the group Priority Phase 1B, which has been reached statewide. Counties largely determine at what level to distribute vaccines. Some counties have advanced to Phase 1B, which includes essential workers and adults with high-risk conditions.

The state is in Phase 1-B, which includes teachers and school staff as well as other essential workers. The phase began January 18 and is expected to last through April before opening up to individuals 65 and older, as well as those with high-risk conditions.

Educators in select counties are eligible to receive the vaccine, as categorized in 1B Tier One. The state is anticipating a more widespread distribution network for teachers and staff in mid-February.

Phase 1B.2 started on February 8 and includes child care workers in licensed child care programs, teachers (full-time and substitutes), bus, food, counselors, administrative, safety and other support services offered inside the school.

The state has reached Phase 1b. Teachers and education staff are eligible to receive the vaccine, as are child care providers.

Teachers are included as part of the ""frontline essential workers"" category able to receive the vaccine.

As part of the state's Group 2, Pre-K through 12th grade teachers, school staff and daycare/child care staff are eligible for vaccination.

Currently at Phase 1b, teachers, education staff, student aides and day care workers are eligible for vaccination, along with other frontline essential workers.

Teachers, staff, and child care workers are in Phase 1B, Tier 1, and are eligible along with first responders and those aged 65 and older.

The state is currently in Phase 2, which includes teachers and staff at K-12 schools, including drivers and custodians. Those working in child care are also eligible.

Educators and school personnel initially became eligible at different times throughout the state depending on their location, yet this has now ramped up statewide. Governor Andy Beshear has aimed to complete initial vaccinations for those eligible by early February.

Teachers and staff at K-12 schools along with day care providers were part of Phase 1B. The state has since entered 1C.

PreK-12 teachers and childcare providers have been eligible since January 11, along with other frontline essential workers and first responders.

Teachers, K-12 staff and child care staff were included in an expansion of access called the community vaccine program.

Educators, staff and daycare providers are eligible under Tier I. However, residents age 65 and older are given priority.

Each county in Nevada is responsible for determining eligibility. Some counties are now including educators and staff.

Educators, staff and licensed child care providers have been included in eligibility for vaccination as part of Phase 1b.

The state is aiming to vaccinate all employees of K-12 schools before March 1, the target date for in-person school reopening.

Teachers, staff and child care providers are part of Phase 1B, group 1, and gained eligibility to receive the vaccine in the last week of January.

Educators have yet to receive eligibility statewide since Pennsylvania remains in Phase 1a, however those in Philadelphia County are under a separate vaccine plan and entered Phase 1b. Frontline essential workers in 1b, including those in education, are now eligible.

Teachers and staff in K-12 and child care are eligible under Phase 1b, which some counties have reached and commenced with distribution.

K-12 teachers and staff are eligible for vaccination statewide. Governor Spencer Cox said last month the state aims to get all education workers vaccinated by the end of February.

Teachers and staff at schools and child care centers are eligible in certain counties that have hit Phase 1B, Group 2.

Teachers over the age of 50 are eligible to receive inoculations. Those under the age of 50 will be offered vaccination at a later date.

K-12 educators and child care providers are listed as eligible in Phase 1B, Groups 5 and 6. Some counties have started vaccinations for those in that tier."
Seattle hospital cancels Covid-19 vaccine appointments after concerns about equity,"(CNN) Seattle Children's Hospital canceled 1,300 Covid-19 vaccine appointments out of concern over equal access to sign up.

""Shortly after releasing appointments, we decided we needed broader communication to the greater public of available vaccine appointments as we want to achieve the widest reach possible,"" the hospital said Thursday in a statement sent to CNN.

People hoping to be vaccinated signed up Tuesday through MyChart, an online account used by people with an existing patient relationship to the hospital. But some health care providers in Washington state have come under criticism in recent weeks for first notifying vaccine availability to people who have prior history with the facility.

Demand for vaccines has exceeded the supply in most states, and officials say the already limited distribution is not making its way proportionally to Black and Latino communities . As calls for increased production and administration grow, some organizations are also working to make sure doses are made more equally available.

Republicans refuse to purge their party of lies and hateful rhetoric,"(CNN) After four years of refusing to hold Donald Trump accountable for his lies, conspiracy theories and hateful rhetoric, Republicans passed up another chance to purge those forces from their ranks Thursday when they overwhelmingly opposed Democrats' efforts to rebuke Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene .

The GOP is complaining that Democratic leaders are not only overreaching but also setting a dangerous precedent in both punishing Greene and pursuing a doomed-to-fail impeachment trial for an ex-President in the Senate next week.

But genuinely unprecedented events have forced Democrats to take action. Despite national outrage about Trump's undemocratic actions, only 10 House Republicans voted to impeach him last month. And most Republicans balked Thursday at punishing Greene for espousing the dangerous lies and violent rhetoric that threaten the future of their party, with only 11 House Republicans joining Democrats in voting to kick Greene off her committees.

Before being elected to Congress from Georgia, Greene compiled a long list of unhinged comments and social media posts , including endorsement of violence against and assassinations of top Democrats, 9/11 trutherism and denials of school shootings. For weeks, she was unrepentant -- at least until her fate was sealed Thursday, when she showed shades of contrition on the House floor -- though her combative speech adopted many of the outlandish tropes of Trumpism.

Paradoxically, by seeking to punish Trump and Greene, Democrats may actually be helping to perpetuate the cycle of victimhood and complaints about ""cancel culture"" that each uses to crank up the anger of their radical base. Greene has seized Trump's mantle by remaining defiant and insisting that she will not apologize for her mistakes in interviews and social media posts. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the move by Democrats to take away the congresswoman's committee assignments a ""partisan power grab.""

Rather than taking full responsibility for her actions in her Thursday speech, Greene said the media that exposed her lies and lunacy is as bad as the QAnon conspiracy theory she espoused. She called Democrats -- rather than Trump's rioters who invaded the Capitol on January 6 -- a ""mob.""

""It's not just me they want to cancel. They want to cancel every Republican,"" she tweeted on Thursday before the vote. ""Don't let the mob win.""

The Trump playbook

Greene is following a familiar playbook. Trump has long used the idea of victimhood as an anchor of his appeal to grassroots supporters who feel ostracized from the Washington establishment. In fact, one of the pillars of his defense in his Senate impeachment trial next week will be an argument that Democrats are trying to cancel his right of free speech -- which he used to discredit a fair election and to send a mob to sack the Capitol. That's a message Greene echoed with her mask on Thursday, which read, ""Free Speech.""

Greene's loss of her committee assignments may actually give her an opportunity to portray her rebuke as the result of standing up to liberals and even ""establishment"" members of her own party. She has told her supporters she has raised at least $1.6 million during the uproar over the past week. And she's now sure to become a star of right-wing conservative media and the Republican primary circuit while establishing a template for how an extremist, conspiratorial, outsider can swiftly gain fame and political power in only a few weeks in Washington.

While just 11 House Republicans voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments Thursday night, 61 voted the night before to remove Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney , the third-ranking member of the conference, from her leadership position over her vote to impeach Trump.

Rather than showing contrition on the eve of the vote to oust her from House committees, Greene told The Washington Examiner that in removing her from her assignments Democrats ""don't even realize they're helping me. I'm pretty amazed at how dumb they are.""

She argued that the loss of her committee assignments would give her more time to help future candidates of her ilk in the 2022 midterms. She has said she hopes to keep driving the Republican Party further to the right in Trump's image, telling the Examiner that Trump is ""sick and tired of weak Republicans that won't fight.""

Apparently looking to score points as an outsider, she also called Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ""Mr. Big Turtle"" and described McCarthy as ""all talk and no action"" in the interview.

""The entire Marjorie Taylor Greene disaster has been a meteor headed directly at the GOP conference since she won her primary. She should have been put on the bench then,"" said Republican strategist Rob Stutzman. ""But the President liked her -- and liked the Q crazies because they liked him. GOP leadership needs to get onto cutting this craziness out of the party or it will proliferate.""

""Think of Greene as a virus. Forceful and decisive action has to be taken to prevent the spread,"" Stutzman added. ""It's difficult to see majorities in either chamber in 2022 if this defines us.""

Republicans could have taken more forceful action to drive Greene and her radical sentiments from their party at any time in the last few months -- or over the past year when she was running for Congress. Instead, Greene got a standing ovation from many in the House Republican Conference meeting Wednesday night. Similarly, a majority of the House GOP voted not to certify President Joe Biden's election, relying on a fantasy of lies by Trump and ignoring his failure to produce any evidence of fraud.

The former President on Thursday declined to answer for his seditious behavior, turning down a request by House impeachment managers to testify for his trial. Nevertheless, the vast majority of Republican senators will punt on casting judgment on the unprecedented insurrection incited by an outgoing President -- by taking refuge in the dubious claim that the trial is moot because he's a former President.

Charting their 2022 path

The furor over Trump and Greene shows that even with the ex-President out of office, most of the Washington GOP is not willing to take issue with the radical fringe that festers among its most loyal voters.

By backing Greene and refusing to take action against her reprehensible rhetoric, McCarthy has made clear that he believes the path to victory in the midterm elections lies in the support of those who manage to keep extremist voters within their ranks.

""In the House, I tell you what I think's going on. I think they're trying to play both sides,"" former Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" on Thursday. ""They don't want to aggravate the people who sort of sign up to QAnon and these conspiracy theories. They don't want to aggravate them but they also want to win the majority. It's all a fight for power.""

McCarthy's approach also means that the hopes of establishment Republicans, especially in the Senate, that the end of Trump's presidency will lead to an ideological reset for the party are likely to be dashed, in the short-term at least.

For many in the party, Trump's unrepentant departure after trying to tear democracy down with false claims of vote fraud and Greene's rocket to fame as a ""Make America Great Again"" heroine are a nightmare scenario.

The direction of the GOP raises the question whether its endless quest to appease its most agitated base activists will yet again squander its support among more moderate voters in the suburbs where elections are won.

""I do think as a party we have to figure out what we stand for, and I think we've got to be a party of ideas and policies and principles and get away from members dabbling in conspiracy theories,"" South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune told CNN's Manu Raju on Thursday. ""I don't think that's a productive course of action or one that's going to lead to much prosperity politically in the future.""

As establishment Republicans in the Senate fret at the pandemonium being unleashed by their House colleagues, Democrats are already making an aggressive effort to brand Greene and her ilk as the authentic face of the GOP.

""The House Republican Conference has been taken over by QAnon caucus, the crackpot caucus and the conspiracy caucus at the same time,"" Democratic House Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries told CNN's Erin Burnett Thursday night.

""The party of Lincoln is gone. The party of Reagan is gone. The party of John McCain is gone. This is now the party of Marjorie Taylor Greene."""
"Winter is here. Snowy, soggy, and frigid temperatures settle in for the long haul","(CNN) Heavy snow, blustery winds, and bitterly cold temperatures make for a very frozen start to February for those in the Midwest and northeastern US.

Just days after many in the Midwest and Northeast were digging out from record snow, even more flakes will be flying as we head into the weekend.

Winter weather alerts are posted for more than 25 million people Friday as heavy snow slides through the Great Lakes region early in the day. By the afternoon, that system will begin to shift into the Northeast.

Most areas along the Great Lakes will pick up an additional 2-4 inches, with some isolated higher amounts thanks to the added benefit of lake effect snow.

Rain will be the main focus from Virginia down through Florida. Thunderstorms will also be likely for much of the Florida Peninsula on Saturday.

A low-pressure system that will develop off the coast of the Carolinas will slide up the East Coast Sunday. The system's proximity to the New England coast will determine whether many northeastern cities get rain or snow.

""The system will intensify as it tracks off the Eastern Seaboard, and has the potential to bring another round of significant snow across the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Northeast,"" says Dave Hennen, CNN Meteorologist.

""There is currently a lot of uncertainty in where/who will get the most snow and whether the major metro areas in the Northeast get hit.""

Chicago closes Covid-19 testing sites

Due to the anticipated ""inclement weather,"" city-operated Covid-19 testing sites in the Chicago area will close for five days, Chicago's Office of Emergency Management announced Thursday.

The closures, which will run through February 10, will impact mobile-testing operations as well as static sites at Midway Airport, Douglass Park, Prosser Career Academy, and Gately Park. Each site services roughly 1,000 patients per day when operational, the Chicago Department of Public Health told CNN.

Chicago is under a winter weather advisory until Friday at noon; and while flurries of snowfall are expected, the main concern is wind. Gusts are expected to reach as high as 45 mph.

The area is also at risk for excessive cold, with wind chills well below zero during the weekend and into next week

Residents in need of Covid-19 testing during that time are asked to contact their primary care provider or seek an alternate testing location.

You can't have snow without cold

""While it can be too warm to snow, it cannot be too cold to snow,"" according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) website. ""Snow can occur even at incredibly low temperatures as long as there is some source of moisture and some way to lift or cool the air. It is true, however, that most heavy snowfalls occur when there is relatively warm air near the ground -- typically -9 degrees C (15 degrees F) or warmer -- since warmer air can hold more water vapor.""

The coldest air will start pushing through the upper Midwest on Saturday. Waking up Saturday morning, at least half a dozen states will see temperatures below zero. Even high temperatures are expected to be 25-30 degrees below normal in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, and the Dakotas.

Temperatures Sunday morning

From there, the cold air spreads south and east in the following days.

""Another reinforcing cold front will move through the region Sunday morning,"" says the National Weather Service Office in Cleveland. ""Temperatures will be the coldest so far this season this weekend into early next week with below-average temperatures lingering through next week.""

From Sunday through Thursday of next week, Cleveland will see high temperatures 15-20 degrees below normal, keeping them below freezing for almost a full week.

It's not just the Midwest that will be seeing this deep freeze. Southern states like Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi will be 15 to 30 degrees below normal Tuesday and Wednesday.

Another concern is how the bitter cold air will affect the flow of water and traffic on the major rivers in the Midwest.

""Areas to our south -- the lower portions of the upper Mississippi and the Illinois River -- are seeing relatively decent flows and levels are good for navigation, especially around St. Louis, but extreme cold outbreaks give us a concern for ice bites, which takes flow out of the river,"" said Justin Palmer, a hydrologist with the North Central River Forecast Center in Chanhassen, Minnesota.

""Ice gets created in the pools, we drop a lot of flow, which drops stages and becomes an issue for potential groundings. On the Illinois River, however, with this extreme push of cold air, we could potentially see some ice form, but overall, we're seeing good traffic in St. Louis and believe this year the rivers have been more open with this warmer year.""

Ice bite events are associated with frigid cold weather. Ice formation in rivers often causes reductions in flow downstream, which drops water levels , making them unnavigable. This can have a significant impact at St. Louis, leading to low water levels that ground navigation and expose water intakes.

The polar vortex is on the move

This frigid cold is compliments of the polar vortex , a large area of low pressure located near the poles. During the winter months, it breaks down, sending cold air that has been bottled up. It can be responsible for extremely frigid temperatures and huge plunges of cold air."
Rochester mayor offers police reform proposals after a 9-year-old girl is handcuffed and pepper-sprayed,"(CNN) A week after a 9-year-old girl was handcuffed and pepper-sprayed by police officers in Rochester, New York, the city's mayor on Thursday outlined a draft of police reform recommendations aimed at protecting ""the sanctity of life.""

""At the heart of it, we need to place the sanctity of human life at the core of RPD's [Rochester Police Department] policing philosophy,"" said Mayor Lovely Warren said during a virtual press conference.

Warren did not specifically mention the January 29 incident involving the 9-year-old girl, but said it needs to be made clear that officers should not handcuff ""juveniles 12 and under unless they present an imminent danger to themselves or others.""

""The current draft doesn't specify imminent, however, my recommendation would be to change that,"" Warren said.

Two body camera videos released by Rochester police show officers restraining the child, putting her in handcuffs and attempting to get her inside the back of a police vehicle as she repeatedly cried and called for her father.

'No room for debate or compromise' as Hong Kong introduces sweeping national security rules for schools,"Hong Kong (CNN) Hong Kong has introduced sweeping new restrictions for how schools operate, months after the Beijing government imposed a new national security law giving authorities wide-ranging powers to crack down on vaguely defined political crimes.

For years, parents and students in the semi-autonomous city have feared a shift toward China-style ""patriotic education,"" with a previous attempt to introduce such a curriculum defeated by mass protests in 2012. The new rules, coming in the wake of both the new security law and a crackdown on the city's opposition movement, go far beyond what was previously mooted.

A spokesman for the bureau said that in accordance with the national security law, ""preventive efforts should be accorded priority in order to minimize the need for suppression and punishment.""

""Schools have a significant role to play"" in this, he added.

Speaking at a news conference Thursday, Ip Kin-yuen, a former lawmaker and vice chairman of the Professional Teachers' Union, criticized the government for announcing the new policies without consulting teachers and parents.

""There is a lot of sensitivity and unpredictability when it comes to national security law education,"" he said. ""It will bring about huge pressure and anxiety among principals and teachers.""

New rules

The new policies are outlined in a series of circulars seen by CNN, as well as new teaching materials , including videos, picture books, and graphics, with cartoon Chinese soldiers and local police officers helping students understand their ""responsibilities"" under the security law.

They go into granular detail over how national security issues should be taught across a range of subjects, from general studies and history to biology and music, as well as how administrators and teachers should handle discipline issues and failure to respect the new guidelines.

""Let's Learn about National Security!"" pic.twitter.com/aFuPe3mN0K — 𝕛𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕤 𝕘𝕣𝕚𝕗𝕗𝕚𝕥𝕙𝕤 🇭🇰🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 (@jgriffiths) February 5, 2021

Both teachers and students who contravene the rules face potential censure, with administrators advised to involve the police in the event of ""serious"" offenses, while books and other materials deemed to be contrary to national security are to be removed from school grounds, though little precise guidance is offered for what materials are covered.

""If an employee is found to have committed any act of disrespecting the country, the school should give appropriate advice or warning, and pay attention to this employee's future performance accordingly,"" the rules state.

Students, both university and high school, were at the forefront of anti-government, pro-democracy protests which rocked Hong Kong for much of 2019. During the unrest and in the run-up to the national security law being introduced, many pro-government figures blamed the city's liberal education curriculum, as well as teachers, for supposedly radicalizing the city's young people.

""We lost two generations, we lost them through the schools,"" a top adviser to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told CNN at the height of the unrest.

""The fundamental problem is that you have a whole generation of young people who are not just dead against, but actually hate China,"" the aide said, on the condition on anonymity. ""How are you going to have 'one country, two systems' work if you have a whole generation hating that country?""

While members of the city's democratic opposition have dismissed these claims, pointing out that many of them did not receive the supposedly radical lessons, which were only introduced in 2009, this has not stopped the push to ""reform"" Hong Kong's education system.

In her annual policy address last November, Lam, the city's Beijing-appointed leader, said the 2019 protests had ""led many to question again the effectiveness of Hong Kong's education.""

""We cannot bear to see that with the infiltration of politics into school campuses, students are drawn into political turbulence or even misled to engage in illegal and violent acts, for which they have to take legal responsibilities that will impact on their lives,"" Lam said, adding it was ""the shared responsibility of the government, society, education sector and parents to find a way to protect our students.""

JUST WATCHED How 2020 saw Hong Kong change forever Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How 2020 saw Hong Kong change forever 03:40

Political controls

Under the new guidelines, inculcation of the tenets of national security will start early.

Kindergartens -- both private and public -- will be expected to instill in their students a greater knowledge of ""Chinese history, Chinese culture, and moral education,"" which the guidelines say will ""gradually build up students' identity as a Chinese and thus lay the foundation for national security education.""

Beginning at the age of 6, all students in Hong Kong will receive new lessons aimed at helping them ""understand the country's history and development, the importance of national security, the national flag, national emblem and national anthem.""

Primary school students will be instructed in singing the national anthem and raising the flag, while older children will discuss the rationale behind the law itself, and the importance of institutions such as the People's Liberation Army.

Nor are international schools -- which are popular among both foreign residents and wealthier locals -- exempt from the new guidelines.

While private educational institutions are not directly under the control of the EDB, the rules issued Thursday state that international and private schools ""have the responsibility to help their students (regardless of their ethnicity and nationality) acquire a correct and objective understanding ... of the concept of national security and the National Security Law, as well as the duty to cultivate a law-abiding spirit among their students.""

Hong Kong's education system is already notoriously intense for students, while the city's international schools command high fees and are tough to gain admission to, meaning the new rules might be the final straw for some parents who were already considering moving abroad

This week, the United Kingdom launched its resettlement program for holders of British Nationals (Overseas) passports, of which there are an estimated 3 million in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has reacted angrily to the plan and said it will no longer recognize BN(O) documents, but still an estimated 300,000 people are expected to relocate to the UK.

Others are moving to Canada and Australia, where many Hong Kongers hold dual residency, while several prominent activists and politicians have sought asylum in the UK, Germany and the United States.

""The (exodus) is already happening, especially for families with small kids,"" opposition lawmaker Lester Shum said last year. ""If I put myself in their shoes, I can understand the fear and the worry that they have about the next generation. Children cannot reasonably have bright prospects or a bright future in Hong Kong, and so in order to protect that ... it's understandable why people want to leave.""

Chinese Young Pioneers wearing face masks take part in a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square on October 1, 2020 in Beijing, China.

Concerns for teachers

For school employees, both administrators and teachers, the new rules open up the concerning possibility of being reported by students for contravening national security, something that could result in them losing their jobs or, in extreme incidences, being arrested.

Last year, the city's former leader, CY Leung, launched a campaign to name and shame teachers he said had been involved in the 2019 protests, posting their personal details on his Facebook page and calling for them to be fired.

In mainland China, such reporting of teachers who go against the Party line is relatively routine , both on high school and university campuses, and regular campaigns are conducted to ensure educators' ideological purity, while ""student information officers"" compile dossiers on teachers deemed to be insufficiently patriotic.

While for many older Chinese these practices have worrying echoes of the Cultural Revolution, in which teenage Red Guards frequently abused and even murdered teachers, such campaigns have ramped up under Chinese President Xi Jinping.

On Thursday, China's government issued new guidelines for ""strengthening the work of the Chinese Young Pioneers,"" (CYP) a Communist Party youth wing which ""serves as a school for children to learn about socialism with Chinese characteristics and communism.""

""The guideline stressed upholding the Party's leadership over the CYP work, and following the fundamental task of nurturing capable young people who are well-prepared to join the communist cause,"" according to state news agency Xinhua."
"Covid-19 vaccine progress made on several fronts, and experts are encouraged","(CNN) The United States has seen progress on several fronts against Covid-19 this week -- including the opening of new mass inoculation sites and a third vaccine maker seeking authorization.

While health experts are concerned that more-transmissible coronavirus variants could worsen spread of the disease -- and in some cases put up a measure of resistance to vaccines -- some are also encouraged by where vaccination efforts are headed.

""Overall, things are definitely getting better,"" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the vaccine education center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN Friday.

Consider:

• The country has averaged 1.3 million new shots of Covid-19 vaccines a day over the last week despite a snowstorm that temporarily closed some sites in the Northeast. That's up from 1.1 million at one point last week, according to federal data , and moving toward President Joe Biden's hope of 1.5 million per day

• Several mass-vaccination sites were set to open Friday. New York's Yankee Stadium began serving eligible residents of the Bronx Friday morning. Others set to open include San Francisco's Moscone Center and two sites in Maryland, including Six Flags America in Bowie. And National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell has written to Biden , committing to use every team stadium as a mass vaccination site.

• As soon as next week, pharmacies such as those at CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger and Publix will offer vaccines in select stores and states to people who are eligible. One million doses will be sent to about 6,500 pharmacies in the first phase of a federal program.

• Johnson & Johnson officially asked the US Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization of its one-dose Covid-19 vaccine Thursday. If approved, it would be the third vaccine in the US market, joining two-dose products from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.

An FDA advisory committee will meet about the request February 26. The panel will make a recommendation that the FDA will consider when it makes a decision about whether to authorize.

Johnson & Johnson has reported what appears to be lower efficacy than the other two vaccines in preventing moderate disease. But the company has emphasized its candidate was tested when certain virus strains were more prevalent -- and that it still was 85% effective against severe disease.

And experts have pointed to potential advantages: Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Johnson & Johnson's would take only one shot; it does not have to be stored in freezers; and it can be stored for three months at refrigerator temperatures.

The addition of a new vaccine will boost supply and allow more people to be inoculated faster, Offit and other experts have said.

And ""the weather is going to get warmer, and when that happens, it makes it less easy for this virus to be transmitted,"" Offit said.

""I really do think that we will get on top of this by summer or late summer, because I think everything now is moving in the right direction,"" Offit said.

Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's school of public health, also said Friday the vaccination situation in the US ""is getting better.""

""We're doing about 1.3 million (shots) a day (and) it got thrown off a little by the snowstorm ,"" Jha said. ""We can get to 2 (million a day), or even better than that.""

Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, has warned more contagious coronavirus variants still could spur significant surges of infections in the coming weeks, and that vaccines alone may not prevent this

New York to offer vaccines to people with underlying conditions

New York may be the first state to offer vaccine access to people with comorbidity, or the simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions, no matter their age.

""New Yorkers with comorbidities and underlying conditions exist throughout the state's population -- they're our teachers, lawyers and carpenters, in addition to the doctors who keep us safe every day, and they are a highly affected population,"" said Gov. Andrew Cuomo. ""We're committed to vaccinating vulnerable populations that have suffered the most as we distribute a strictly limited supply of vaccines, and people with comorbidities are 94 percent of the state's COVID deaths.""

The governor's office listed cancer, chronic kidney disease, pulmonary disease and heart conditions as some of the comorbidities and underlying conditions that the state will use to determine eligibility for the Covid-19 vaccine.

Starting February 15, doses reserved for hospital workers will be reallocated to those with comorbidities if hospital workers haven't used them, Cuomo said Friday.

About 75% of hospital workers have been vaccinated, and those who haven't will have until then to get their shots before access is opened to others.

Health departments will work with the state and the CDC to further determine which medical conditions qualify.

People line up for vaccines at New York's Yankee Stadium on Friday, the day its mass-inoculation site for Bronx residents debuted.

Model predicts steadily dropping death rate -- unless variants intervene

How quickly the variants spread versus the speed of vaccinations will be a key factor in the number of coronavirus deaths over the coming months, according to a forecast from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

Currently, IHME projects the country's number of Covid-19 deaths per day will drop steadily through June 1, in part because of vaccine rollouts and polls showing increasing percentages of Americans saying they're willing to get vaccines.

The US has averaged more than 3,230 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week, not far from the record average of 3,357 set on January 13, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The IHME says its most-likely projected scenario would have deaths per day dropping to just under 2,000 by March 1; to 1,486 by April 1; to 1,245 by May 1; and 628 by June 1.

But in a worst-case scenario, including rampant variant spread, daily death rates could rise again by March -- and even exceed 2,600 a day by mid-April before dipping, the IHME says.

""If the variants are more widespread and people go back to their previous life faster"" after being vaccinated, ""then you get closer to our worst scenario that we put out,"" IHME Director Dr. Chris Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper Friday night.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the B.1.1.7 variant could be the dominant US strain in March. This variant first identified in the UK, is already on track to becoming dominant in hotspots like Florida and Southern California ""within a few weeks,"" according to a testing company called Helix that has helped identify the largest share of US cases.

At least one case, that of a man who was chronically infected over months, indicates that variants aren't just coming from overseas but can be home grown in US patients

Genetic tests showed that the patient, who had an underlying condition that weakened his immunity, had been infected with the same virus all along but that it had been evolving as it replicated.

""It was incredible,"" said Dr. Jonathan Li, who leads a lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston studying viruses and their mutations and had been called in to help study the patient's case.

For now, Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations in the US have been dipping after a holiday-era surge.

The country has averaged about 130,402 new Covid-19 cases a day over the last week -- down more than 47% since a peak average of more than 249,000 a day on January 8, according to Johns Hopkins data.

The number of Covid-19 patients n US hospitals Thursday was 88,688 -- the lowest since November 24.

CDC director: Guidance on reopening schools to be released in the coming week

The CDC will release guidance on school reopenings in the coming week , CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a White House briefing on Friday.

During the briefing, CNN asked whether one of Walensky's previous comments about schools -- that with proper distancing, masking and testing in place, schools could safely resume in-person classes even before all teachers get vaccinated -- was the CDC's official guidance.

""Our goal is to get children back to school,"" Walensky said Friday. ""Schools should be the last places closed and the first places open. Our goal is to make sure in getting children back to school that we do so both with the safety of the children and the safety of the teachers"" in place.

""Among the things that we need to do to make sure that schools are safe is to make sure that the community spread of the disease is down,"" Walensky said. ""We are actively working on the guidance, the official guidance, which will be released in the week ahead.""

So far, 24 states and Washington, DC, are explicitly allowing some teachers or school staff to receive the vaccine.

Biden administration plans to make 60 million at-home tests available this summer

The Biden administration announced on Friday that under the Defense Production Act, about 60 million at-home Covid-19 tests will be made available for the public by the end of this summer.

Those tests will be in addition to the at-home tests from the company Ellume that the administration previously announced, Tim Manning, Covid-19 supply coordinator, said during a White House news briefing.

""The country's well behind where we need to be in testing,"" Manning said.

""Over the coming weeks, the US government has plans to invest in another six suppliers to rapidly surge testing capability,"" Manning said.

On Monday, Andy Slavitt, the senior Biden White House adviser for Covid response, said during a White House briefing that the US Department of Defense and US Department of Health and Human Services are working with Australian company Ellume to provide more of its fully at-home Covid-19 tests to the United States and ship 100,000 test kits per month to the United States from February through July.

Now, ""having 60 million more at-home tests available over the course of the summer is exactly what the country needs,"" Slavitt said during Friday's briefing."
"Ford posts strong results, promises big bet on electric and self-driving cars","New York (CNN Business) Ford reported surprisingly good financial results at the end of a tough year, and said it was increasing its commitment to vehicles of the future with a big bet on electric and autonomous driving vehicles.

The company said it will invest $29 billion in EVs and AVs. It will require a bit of a catch-up by Ford, which just came out with its first EV in years, the Mustang Mach E.

While Ford's statement spoke about taking a leadership position in EVs and AVs, some of its larger rivals are much further along in shifting to electric vehicles

""We watched one out of 10 vehicles sold in Europe in December be pure electric. EV sales in China continue to grow, and the reality is that customers, including in the US, are increasingly giving e-mobility greater consideration,"" said Ford CEO Jim Farley. ""We have no intention to cede ground to others."""
Opinion: Here's how we can safeguard our upcoming elections,"Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, is the Michigan secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is the Arizona secretary of state, and Steve Simon, a Democrat, is the Minnesota secretary of state. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Amid the hustle and bustle of a new administration -- especially one assembling in the aftermath of attempted insurrection and an ongoing pandemic -- it can be difficult to remember that Americans just emerged from the most successful, secure election in our country's history. Despite a similarly historic and unprecedented effort to deny that reality, we must build on our successes and strengthen our democracy for future elections.

The 2020 elections tested the integrity of our Constitution, the value of our votes and the sanctity of the work done by election officials like us. As secretaries of state, we are here to say with pride that the 2020 election was a resounding success. Amid a pandemic, new voting laws record-high turnout and unprecedented threats of violence , election officials across this country made sure that every valid vote was counted.

This week, as we meet with our colleagues from across the country at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, we have the opportunity to focus on what actually matters: making sure voting is convenient, accessible and safe. We must commit to building on our progress from 2020 by expanding access to the ballot box, improving election infrastructure and bolstering election security. This normally under-the-radar association meeting will play a pivotal role in determining the agenda for the next phase of election administration in this country.

We hope to see collective cues taken from some of the recently proposed reforms in the battleground states."
The compensation fund for alleged Jeffrey Epstein victims pauses payouts,"(CNN) The program compensating alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein will pause payouts because Epstein's estate is low on cash, program administrators announced Thursday.

Because of ""uncertainty"" over funding, the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program will hold compensation determination offers until March 25 or later depending on when the estate can provide the necessary funds to finish payouts, according to a press release

Over 150 claims have been filed for alleged Epstein victims so far, and the program has paid out over $50 million to eligible claimants -- a volume exceeding expectations, according to the press release.

Jordana Feldman, known for her work with the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, said she ""sincerely regrets"" the pause but stressed that the program is seeing to the best interests of program participants.

""Issuing a compensation offer that cannot be timely and fully funded and paid, consistent with the way the Program has operated to date, would compromise claimants' interests and the guiding principles of the Program,"" Feldman said in the release. ""I remain deeply committed to ensuring that the Program continues to operate with transparency and integrity, and that all eligible claimants receive the compensation and validation they deserve.""

'Bling Empire' is the new rich kid on the block,"A version of this story appeared in CNN's Pop Life Chronicles newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . Tell us what you'd like to see more of in the newsletter at entertainment.newsletter@cnn.com .

(CNN) If it seems like you are seeing more projects involving Asian performers and storytellers, you are not wrong.

Hollywood appears to be having a bit of a boom these days with content created by and starring people of Asian descent.

It's been a long time coming.

When ""Crazy Rich Asians"" was released in 2018, it became the first major Hollywood studio movie since ""The Joy Luck Club"" came out in '93 -- yes, 25 years prior -- to feature a predominantly Asian cast.

""We promote Asian storytelling. Not just Asian stories, but Asian people in stories with the full spectrum of the human experience,"" Chieng said at the time. ""When you say, 'Oh, it's not enough attention on Asians, it's more black and white, that game becomes like you're playing the discrimination Olympics.""

Here's where we are seeing more representation:

Kelly Mi Li (left) and Kane Lim (right) are shown in a scene from ""Bling Empire.""

Reality TV: ""Crazy Rich Asians"" ushered in a fascination with the wealthiest and most successful in the culture including docuseries ""House of Ho"" on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN's parent company) and ""Singapore Social"" on Netflix.

I talked to one of its cast members and producers, Christine Chiu, last week. She shared her theory as to why it has taken a while for reality projects about and starring Asians to catch Hollywood's attention.

""I believe that the Asian culture is just very private, I don't want to fault the entertainment industry for not giving us an earlier shot so to speak,"" Chiu said. ""I do feel that the industry does want to have cultural diversity because it does serve them well. Case in point, look at 'Bridgerton.'""

""Bling Empire"" also explores real racial and cultural challenges faced by some of the cast members, like model Kevin Kreider's identity struggle from having been adopted from Korea into a White family in the US. This topic is something he also had explored in Doris Yeung's 2019 documentary, ""The Ugly Model.""

And, of course, ""Indian Matchmaking"" was a huge hit for Netflix last year.

Lead character Raya is voiced by Kelly Marie Tran in ""Raya and the Last Dragon.""

And there are more projects coming.

The forthcoming Disney animated film ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" has sparked discussion.

The movie is about a young woman named Raya (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran), who is on a quest to find the last dragon in order to unite a people.

It features stars of Asian ethnicity, including Tran, Golden Globe-winning actress Sandra Oh, Awkwafina and Gemma Chan. But the casting stirred controversy , given that the story in the film has a Southeast Asian origin and many of the actors cast are of East Asian ancestry.

Maitreyi Ramakrishnan (third from left) stars in ""Never Have I Ever.""

Television: Netflix won both viewers and rave reviews last year for Netflix won both viewers and rave reviews last year for ""Never Have I Ever."" Starring Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, the dramedy is about a South Asian American teen and her life following a family tragedy.

Korean American actor Daniel Dae Kim shared the news last month that he has snagged his first lead role in a TV series in the second season of Nat Geo's anthology thriller ""The Hot Zone.""

""Hardly the biggest news given what's going on in the world today,"" he tweeted on January 13 . ""But after 31 years of working in TV, this is my first series lead.""

The TV gods giveth and they taketh away, however, as last year marked the ending of ""Fresh Off the Boat,"" a beloved sitcom about a Taiwanese American family that ran for six seasons on ABC.

It looks hella intense and I can't wait. ""Malcolm & Marie"" starts streaming Friday.

Erin Jackson appears in season two of ""Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready.""

'Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready' Season 2

Tiffany Haddish has found success in comedy and is sharing the wealth.

The second season of her series showcases comics like Erin Jackson, whom Haddish handpicked to perform 15-to-20-minute sets. Get ready to laugh your ... pandemic pounds off.

""They Ready"" is currently streaming on Netflix.

Two things to listen to:

Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters performs onstage during the ""Rock in Rio"" festival at the Olympic Park, Rio de Janeiro, in September 2019.

Believe it or not, the rock band Foo Fighters has been around for more than 25 years.

The group feels timeless partly because it just seems to keep getting better and better.

The band's latest, ""Medicine at Midnight,"" drops Friday and is its 10th studio album. The release was delayed because of the pandemic so we will get to see if it was worth the wait.

Cristela Alonzo attends the International Myeloma Foundation's 12th Annual Comedy Celebration at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre on November 3, 2018, in Los Angeles.

It tells the story of how 40 years ago a series of unsolved murders in Houston's Latino community led to the formation of the city's first all-Latino homicide squad. The five young officers had very little experience and resources at a time their community was suffering both discrimination and abuse from police.

""Chicano Squad"" is streaming now.

One thing to talk about:

The late Dustin Diamond played Screech on ""Saved by the Bell.""

Beloved as Screech on the popular high school comedy, Diamond never quite found the same amount of success after the show ended.

His 2009 book ""Behind the Bell"" put him at odds with some of his costars due to the backstage tea he spilled. He went on to perform stand-up and appear in reality shows, while some of his former costars continued acting.

There were also legal issues, which added to his woes. Diamond's death just weeks after revealing his battle with cancer and at such a young age ends any possibility of a different ending to his professional story.

Something to sip on

A video of country music star Morgan Wallen has surfaced in which he reportedly used a racial slur.

When the backlash hit country music artist Morgan Wallen after video of him using a racial slur had surfaced, two camps sprang up.

There were those in country music whose attitude was ""We're better than this"" and those who felt that ""Actually, we are not.""

Mickey Guyton is a Black country artist whose song ""Black Like Me"" stirred conversation last year about racism in the genre. She tweeted on Wednesday regarding the Wallen controversy: ""When I read comments saying 'this is not who we are' I laugh because this is exactly who country music is.""

She should know, given the racism that has been hurled her way.

And Guyton isn't the only one who spoke up.

Grammy-winning artist Maren Morris has long been an ally of the Black community and tweeted ""It actually IS representative of our town because this isn't his first 'scuffle' and he just demolished a huge streaming record last month regardless. We all know it wasn't his first time using that word.""

Wallen quickly lost the support of radio, his record label and others, but the issue is so much bigger than just him. Here's hoping this incident sparks the hard and necessary conversations and actions needed in the music industry."

Marjorie Taylor Greene's history of dangerous conspiracy theories and comments,"(CNN) Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is facing intense backlash for indicating support for political violence and pushing wild conspiracy theories and extreme anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic comments before she was elected to Congress.

The House voted Thursday evening to remove Greene from her committee assignments. On Wednesday, GOP House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republican Conference declined to take action against the freshman Republican for her violent endorsements and incendiary comments.

A CNN KFile review of both newly-uncovered and previously reported comments highlight the fringe nature of what Greene shared on and offline.

Greene defended herself ahead of the House vote in a floor speech Thursday as she tried to distance herself from her past conspiracy comments.

After Greene saw ""things in the news that didn't make sense to me,"" she said she ""stumbled across"" QAnon at the end of 2017. She became ""very interested"" in the theory and began posting about it on Facebook because she ""was upset about things"" and felt she could not trust the government.

""The problem with that is, though, is I was allowed to believe things that weren't true, and I would ask questions about them and talk about them, and that is absolutely what I regret,"" she said.

""Because if it weren't for the Facebook posts and comments that I liked in 2018, I wouldn't be standing here today and you couldn't point a finger and accuse me of anything wrong,"" continued Greene, who went on to blame the media, including CNN, for her comments.

Here are some of the most extreme things Greene has done:

Greene repeatedly indicated support for political violence and execution of top Democrats and FBI agents

As CNN's KFile previously reported , Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians -- including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry -- and FBI agents in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress.

Greene created a White House petition to impeach Pelosi for ""treason"" after Pelosi did not vote to fund former President Donald Trump's border wall in 2019. In newly found posts from 2019, she also wrote a ""press release"" and a previously unreported blog post promoting the petition and suggested that Pelosi could be executed for treason.

In other newly-uncovered tweets and posts, Greene also liked a call to put Pelosi to death. In one tweet , she said she hoped Pelosi would lose her memory sitting in prison.

Greene, in a statement, did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page. Greene did not specify whether she or a member of her team were behind the posts reviewed by CNN's KFile.

""Over the years, I've had teams of people manage my pages. Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views. Especially the ones that CNN is about to spread across the internet,"" Greene said in a statement last week.

CNN previously reported that Greene posted on her candidate Facebook page in September 2020 an image of herself holding a gun alongside images of Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. The caption encouraged going on the ""offense against these socialists"" and was interpreted by observers as a threat against the politicians. The Facebook post was taken down for violating its policies.

Greene's campaign told CNN in an emailed statement in September 2020 that those who think the picture incites violence ""are paranoid and ridiculous.""

""The only way you get your freedoms back is it's earned with the price of blood,"" she said in the video from 2020.

While she was a congresswoman-elect and a sitting congresswoman this January, Greene fanned the flames of the Capitol insurrection by encouraging the big lie that Trump, and not Joe Biden, won the election and objected to the election certification process. Greene later denounced the violence at the Capitol but falsely blamed it on ""BLM/Antifa violence"" in a statement.

Greene promoted violent, deranged conspiracy theories online

Before she ran for Congress, Greene embraced violent, fringe conspiracies. Chief among them was the QAnon conspiracy theory -- a discredited conspiracy that pits former President Trump in an imagined battle against a cabal of Satan-worshipping, child-abusing Democrats and celebrities -- though in August 2020 she tried to distance herself from QAnon and claimed that ""it doesn't represent me.""

One of the most disturbing violent conspiracies Greene engaged with in May 2018 is the ""Frazzledrip'' conspiracy , which exists deep within conspiracy rabbit hole. The conspiracy baselessly contends that Hillary Clinton and former Clinton aide Huma Abedin were videotaped sexually assaulting a child and then ripping off the child's face to wear as a mask in a Satanic blood sacrifice. The theory then alleges that Clinton ordered an assassination hit against the police officer who found the footage, named ""Frazzledrip,"" according to reporting from Media Matters.

After facing backlash from her plane comments, Greene said in August 2020 , ""Some people claimed a missile hit the Pentagon. I now know that is not correct. The problem is our government lies to us so much to protect the Deep State, it's hard sometimes to know what is real and what is not.""

In her floor speech on Thursday , Greene said, ""9/11 absolutely happened. I remember that day, crying all day long, watching it on the news. And it's a tragedy for anyone to say it didn't happen. So that I definitely want to tell you all, I do not believe it's fake.""

Greene peddled conspiracies that mass shootings were false flags and ""staged""

While Greene peddled violent conspiracy theories online, she often speculated if real-world violent events were part of a deeper conspiracy and were actually false flag operations, which refers to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups.

In 2018, she questioned whether the Parkland shooting that killed 17 people was a planned event and called Parkland survivor and activist David Hogg a ""paid actor."" In a recently surfaced video from March 2019 , Greene follows Hogg as he walks toward the US Capitol and can be heard making false and baseless claims as she asks him a series of questions related to gun rights and how he was able to meet with senators. Hogg continues to walk without addressing Greene.

At the end of the video, Greene calls Hogg a ""coward"" and claimed Hogg's activism was funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who is often the subject of far-right conspiracy theories, and other liberals. ""He can't say one word because he can't defend his stance,"" she said.

In another video , she mocked Hogg as an ""idiot"" who ""only talks when he is scripted.""

Greene also supported Facebook comments from 2018 that alleged the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed six adults and 20 children was a ""staged"" event.

In a statement posted on Twitter following intense backlash to some of her comments, Greene acknowledged that 17 people died in the Parkland shooting and blamed ""gun free"" zones at schools for the tragedy.

After live bombs were sent to Democratic politicians and CNN in October 2018, Greene repeatedly liked and agreed with multiple comments that the terrorist act was a ""false flag"" operation staged by Democrats.

In one little-remembered Facebook post from September 2018, Greene claimed that the mythical figure ""Q"" -- whom Greene had previously called a ""patriot"" --warned of false flags for school shootings.

She then questioned if a shooting at Kennesaw State University in Georgia that killed one person was ""a failed op? What about hearing voices? Mental illness? Demon possession? Or military grade intelligence developed weapons like Voice of God technology,"" which refers to a government-controlled device implanted in a person's head.

""We don't know, but I do believe all three of those exist,"" she wrote.

Greene made similar unreported comments about the ""Voice of God"" conspiracy on Twitter in 2018.

In her floor speech Thursday , Greene affirmed that ""school shootings are absolutely real and every child that is lost, those families mourn it.""

Greene spread anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic comments and conspiracies

On and offline, Greene frequently engaged with extreme anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Some of the targets of her comments included her future colleagues in the House of Representatives, like Tlaib and Omar, and Obama, who Greene falsely said is Muslim.

""These are women that really would like to see Sharia in America,"" Greene said in one since-deleted Facebook video, captured by CNN. Sharia refers to Islamic law, which is interpreted from the religious text of the Quran, and encompasses marriage, divorce, inheritance and punishments for criminal offenses.

""And as an American woman, as a business owner, as a mother, I have two daughters -- I never want to see Sharia in America. And so I really want to go talk to these ladies and ask them what they are thinking and why they're serving in our American government. They really should go back to the Middle East if they support Sharia. So let's go talk to them. Definitely want to go talk to them.""

In a 2018 Facebook comment, captured by CNN, Greene responded ""truth,"" to a comment comparing Obama to terrorist Osama bin Laden. The comment came in response to a post where Greene said the Obama presidency was ""flooding our country and government with Muslims that don't like our American ways!!!!!""

In another video from 2019, saved by CNN's KFile, Greene spoke about going into Omar's and Tlaib's offices and saying all Muslims want to take away women's rights.

""Did you see the part where we went into Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib's office?"" Greene said. ""I was like, so are you going to make me live under Sharia law? And I'm an American woman. Are you going to take away my equal rights?""

""They would in a heartbeat,"" responds another rally participant.

""Yeah,"" Greene responded. ""They all, all, all Muslims. That's the goal of Islam. The goal of Islam is Sharia, and they want to conquer. They want to conquer America and we're not going to do it.""

Greene directed anti-Muslim rhetoric at the American Muslim Women Political Action Committee in 2018.

""Wtf is their mission??? To make sure every women is dominated by Islam, is covered in sheets, loses our freedoms, and has to have our vaginas mutilated???,"" she wrote in 2018 on Facebook. Greene then liked a comment that the PAC was an ""invasion"" of our government. In another instance, Greene liked a comment saying ""We don't need gun control! We need Muslim control!""

In 2018, she liked a tweet from an account that pushes anti-Semitic conspiracies suggesting intelligence services for the nation of Israel killed President John F. Kennedy. In another post from 2018 , Greene wrote a theory that the deadly wildfires in California that year were caused by a laser from space, possibly controlled by the Rothschild investment bank. The Rothschilds are frequent targets of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

Greene has also called Soros, the Democratic donor and philanthropist, a ""Nazi"" and peddled a conspiracy that Soros is a Jew who ""turned in his own people over to the Nazis""; Soros is a Holocaust survivor.

This story has been updated to reflect the House's vote to remove Greene from her committee assignments."
Wisconsin governor issues new mask mandate an hour after Legislature repealed previous one,"(CNN) Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued a new public health emergency Thursday afternoon requiring face coverings in public, about an hour after the Republican-led state Assembly voted to repeal a previous coronavirus emergency order that included a mask mandate, according to a news release from his office.

""Every step of the way, our statewide strategies to contain this virus and prevent the spread have been met with lawsuits, political rhetoric and obstruction,"" Evers said in a video message announcing the new mask mandate. ""Unfortunately, that happened again today when Republicans in the Legislature came in to vote down our state's public health emergency and end requiring face coverings in public places.""

The Assembly voted 52-42 Thursday to repeal Evers' previous executive order, on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, according to online records from the Wisconsin State Legislature. Seven Republicans in the Assembly joined all Badger State Democrats in voting against the resolution after the same measure passed through the state Senate last week.

""Wearing a mask is the most basic thing we can do to keep each other safe,"" Evers said in the video. ""If the Legislature keeps playing politics and we don't keep wearing masks, we're going to see more preventable deaths, and it's going to take even longer to get our state and our economy back on track.""

Evers' move Thursday comes as daily new cases in the state have generally been decreasing over the past month but have still surpassed 1,000 a day recently, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering."
Chief of staff: White House hopes to revive Trump plan to mail masks to Americans,"(CNN) The Biden administration is hoping to resurrect a proposal from the Trump administration to mail face masks to every American in an attempt to stop the spread of Covid-19, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Thursday.

""This was an idea that really came up last year in the Trump administration -- the public health agencies recommended it, President Trump vetoed it for some reason,"" Klain told NBC's Lester Holt. ""We want to get this back on track. I hope in the next few days, or next week, we may be able to announce some progress on this.""

The US Postal Service had planned to distribute 650 million face coverings for the Trump administration last April, according to internal documents reviewed by CNN in September. A senior administration official told The Washington Post at the time that the plan was scrapped by the White House as some advisers were worried that it could create ""concern or panic.""

The Biden administration's professed amenability to the proposal comes after US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky appeared to cast doubt on whether sending Americans masks would necessarily convince those who did not already wear them to do so. When asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper last week if it made sense for the federal government to send masks to American households, she replied that ""it's not entirely clear to me that the reason people aren't wearing masks is because they don't have access to them.""

""Certainly, I would highly advocate for those in areas where they're under-resourced and they can't purchase masks or they don't have access to masks, we need to make sure that people have the protection,"" Walensky continued. 'But it's not entirely clear in my mind that the challenge of mask wearing has been one of access.""

Rochester mother of 9-year-old who was handcuffed and pepper-sprayed notifies city she intends to sue,"(CNN) The mother of a 9-year-old girl who was pepper-sprayed and handcuffed by Rochester police officers last month has notified the city and police department she intends to sue, CNN has learned.

A notice of claim states that the girl's mother, Elba Pope, will seek damages due to ""mental anguish and psychological/emotional distress and trauma"" and ""physical injury and substantial pain,"" as well as coverage for any future required medical treatment and mental health care.

Pope's daughter ran out of the house in distress because she ""was upset about her mother and step-father arguing,"" the notice, which CNN obtained from family attorney Lorenzo Napolitano, says.

Pope explicitly accused the officers of ""wanton, reckless and malicious"" conduct and is claiming ""negligence, violation of state and federal constitutional rights, infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, excessive force, false arrest, (and) false imprisonment,"" though she did not limit the scope of the claim to those allegations, the notice says.

Before a person files a lawsuit for damages against a city, New York law requires the plaintiff to prepare and serve a formal notice explaining the nature of the claim.

Pope claims in the notice that she tried to bring her daughter home, but that police ""intervened and stopped"" her. The notice states that police didn't tell Pope about the officers' use of pepper spray and handcuffing or the struggle her daughter had with police officers that was recorded by police body cameras

""No 9-year-old should be handcuffed. No 9-year-old should be pepper-sprayed. No one's humanity should be dismissed because of a badge. No human should be treated like this,"" Napolitano said in a statement. ""Reform is needed. Reform can come, but only if we are willing to listen to this little girl crying out for the protection that she didn't receive from the Rochester Police.""

One officer involved has been suspended and two were placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation, a Tuesday statement from Rochester Chief of Police Cynthia Herriott-Sullivan said. Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren condemned the incident on Monday, calling it ""simply horrible.""

CNN has reached out to the Rochester Police Department and the mayor for comment on the notice of claim.

Family trouble call

The officers responded to what police called a report of ""family trouble"" and the ensuing encounter has been sharply criticized by city and state officials. The incident has led to protests in the community.

Two body camera videos of the January 29 encounter show officers restraining the child, putting her in handcuffs and attempting to get her inside the back of a police vehicle as she repeatedly cries and calls for her father.

At one point, one officer says, ""You're acting like a child.""

""I am a child!"" the girl responds.

A female officer is seen talking to the girl later in the video, eventually saying, ""This is your last chance, otherwise pepper spray's going in your eyeballs."" About a minute later, another officer can be heard saying, ""Just spray her at this point."" The female officer is seen shaking a can that appears to be pepper spray and the child continues to scream.

The girl was transported to Rochester General Hospital and later released, according to police.

The incident has been compared to the death of Daniel Prude , a Black man who died in March after Rochester police pinned him to the ground and placed a hood over his head as he experienced a mental health crisis.

The police body camera footage of that incident, released in August after city officials intentionally delayed its release , led to protests over the police's treatment of Black people and those experiencing mental health crises. Warren later fired the police chief , saying there was a ""pervasive problem"" in the police department.

At a news conference Sunday, Herriott-Sullivan said the treatment of the girl was not acceptable.

""I'm not going to stand here and tell you that for a 9-year-old to have to be pepper-sprayed is OK. It's not,"" she said. ""I don't see that as who we are as a department, and we're going to do the work we have to do to ensure that these kinds of things don't happen.""

Warren said the girl reminded her of her own young daughter.

Monday, New York state Sen. Samra Brouk and Assemblyman Demond Meeks, both Democrats, introduced legislation that would prohibit police use of chemical agents against minors in the state, according to a statement.

""The harrowing experience endured by a nine-year-old girl in our community -- including being handcuffed and pepper sprayed -- should never happen to another child,"" Brouk said in a statement. ""This legislation will ensure that when a child is in crisis, they will never again be met with such violence in the form of pepper spray or other chemical irritants.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted Monday that her office is looking into the incident as well. She called the incident ""deeply disturbing and wholly unacceptable.""

Police have not identified the officers involved in the incident or the child.

CNN has not been able to verify with authorities or family members the race of the 9-year-old."
Prosecutors push to add third-degree murder charges against officers in George Floyd case,"(CNN) Prosecutors in Minnesota filed a motion Thursday asking a district court judge to reinstate a third-degree murder charge against former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin and add the same charge to the cases against three other former officers.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison claims a recent appellate decision in the sentencing of another former Minneapolis police officer ""is precedential and now provides this Court with clear guidance regarding the elements of third-degree murder.""

Chauvin is accused of second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd in May.

In October, Judge Peter Cahill dropped a third-degree murder charge against Chauvin ruling the charge can ""be sustained only in situations in which the defendant's actions were 'eminently dangerous to other persons' and were not specifically directed at the particular person whose death occurred.""

The evidence presented by the state did not show that Chauvin's actions were ""eminently dangerous"" to anyone but Floyd, the ruling said.

"Winter weather leads to 40-car pile-up in Iowa, people stranded by ice floes in Wisconsin","(CNN) Thursday brought havoc to the roads in Iowa and left dozens of people stranded by ice floes in Wisconsin, with a powerful winter storm showing no signs of abating in the Midwest.

Whiteout conditions along Interstate 80 west of Newton, Iowa, led to a 40-vehicle pileup there, the state patrol said Thursday afternoon.

Troopers, who weren't injured, were ""going vehicle to vehicle to check on occupants,"" the state patrol said on its Facebook page . There were a ""few serious injuries and several minor injuries,"" the post said.

Photos posted by the state patrol also showed tractor trailers turned on their side or jackknifed, along with other cars and trucks, including State Trooper cars.

In Door County, Wisconsin, 66 ice fishermen were rescued by the US Coast Guard on Thursday after they became stranded on an ice floe near Sturgeon Bay, according to a Facebook post from US Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City.

"San Quentin prison fined more than $400,000 after deadly Covid-19 outbreak","(CNN) San Quentin State Prison, where a deadly coronavirus outbreak was reported last summer, has been fined more than $400,000 by the California Department of Industrial Relation's Division of Occupational Safety and Health for workplace safety violations.

According to the notification of penalty issued Monday, the prison, California's oldest , failed to report coronavirus illnesses or deaths of employees.

Nearly 15 violations were issued and the prison was fined a total of $421,880, one of the highest penalties issued by the state for Covid-19 violations.

The fines come just days after the state's inspector general released a report saying the prison's ""deeply flawed"" detainee transfers contributed to the outbreak last summer.

""San Quentin State Prison has made many improvements and already remedied several of the citations in the eight months since Cal-OSHA visited the institution. The visits took place last June and July, and we have worked with Cal-OSHA representatives throughout the pandemic to ensure regulations were met and concerns addressed expeditiously,"" the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement.

The staff and inmates were provided with N-95 masks per public health recommendations, according to the statement. The department of corrections also made it a requirement for staff to wear masks in all 35 prisons.

San Quentin, just north of San Francisco, witnessed one of worst coronavirus outbreaks in California's prison system last summer.

When Covid-19 spread inside the California Institution for Men in Chino in May, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and California Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS) decided to transfer some detainees to facilities that were not experiencing outbreaks.

A total of 122 detainees were transferred to San Quentin on May 30, leading to a public health disaster, the inspector general's report said.

In the three months following the transfers, the number of Covid-19 cases soared to more than 2,200 among its approximately 3,300 inmates, and 28 detainees died of Covid-19 complications, according to the report.

Of the 122 detainees who had arrived from Chino, officials say, 91 tested positive and two died from Covid-19 complications.

""Our review found that the efforts by CCHCS and the department to prepare for and execute the transfers were deeply flawed and risked the health and lives of thousands of incarcerated persons and staff,"" the report stated.

The state's inspector general said officials ignored the concerns raised by health care staff before the transfers, including an email from a supervising nurse at the California Institution for Men asking whether detainees needed to be tested for the virus because some had not been tested for nearly a month.

Prison health care staff did conduct verbal and temperature screening on several detainees, the report says, but it was too early to determine whether they had Covid-19 symptoms when they boarded the buses that would take them to San Quentin and a smaller prison in Corcoran.

The report also indicates that the number of detainees on the buses was higher than the one previously recommended for social distancing, and that corrections officials failed to conduct contract tracing when some of the detainees who were transferred tested positive for the virus.

In a joint statement, the California Department of Corrections and the California Correctional Health Care Services acknowledged that ""some mistakes were made in the process of these transfers"" but there were many factors that contributed to the need for the transfers that were not reflected in the report.

The agencies said they have implemented several changes, including increased testing, isolation and quarantine spaces and the use of personal protective equipment.

Since those measures were implemented, the statement says, ""there have been no outbreaks attributed to institution transfers.""

""Our first and foremost priority is to ensure the health and safety of all who live and work in the state's prisons and surrounding communities. We will continue to work collaboratively with all stakeholders to ensure we are doing everything we can for the people in our care throughout and beyond the pandemic,"" the statement said.

In an interview, a detainee at San Quentin told CNN he feared he would die after getting sick with Covid-19 last year.

""As far as Covid-19 goes, this is a crime scene. This place should have like a spotlight and yellow tape wrapped around it,"" said Larry Jerome Williams.

""I wasn't sentenced to death -- I was sentenced to five years and four months,"" he added.

The number of coronavirus infections has since declined in San Quentin but has surged in other facilities in recent months as officials try to control the rampant spread across the state.

Since the pandemic started, there have been 47,826 cases and nearly 200 deaths reported in state facilities, according to state data. As of Thursday, there were 1,854 detainees in custody who tested positive for the virus."
Marjorie Taylor Greene has been stripped of her committee assignments. What's next?,"(CNN) The Democrat-led House of Representatives voted on Thursday to remove Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments, but that doesn't mean the backlash against her -- or the spotlight on her -- is at an end.

Greene, a freshman from Georgia, remains a member of Congress and will still be able to vote. But she has quickly become one of the most controversial lawmakers during her short time in office. That has elevated her profile in right-wing and conservative circles and given her more of a platform -- and some Democrats won't be satisfied that she's been sufficiently rebuked with the removal of her committee assignments alone.

Greene defended herself ahead of the vote in a speech on the House floor and attempted to distance herself from the dangerous and debunked QAnon conspiracy theory, which she has previously embraced.

But Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California, who has introduced a resolution to expel Greene, told reporters he still believes she should be removed from Congress even after watching her floor remarks. The congressman said of his resolution, ""I'm committed to bringing it up, and I said that to leadership that there needs to be a vote sooner rather or later on this.""

Gomez said that the reason why he is pursuing a resolution to expel Greene ""is to send a message that this kind of discourse in our politics is not acceptable, inciting political violence, threatening people as is not acceptable and a person like that should not hold a position in the House of Representatives."""
A man who was trying to get his SUV unstuck from a snowbank was killed when the vehicle caught fire,"(CNN) A man who was attempting to get his SUV out of a snowbank in New Jersey was killed after his vehicle caught fire, authorities said.

The Little Ferry Police Department said two officers responded to a call on Wednesday about a vehicle that was stuck in a snowed-over parking lot near Losen Slote Creek Park, about 14 miles from New York.

When they arrived, a 62-year-old man was repeatedly driving forward and reversing in an effort to extract his car from the snow, according to Little Ferry Police Capt. Ronald Klein.

After a brief conversation with the man, officers went to call for a tow truck and began to head back to their vehicles, Klein said. Soon, they heard a popping sound and saw smoke and flames coming from the SUV.

One officer tried to extinguish the fire while the other tried repeatedly to break in the windows and remove the driver, Klein said. Eventually, the officers were able to smash the rear passenger window. But by that point, the inside of the SUV was ""fully engulfed in flames,"" he said.

Leaders of the anti-vaccine movements used 'Stop the Steal' to crusade to advance their own conspiracy theories,"(CNN) As the Trump faithful gathered around the Capitol on January 6, two conspiracy theories peddling in government mistrust converged: The fraudulent belief that the election was stolen, and the dangerous narrative that Covid-19 vaccinations are wildly unsafe.

""We're being led off of a cliff,"" Del Bigtree, an anti-vaccine activist, told the crowd at the ""MAGA Freedom Rally D.C."" about a block from the Capitol.

""I wish I could tell you that Tony Fauci cares about your safety..."" he said. ""I wish I could believe that voting machines worked... but none of this is happening.""

In the wake of Trump's electoral defeat, some leaders of the anti-vaccine movement latched onto the ""Stop the Steal"" crusade, advancing their own conspiratorial claims and, in some cases, promoting private business ventures, CNN has found. Some prominent anti-vaxxers say they directly coordinated with organizers of the DC rallies in January and pushed their message at other MAGA demonstrations, and on pro-Trump podcasts and social media platforms.

The anti-vaccine message may have found a particularly receptive audience among some fervent Trump supporters, many of whom flout wearing masks and contend the lethality of the virus is overblown.

""It's marketing at a basic sales level,"" said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which has analyzed the strategies of anti-vaccine advocates. ""Conspiracism that allows you to connect anything together if you want to, because it doesn't require fact.""

Contrary to the statements of vaccine critics, the two vaccines authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration have been shown to be safe and effective.

But public health experts warn that anti-vaccine messages now pose a unique threat to the nation's health given the urgency for widespread coronavirus vaccination.

""One of our big concerns is that because people are seeing this anti-vaccine rhetoric we may not be able to reach levels of herd immunity we really need to stop virus proliferation,"" Tara C. Smith, an epidemiology professor at Kent State University, told CNN.

A national poll published this week from Monmouth University found 24% of people in the US will avoid getting the coronavirus vaccine if they can help it. The poll also found that willingness is driven more by political leanings than demographics.

The rally at the US Capitol featuring Bigtree, advertised as ""The MAGA Health Freedom Event of the Century,"" included other notable vaccine conspiracy theorists such as Mikki Willis, the filmmaker behind ""Plandemic,"" which falsely suggests Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was responsible for the creation of the coronavirus.

Del Bigtree, an anti-vaccine activist, speaks at ""MAGA Freedom Rally"" on January 6, 2021.

Bigtree, who says he's ""not anti-vaccine"" but rather ""pro-science"" and neither a Republican nor a Democrat, told CNN he did not speak at the rally to promote or benefit from ""Stop The Steal"" but rather to share his own message. ""Wherever there is an audience, I want to get the message across that our bodies are ours. We should be in control of what's injected into them,"" he said.

The event was organized in part by a political action committee run by Ty and Charlene Bollinger, a married couple who run websites and sell documentaries that claim to reveal ""the truth about vaccines"" and range in price from $199 to $499. They also market alternative health books and other products.

The Bollingers have engaged for years in what they describe as health-freedom activism. But in recent months they took up another cause.

In early November, they co-authored a post about ""voter fraud and election meddling"" for the website of political operative Roger Stone, who has taken credit for coining the phrase ""Stop the Steal"" to help then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016. Last November, Stone wrote in a webpost that he ""strategized"" with the Bollingers.

Blending conspiracy theories

On November 21, the Bollingers spoke at a ""Stop the Steal"" rally in Nashville and blended election conspiracy theories with claims that then President-elect Joe Biden planned to force vaccinations.

""There is no pandemic. It's all BS,"" Ty Bollinger told onlookers.

Ty and Charlene Bollinger sell documentaries that claim to reveal the ""truth about vaccines.""

In a video posted on January 4, Charlene Bollinger said she was working with other organizers on plans for the January 6th protests including ""Ali"" -- an apparent reference to Ali Alexander, a leader of the broader ""Stop the Steal"" movement.

Two days later, Charlene Bollinger introduced the speakers at her group's rally near the US Capitol, plugged her documentaries and blasted what she called, ""the forced Covid vaccine, such a scam."" She also told attendees that her husband Ty wasn't with her because he had gone to join the siege.

""I told him... they are storming the Capitol, and he looked at me and said, 'Do I need to stay here?' I knew he wanted to go. I said, 'Honey go,' so he did,"" she said.

Charlene Bollinger added that Ty texted her and said he was ""outside"" the Capitol. She then prayed ""for the patriots that are there now inside. They're trying to get inside that Capitol. Lord, use these people to eradicate this evil, these swamp creatures.""

The Bollingers did not respond to CNN's phone calls and emails that requested comment.

While outlandish claims of a stolen election may appear disjointed with vaccine fearmongering, their union at recent political rallies does not surprise Ahmed, of the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

Ahmed said fulltime anti-vaccine advocates often search for new audiences within other fringe movements with which they can build alliances. And he said it's not a coincidence that some of these professionals sell products like health supplements.

A July report by Ahmed's organization CCDH unpacked what it described as the ""Anti-Vaxx Industry."" The report noted that fulltime anti-vaccine campaigners expand their reach by appearing on conspiracy-theory-based YouTube channels and also lend their audiences to anti-vaccine entrepreneurs who seek to sell them products.

""What you're talking about is old fashioned snake-oil salesmen,"" Ahmed said.

Alex Jones and InfoWars

Another promoter of the stolen-election conspiracy theory is Alex Jones, who has long peddled falsehoods about vaccines and mainstream medicines on his show InfoWars. The show frequently advertises Jones' dietary supplements and survival products.

In April, the FDA warned Jones to take down a number of products marketed on his site as possible coronavirus treatments, such as ""Superblue Fluoride Free Toothpaste."" Those products no longer appear on his site.

Jones, who previously said a ""form of psychosis"" made him believe events like the Sandy Hook massacre were staged, has continued to promote other supplements next to segments on his show that stoke fears about coronavirus vaccines.

In recent months, he has woven in false allegations of widespread election meddling.

On January 3, Jones referenced ""pure evidence of election fraud"" just before a ""news"" alert about ""forced inoculations"" and other coronavirus claims. The video remains online next to an ad for ""DNA Force Plus"" supplements. The InfoWars Store includes a disclaimer that the products are ""not intended for use in the cure, treatment, prevention or mitigation of any disease...""

Jones also traveled to Washington and spoke at a pro-Trump rally on the eve of the Capitol siege. There, he blasted what he falsely described as the ""engineered virus that Bill Gates owns.""

InfoWars did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Spreading theories on social media

Other vaccine skeptics have promoted election conspiracy theories on social media.

Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a physician, supplement salesperson and author of the books such as ""Saying No To Vaccines,"" repeatedly promoted the January 6 Washington protests on Telegram. A January 5 post, for example, included a ""call to action"" and quoted the founder of the Oath Keepers extremist militant group as saying, ""Get to DC and STAND!"" Those posts were interspersed among her more usual anti-vaccine content.

Tenpenny also shared the ""Stop the Steal"" hashtag on Twitter in a quote tweet of a post about the DC rally from Dr. Simone Gold.

Gold, who founded the group America's Frontline Doctors, made headlines last summer for her appearance in a video that was later removed from social media for coronavirus misinformation. Trump retweeted the video, which also featured Stella Immanuel, who said in the past that DNA from space aliens is used in medicine.

Dr. Simone Gold speaks at pro-Trump rally on January 5, 2021.

On January 5, ""Stop the Steal"" organizer Ali Alexander introduced Gold at a Washington rally and reminded attendees that they weren't just fighting for the election but also against ""medical tyranny.""

Gold then took the stage and told the crowd, ""If you don't want to take an experimental biological agent deceptively named a vaccine, you must not allow yourself to be coerced!""

The next day, Gold and her colleague entered the Capitol building during the siege, according to an affidavit for a criminal complaint against her. She was later arrested, according to the Department of Justice.

America's Frontline Doctors told CNN in a statement that Gold is not a political organizer and ""did not participate in any incident that involved violence or vandalism and has categorically rebuked any such activity"" by others. The statement added that America's Frontline Doctors' physicians have recommended vaccines to patients but said the organization believes ""more study and greater transparency are needed with respect to COVID-19 vaccines.""

Since the riot, she has continued to spread her message.

""Definitely you should not be calling this the Covid-19 vaccines. The reason is, whatever you call it, it's experimental. It's not been approved as a vaccine,"" Gold said in a video posted January 14 that showed a talk she gave at a Tampa, Florida-based church led by a pastor who has appeared on Alex Jones' show.

Alex Jones, the founder of right-wing media group Infowars, addresses a crowd of pro-Trump protesters after they storm the grounds of the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.

While some audiences may have concerns after hearing anti-vaccine messages that reference actual instances of allergic reactions or other anecdotes, context is key, says Smith of Kent State University.

""You've had a handful of allergic reactions as compared to 4,000 people dying a day from actual coronavirus infection,"" she said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that severe allergic reactions to Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccines are rare.

Smith said that when anti-vaccine activists' claims about coronavirus vaccines are put in the larger context of scientific literature, ""all of those concerns are just dwarfed.""

While the momentum of the ""Stop the Steal"" movement may have died down, vaccine skeptics and far-right political groups will likely continue to trade audiences and ideas, which could translate into more public demonstrations, says Devin Burghart, executive director of the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights.

Burghart, who tracks far-right groups, said he has watched these two movements develop an increasing symbiotic relationship during the coronavirus pandemic.

""There is a larger constituency that is mobilized and they have adopted a far more destructive view of vaccines than they had before, and they have united with far-right paramilitaries and others,"" he said."
Opinion: Why astronomers are interested in this mysterious signal,"(CNN) In the 1997 movie ""Contact,"" a scientist, played by actress Jodie Foster, detects a radio signal -- the first communication from an extraterrestrial civilization. That story, penned by Carl Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan , is fiction of course. But the search for such a signal is not such a crazy story. Real scientists look to the sky, using powerful radio telescopes, hoping to hear even a faint whisper of a radio signal from of one our celestial neighbors.

And indeed, a recent report of a transmission originating from Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our own, was reported by the British newspaper The Guardian in December. The source of the story is not a scientific paper, but instead seems to have been leaked by an anonymous source. The claim of an intercepted signal, if it turns out to be truly sign of extraterrestrial intelligence, would be one of the most momentous discoveries of all times. But this reported signal is almost certainly not that.

In April and May of 2019, the 64-meter-wide Parkes radio telescope, located in Australia, was recording radio transmissions from the direction of nearby star Proxima Centauri. Over the course of hours, the telescope recorded data from the star for 30-minute intervals, before steering away to look at a different direction. This procedure, called "" nodding ,"" is used to establish that any observed signal is coming from a particular direction, rather than just random radio noise. For five of these half-hour intervals, the signal was observed while the antenna was pointing at Proxima Centauri, and it was not detected at all when it was aimed in another direction.

This signal was not immediately noticed; it was over a year after the data was recorded that Shane Smith, an intern with Breakthrough Listen, a project funded by billionaire Yuri Milner that seeks to find signals of extraterrestrial life, found it buried in the telescope's recordings. This was in late October 2020

So, what, exactly was seen? It was a radio signal at a single frequency, specifically 980.002 MHz. The signal drifted slightly with time, which is what you'd expect if it was emitted by a planet or moon orbiting a star. It was observed to have originated in a small patch of the sky, about half the diameter of the full moon , centered on Proxima Centauri.

First and foremost, it is important to note that astronomers think it is highly unlikely that the signal is caused by space aliens trying to communicate with us. Even the researchers involved in Breakthrough Listen do not make that claim.

It is also important to remember that this observation has not yet been published in a refereed journal, so it has not undergone rigorous scientific review. Instead, the internet buzz arose from a rumor of the signal that was leaked to The Guardian , which published it on December 18.

Still, it is interesting to do the thought experiment about whether the signal was really a communication from a civilization orbiting around a distant star. Proxima Centauri is our astronomical neighbor, just 4.2 light years away. It is a red dwarf star, so dim that it is not visible to the human eye. Proxima Centauri is known to have at least two planets. One is about seven times the mass of Earth, while the other is only about 20% more massive than Earth. The smaller planet orbits very close to the star, circling it in a mere 11 days

Proxima Centauri is dim compared to the Sun, and this smaller planet is located the right distance away from its star to possibly have liquid water. It is in what is called the Goldilocks zone -- not too hot, not too cold, but just right.

This makes the planet an exciting one for astronomers to study. A radio signal from a possibly habitable world could be the first proof that we are not alone in the universe. But we shouldn't be hasty. For one thing, the smaller planet orbiting Proxima Centauri is close enough to be affected by sudden bursts of energy called flares from the parent star. These flares would likely both bathe the planet with enough radiation to kill any familiar form of life and also strip away any possible atmosphere. The planet would also be "" tidally locked, "" with one face always facing the star, much like we see only one face of the Moon. It turns out that this planet is very unlikely to be a pleasant place.

In addition, it is simply much more likely that the radio signal is of terrestrial origin. We live in a world of radio signals, from AM and FM broadcasts of current music hits to cell phones and errant emissions from microwave ovens. And, with its frequency of 980.002 MHz, it's very curious that the signal frequency happens to be so close to an integer. If this is a signal from alien life, this would suggest it counts time in seconds the way we do. Plus, the signal is a single frequency. Radio transmissions need to vary in strength or frequency to transmit information, and this one doesn't, so if it is an alien trying to communicate, they're clearly not trying to tell us much.

So, sadly, it's likely that this potentially exciting signal has an ordinary cause. But that is quite beside the point. The important thing is that, whether it was generated by aliens or not, humanity detected the signal. We are gazing out into the cosmos, actively looking to see if we have cosmic neighbors. And that is good. It is something we should be doing.

One day, that scene acted out in ""Contact"" will be real. Some researcher will be surprised by a faint and scratchy signal from the sky -- a signal that will change everything. But only if we're listening. When ET does make that call, someone should be manning the phones."
Here are the 11 House Republicans who voted to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments,"Washington (CNN) Eleven House Republicans broke ranks Thursday evening to join Democrats in voting to remove Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments.

These lawmakers backed the effort following recently unearthed incendiary and violent past statements from Greene that have triggered widespread backlash:

House Democrats, who control the chamber, set up the vote after first attempting to pressure Republicans to strip the Georgia Republican of her committee assignments on their own.

House Republicans did not taken that action, however, and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California on Wednesday released a statement calling the push by Democrats to take away the congresswoman's committee assignments a ""partisan power grab."""
Biden and top Democrats split on how to cancel student debt,"Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren once again called on President Joe Biden to use executive authority to cancel student debt on Thursday -- but the President wants Congress to act first.

""The President has and continues to support canceling $10,000 of federal student loan debt per person as a response to the Covid crisis,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing. She added that that the President is ""calling on Congress to draft the proposal,"" and ""looks forward to signing it.""

In one of his first acts in office, Biden extended the pause on student loan payments and interest, a Covid relief benefit put in place by Congress last year that had already been renewed by the Trump administration. Federal student loan borrowers won't have to make payments until October 1 at the earliest.

But some Democratic lawmakers are hoping for more. Schumer and Warren, along with Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, led dozens of other Democrats in reintroducing a bicameral resolution Thursday that calls on Biden to cancel $50,000 per borrower -- something they argue that he has the executive power to do.

A similar resolution was introduced last year calling on the Trump administration to forgive student loan debt -- but former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos slammed that proposal as ""government gift giving."" House Democrats included a provision to cancel $10,000 per borrower in a sweeping Covid relief bill passed in May that was never taken up in the then Republican-led Senate.

Schumer said at a press conference earlier on Thursday that he and Warren had a 45-minute conversation with Biden and his advisers a few weeks ago to discuss canceling student debt. The Senate majority leader said he was optimistic that the administration would act if there's enough pressure from the American people.

""They have been extremely open to listening to us,"" he said.

Proposals go back to the Democratic primaries

Warren, as well as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have been pushing for some kind of student debt cancellation plan since 2019, when they were running in the Democratic presidential primary. Biden put out a policy proposal to forgive $10,000 per borrower only after the pandemic began and he was the presumptive nominee.

A broad cancellation of federal student loan debt would be unprecedented. But a memo from lawyers at Harvard's Legal Services Center and its Project on Predatory Student Lending says the Department of Education has the power to do so.

The Department already has some more targeted debt cancellation policies in place. It wipes away debt for defrauded students as well as disabled veterans. Biden could provide relief for hundreds of thousands of more borrowers just by expanding those programs, according to the National Student Legal Defense Network.

There are thousands of borrowers who say they were defrauded by now-defunct for-profit colleges like Corinthian and ITT Tech, but have waited years for the Education Department to review their claims as DeVos tried to roll-back an Obama-era rule that streamlined the process.

Warren says the economic crisis caused by the pandemic makes it even more important to cancel student loan debt as soon as possible, and argues that it would help narrow the racial wealth gap and jump start the economy by providing relief for more about 45 million Americans.

""Data show that canceling the student loan debt would result in greater home ownership rates, more housing stability, improved credit scores, higher incomes, higher GDP, more small business formation and more jobs,"" she said Thursday.

Economists say cancellation might not generate a big GDP boost

Some economists say that canceling student debt is not the best way to jump-start the economy right now. A Goldman Sachs analysis found that forgiving $10,000 of debt per borrower would likely cost $300 billion and add less than 0.1% to GDP, while forgiving up to $50,000 would cost around $800 billion and provide only a slightly bigger boost to GDP."
A trend that should worry Republicans,"(CNN) The reverberations of the January 6 riot at the US Capitol -- and the role then-President Donald Trump and his complicit allies in Congress played in it -- are still moving through both the electorate and the country as a whole.

But less than a month removed from the riot, there's a very troubling trend beginning to develop in states around the country: lots and lots of people are leaving the Republican Party.

Consider these numbers (as flagged by the invaluable and indefatigable Reid Wilson ):

* More than 10,000 registered Republicans in Arizona left the party in January -- almost five times the number of Democrats who left their side in that same time.

* In Utah, 7,600 Republicans have abandoned the party since January 6, according to The Salt Lake Tribune . By comparison, 830 left the Democratic Party."
A Utah theme park is suing Taylor Swift over 'Evermore' album title,"(CNN) Utah's Evermore Park has filed a federal lawsuit against Taylor Swift claiming the title of her latest album infringes on the theme park's trademarks.

The park is seeking millions of dollars in damages, according to court documents filed on Tuesday in the US District Court of Utah.

Swift released the ""Evermore"" album in December. It was her second album of 2020 and it went to number one on the Billboard Top 200 charts twice

Evermore Park is about a half-hour south of Salt Lake City and is based around the theme of a fantasy European village.

The lawsuit claims that the park and CEO Ken Bretschneider have invested approximately $37,000,000 in the creation and promotion of Evermore Park and the Evermore trademark.

US pharmacies could administer up to 100 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine a month. Here's how,"(CNN) Shipments of Covid-19 vaccines will be headed to pharmacies next week under a federal program that aims to get more people vaccinated quickly.

Twenty-one ""national pharmacy partners and networks of independent pharmacies representing over 40,000 pharmacy locations nationwide"" are taking part in the program, according to a government fact sheet , which includes a list of all participating pharmacies or networks.

In phase one of the distribution plan, 1 million doses will be sent out to about 6,500 stores including Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Publix pharmacies, and others, starting on February 11.

Many pharmacies already vaccinate people against a number of illnesses, including the flu and shingles. Some experts have suggested that pharmacies nationwide will have the capacity to administer 100 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine once supply is available.

""Based on conservative assumptions, pharmacies have the capacity to meet the demand for 100 million vaccine doses in one month when that level of the vaccine supply is available,"" Steven Anderson, president and CEO of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, told reporters last month

Pharmacies are also ""readily accessible in most communities, with most Americans living within five miles of a pharmacy,"" White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said earlier this week.

Here's a look at how the plan will work.

Phase one will include only some pharmacies in certain states

The pharmacies that will have the vaccine are selected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and states, taking into account ""their ability to reach some of the populations most at risk for severe illness from Covid-19, including socially vulnerable communities,"" according to Zients.

""In the early phase, many pharmacies across the country will not have vaccine, or may have very limited supply,"" Zients said Tuesday.

CVS and Walgreens will be getting a large share of the first shipment of vaccinations.

Starting Thursday , CVS said it will be offering doses to people eligible in some of its stores in 11 states , including California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.

CVS will have about a quarter of the total initial million doses.

Walgreens said it will begin offering vaccines on February 12 in 15 states , including Chicago and other places in Illinois, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, including New York City, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Vermont, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

Not every CVS or Walgreens pharmacy in these states will have the vaccine in this initial phase.

However, ""as more supply becomes available the company will expand to additional states while increasing the number of stores offering vaccinations,"" CVS said in a news release.

Walmart will be offering the vaccine in some of its stores in Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Louisiana and Wyoming.

""Once a store or club receives allocation, our online scheduler will be available to make appointments,"" Walmart said in a statement.

Walmart said last month that it expects it will be able to administer 10 million to 13 million doses per month ""when supply and allocations allow"" across its more than 5,000 pharmacies in the United States and Puerto Rico.

CVS has said it eventually expects to be able to administer as many as 20 million to 25 million shots per month across its nearly 10,000 stores.

You must be eligible to get a vaccine before booking an appointment

The pharmacies in the program will follow the state's guidelines and only vaccinate people who are eligible in that state.

Most states have followed the CDC's recommendation and are offering vaccines to frontline workers and the elderly in long-term care facilities right now.

States like Florida and Georgia are also offering vaccines to people 65 and older.

Those who are eligible will be able to sign up for an appointment.

Appointments can be made online or by phone

Experts are hopeful that vaccination appointments will eliminate wait times for clients, and make the process similar to getting a flu vaccination at your local drug store.

There is normally a 15-minute wait time after getting the Covid-19 shot, which is in place to make sure people don't have an allergic reaction.

Appointments can be made online or by phone.

At Walgreens, appointments can be booked through a vaccine scheduler . The CVS website lets you search by state

Requiring everyone to have an appointment will also help stores make sure people are socially distanced and that there's no crowding.

""Vaccines are by appointment, so we know how many people will need to be observed,"" a Walmart spokesperson told CNN in an email.

In locations where Walmart will host vaccination clinics, it will have floor decals to mark social distancing. Stores will also space out chairs so people are socially distant.

Everyone will be able to get the vaccine at no cost, even people who have no health insurance or are under-insured.

Challenges include supply and staffing

Vaccine supply at this stage is the main challenge. There will only be 1 million doses sent to drug stores at first, and it's not clear if or when the allocation to drug stores will be increased.

That will ramp up over time, as more supply becomes available.

CVS has hired around 10,000 pharmacy technicians to administer vaccines and coronavirus testing, Michael DeAngelis, a CVS spokesman, said. It plans to have around 90,000 employees, including pharmacists, licensed pharmacy technicians and nurses, administering vaccines.

Walmart has not put a number on how many pharmacy staff members it will need to add for vaccine administering. But it is offering current staff a bonus for referring qualified candidates, a Walmart spokesperson told CNN in an email.

Supply constraints and a patchwork system of vaccine eligibility by states are not the only challenges facing these chains and their staff.

The pharmacy chains are also preparing for misinformation online about the vaccine as well.

Giant Eagle, which has more than 400 stores in five states, has prepared talking points for its more than 600 pharmacists who will administer the vaccine. The goal is to help combat false information about the virus, Victor Vercammen, chief pandemic officer at the chain, said in an interview last month.

""We are also doing our best to educate the public ... to help them sift through what might be on social media, what might be factual, what might be opinion, around topics like Covid vaccine safety,"" he said.

Pharmacies are ready, trade group says

Once the supply of vaccine is available, pharmacies around the country could be vaccinating seven people an hour and 100 million a month, even with current staffing, according to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.

The group's model assumes that 40,000 chain pharmacies, including traditional drug stores like CVS and Walgreens, grocery stores like Kroger and large retailers such as Walmart and Costco, can administer 3.3 million vaccinations per day.

The model does not include independent pharmacies in the United States that will also administer the vaccine and are part of the federal partnership.

If all of the nearly 17,000 independent pharmacies that give immunizations had the vaccine, they could administer approximately 1.28 million per day, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association."
Opinion: The children the pandemic is threatening,"René Marsh is a CNN national correspondent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) The new year has seen a continuation of the Covid-19 tragedy: a record number of deaths in January and now the emerging threat of more contagious variants of the virus.

I think about what's unraveling in the world outside while I sit in the hospital room that my 22-month-old son and I have called ""home"" for about six months. As a mother who is watching her toddler fight brain cancer, I have had to confront a sad realization. Vulnerable children, like the ones I see here on the pediatric oncology floor every day, may become collateral damage of this pandemic without ever contracting the virus.

Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, cancer has not disappeared. Children are being diagnosed every day and some parents are receiving the devastating news that their child's cancer has returned. For six months, MRI scans assured me and my husband that our son was in remission. He even rang the bell symbolizing his last chemo treatment. But in November we were blindsided -- the cancer was back, and it had spread.

This news had come after two cycles of chemo in the hospital, a cocktail of five potent chemotherapy drugs, one of which his doctors suspect nearly killed him. The toxicity from the drug caused him to go into cardiac arrest. He was on life support for six days before being put on a daily, low-dose, at-home regimen of six chemo drugs for six months.

Pediatric cancer is a white-knuckle journey. The mountains we climb and the valleys we visit as parents of these little warriors fighting this terrible disease illustrate the inadequacies in the treatments and knowledge about these cancers -- and Covid- 19 only exacerbates that. The need for new, more effective and less toxic drugs is urgent. To have a child with cancer is the deepest pain and torture any person can endure. But I believe collectively as a nation we can and should want to spare others from this pain. We can start by finding a worthy pediatric cancer organization to donate to this World Cancer Day on February 4.

Democrats make new push for college athlete compensation,"(CNN) Another effort aimed at ensuring college athletes make money off their names, images and likenesses was introduced by Democratic lawmakers on Thursday.

It is similar to the push for college athlete compensation in the "" College Athlete Bill of Rights ,"" a bill led by Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, and supported by Murphy that was introduced in the Senate in December. But if enacted, the NIL legislation would give college athletes more control over the use of their NIL and provide a framework for prospective college athletes to also get compensated for their names, images and likenesses.

College athletes would be able to ""market the use of their name, image, likeness, or athletic reputation individually and as a group"" because the bill would prohibit the National Collegiate Athletic Association, colleges and conferences from creating rules that restrict how current and prospective athletes use their NIL.

Colleges and conferences would also be prevented from regulating the ""legal, financial, or agency representation of college athletes and prospective college athletes with respect to the marketing of their names, images, likenesses, or athletic reputations, including the certification of such legal, financial, or agency representation,"" the text of the bill reads.

It calls for equitable opportunities for college athletes to market their NIL by directing the NCAA, colleges and conferences to make ""support accessible to all college athletes in the applicable athletic program, regardless of gender, race, or participating sport.""

The bill would also prohibit colleges, conferences and the NCAA from preventing college athletes from forming ""a collective representative to facilitate group licensing agreements or provide representation for college athletes,"" a move that would allow athletes' NIL to be featured in video games and used on apparel.

Trahan, who received a scholarship to play women's volleyball at Georgetown University, said in a statement Thursday that the NCAA's business model for decades ""has utilized the guise of amateurism to justify obscene profitability while student athletes have struggled to get by.""

""As leaders at the NCAA finally come to grips with the need for change, it's important that Congress enact reforms to establish and protect student-athletes' right to be compensated for the use of their name, image, likeness, or athletic association,"" she said.

Murphy echoed Trahan on Thursday and said, ""It's time for us to stop denying the right of college athletes to make money off their talents.""

Donald Remy, the NCAA's chief legal officer, told CNN on Thursday that the association ""will work with all interested members of Congress to help advance our shared interest to assure the American tradition of college athletics thrives in the 21st century and athletes are successful on the field, in the classroom and in life.""

""The NCAA remains committed to modernizing its rules to enhance the college athlete experience, including allowing name, image and likeness opportunities similar to scenarios available to other students on campus,"" Remy said in a statement.

Golden State Warriors player Draymond Green, who is a CNN contributor, applauded the new legislation as ""game-changing for the players.""

""Covid-19 has proven how college athletes are anything but amateur. College sports generates $15 billion every year for everyone except the athletes actually playing the game. It's slave labor in a downright dictatorship,"" Green said Thursday. ""I've seen firsthand just how backwards the NCAA's likeness restrictions for college athletes are and how myself and my teammates struggled to make ends meet.""

A jump through hoops on college athlete compensation

Multiple bills have been introduced in Congress since 2019 to address college athlete compensation but didn't pass, including Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio's ""Fairness in Collegiate Athletics Act,"" which called for the NCAA to implement rules for college athletes to be compensated by third parties for their names, images and likenesses by June 30, 2021. Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, an Ohio Republican who's a former NFL player, along with Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat, also introduced bipartisan legislation aiming to compensate college athletes.

In October 2019, the NCAA Board of Governors voted to allow college athletes to be paid for the use of their names, images and likenesses once its three divisions -- Division I, Division II and Division III -- decide on the rules for the opportunities.

And the Supreme Court agreed in December to hear an appeal by the NCAA of a lower court ruling that allowed colleges to compensate athletes for education-related expenses, though the justices haven't yet heard arguments in the case.

The NCAA has argued that additional compensation beyond scholarships blurs the line between college and professional sports. The association also said its rules are necessary to maintain the tradition of amateurism in college sports."
Two Google employees quit over AI researcher Timnit Gebru's exit,"(CNN Business) Two Google engineers have resigned from the tech giant, citing the departure late last year of prominent Black artificial intelligence researcher Timnit Gebru. The resignations are the latest salvos in an ongoing fight between the company and workers who are furious about its lack of diversity.

Wednesday that he left Google this month ""because of Google's mistreatment"" of Gebru and April Curley, a Black ex-Google diversity recruiter who in December In a letter posted to LinkedIn dated January 5, David W. Baker, a Google director of engineering who worked on trust and safety, wrote that he was leaving the company as of January 19 after more than 16 years. Gebru's departure, Baker wrote, ""extinguished my desire to continue as a Googler."" Similarly, Vinesh Kannan, a software engineer, posted on TwitterWednesday that he left Google this month ""because of Google's mistreatment"" of Gebru and April Curley, a Black ex-Google diversity recruiter who in December tweeted that she had been fired after experiencing retaliation due to her repeatedly advocating for the company to hire qualified Black college graduates.

Kannan did not respond to a request for comment. In an interview with CNN Business, Baker said he reached a point of exhaustion in trying to improve the company's culture.

""Someone as amazing as Timnit should be working at Google. It's important she should be there,"" he said. ""And Google failed to keep her employed, period.""

"$1.7 billion Ponzi scheme defrauded 17,000 investors, SEC says","(CNN Business) The US Securities and Exchange Commission charged investment adviser GPB Capital Holdings and three executives on Thursday with defrauding over 17,000 retail investors in a Ponzi-like scheme that raised over $1.7 billion.

The lawsuit alleges that David Gentile, owner and CEO, Jeffry Schneider, owner of GPB Capital's placement agent Ascendant Capital, and Jeffrey Lash, GPB Capital's former managing partner, used investors' own funds to pay out monthly distributions to investors instead of putting them toward customers' investments. GBP Capital was also charged with violating whistleblower protection laws.

The investors were told their 8% monthly distributions would be fully covered by profits of the portfolio's companies, despite the executives knowing about its shortfalls. But in reality, the investors were at least partially paid with funds from new investors.

The defendants allegedly falsified financial statements and created back-dated performance guarantees to show an income that did not exist.

GPB claims it has acted in good faith while managing investors' funds.

10 GOP senators respond to White House but underscore deep divide on Covid-19 relief package,"(CNN) The 10 Senate Republicans who met with President Joe Biden this week on his coronavirus relief package sent a detailed letter to the White House laying out a series of concerns about the proposal, according to a letter obtained by CNN.

While both sides praised the nearly two-hour meeting in the Oval Office this week, the deep divergence between Biden's $1.9 trillion the $618 billion GOP proposal persists. Still the Republican group is using the letter to push for talks to continue.

""We remain committed to working in a bipartisan fashion and hope that you will take into account our views as the legislative process moves forward,"" the group, led by Maine Sen. Susan Collins, said in the letter sent Thursday to Biden.

The letter underscores just how far apart the White House and the Senate GOP group remain on the policy and marks the first time Republicans have contacted the White House since the meeting. The White House, at Biden's request, sent memos to the group on Tuesday. Those memos, obtained by CNN , detail a defense of Biden's proposal on areas like school funding and direct payments

But where the White House laid out details about the importance and need for the scale and longer-term investments in their proposal, the Republican response goes into detail about the amount of funds from past relief bill that remain unspent and pressed for more detail on the justification on several specific elements of the overall plan.

Federal spending on food aid up 50% but hungry Americans say it's not enough,"(CNN) The Department of Agriculture spent nearly 50% more in 2020 than it did pre-pandemic to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP -- a figure that underlines the lifeline it provides to Americans struggling with hunger.

Spending ballooned to $90 billion last year as the program expanded from an average of 35.7 million recipients in fiscal 2019 to an average of 39.9 million in the last fiscal year, according to USDA. In December, Congress approved a 15% increase in benefits for six months, and both President Joe Biden and Senate Republicans have proposed extending those benefits through September as well as increasing funding for supplemental nutrition assistance to women, infants and children.

""We worry we're not reaching everyone who needs our help, but absolutely the program has grown dramatically,"" said Stacy Dean, deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at USDA.

The new Biden administration is reviewing programs and looking to expand assistance, a turnaround from the Trump administration, which tried to tighten eligibility but was blocked by a federal judge amid the pandemic last year.

""Many experts and, more fundamentally, the families who use it are worried that it just isn't enough, and that it doesn't reflect the cost of a basic healthy diet,"" Dean said. ""So we're actually taking a look at that now to see if adjustments are needed to make it so that families can afford a basic diet with our benefits.""

Food banks report seeing first-timers

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is just that -- a supplement. The program is designed to boost food budgets for families who live below the poverty line. But historic unemployment has left many more families struggling as the pandemic continues to surge.

On a recent Wednesday morning, about 1,000 cars packed the parking lot at a food distribution center run by the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. The organization and its partners are serving 900,000 residents a month -- almost a tenth of the population of Los Angeles County.

""Over 40% of those coming through are new to need. This is the first time they've sought food assistance from any type of program,"" said Michael Flood, the food bank's president and CEO.

He said many clients aren't aware of federal benefit programs. ""So we have information in the food boxes, letting them know how to apply,"" he added.

'The difference between life and death'

Veronica Bedico, a single mother of four, has been off and on SNAP for several years. She had been employed part time as a school aide but was furloughed in March. She now relies on food stamps more than ever.

""It may literally mean the difference between life and death. And that is not an abstract thing,"" said Bedico. ""It is quite literally the only way me, and others like me, have been able to survive without having any family support during this time.""

Bedico receives both SNAP and money from the Pandemic EBT program, but she still needs to make monthly visits to the Foothill Unity Center, a food pantry in Monrovia, California.

""All of those things have allowed us to survive, and not starve,"" said Bedico.

Making it easier to get help

USDA says it is trying to make assistance programs more accessible by encouraging more sign-ups over the phone and online instead of in person.

""If you're a working mom, coming in to a midday appointment in a WIC clinic might be hard for you, but maybe you could do an appointment over your mobile phone,"" said Dean. ""We want to try to flip it and be responsive to the needs of families who just need some basic help.""

That also includes expanding on the SNAP Online Purchasing pilot, which allows SNAP recipients to purchase groceries online instead of going in person to the grocery store. Forty-seven states have signed on to the program, which launched in April 2019 and now covers more than 97% of SNAP participants. Under the Biden administration the USDA hopes to sign up more stores that will both accept online SNAP orders and provide delivery.

Still not enough

Kenya Edwards signed up for SNAP but says it's not enough. It's why she was in line at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.

""I get like $200,"" said Edwards. ""I can make it stretch, but once it's gone it's gone.""

The lines in Los Angeles repeat throughout the country. In Georgia, 1 in 7 adults and 1 in 5 children are now food insecure, according to the Atlanta Community Food Bank.

In New York, Public Health Solutions, which helps New Yorkers sign up for SNAP, says it's seen a fivefold increase.

""This is a bit of a stopgap,"" said Lisa David, president and CEO of Public Health Solutions. ""It's better than nothing, but it's not helping people feel confident that they can put food on the table for their families every day.""

UPDATE: An earlier version of this story cited a USDA figure on the number of SNAP recipients for the last fiscal year that has since been revised."
Johnson & Johnson asks FDA to authorize its Covid-19 vaccine,"(CNN) Johnson & Johnson officially asked the US Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine Thursday, taking forward the possibility of a third coronavirus vaccine for the US market.

""Today's submission for Emergency Use Authorization of our investigational single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is a pivotal step toward reducing the burden of disease for people globally and putting an end to the pandemic,"" Dr. Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer at Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement.

The FDA has scheduled a public meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for Feb. 26. The independent group of experts will look at the data and make a recommendation that the agency takes into consideration when it makes a decision.

This means an EUA will not come before the end of the month, if the FDA decides to grant one. But adding a third vaccine to the mix would add both supply and flexibility to the struggling US efforts to vaccinate the population.

If the FDA decides to authorize the vaccine, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet to discuss whether the vaccine should be given to Americans and if so, who should get it first.

"Breast cancer tops lung cancer as most diagnosed cancer in the world, new study says","(CNN) Breast cancer in women has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, according to a new report.

The paper, published in the CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians on Thursday, estimates that there were about 2.3 million new cases of female breast cancer last year, making up 11.7% of all new cancer cases. Meanwhile, lung cancer made up 11.4% of total cases diagnosed, according to the new report.

Until now, lung cancer had been the most diagnosed in previous reports covering the last two decades, said Hyuna Sung, principal scientist and cancer epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society, who was an author of the paper.

""The change of the rank signals the epidemiologic transition of cancers,"" Sung told CNN. ""That was quite surprising news for us.""

Breast cancer leads in cases, lung cancer leads in deaths

There were 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer and 2.2 million new cases of lung cancer in 2020, according to the new report.

In 2018, the most recent year with available data , lung cancer was in the lead -- there were 2,088,849 new cases of breast cancer and 2,093,876 new cases of lung cancer at that time.

Sung said in an email to CNN on Thursday that there has been an increase in breast cancer awareness, but mammogram screenings may not explain the full rise of beast cancer diagnoses over time.

""The increasing trend of breast cancer is likely to reflect the increase in the prevalence of breast cancer risk factors such as excess body weight, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, postponement of childbearing, fewer childbirths, and less breastfeeding,"" Sung said.

Researchers from the American Cancer Society in Atlanta and the International Agency for Research on Cancer in France wrote in the report that lung cancer still ranked as the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women combined, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths, making up 18% of all cancer deaths.

Lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths among men, making up 21.5% of men's cancer deaths. Whereas, breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer death among women at 15.5%.

'The burden of cancer ... is rapidly growing worldwide'

The report is based on cancer incidence and mortality data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Overall, the data suggest that there were an estimated 19.3 million new cases and 10 million cancer deaths worldwide in 2020.

The five most commonly diagnosed cancers, according to the report, were: female breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and stomach cancers.

The five leading causes of cancer death, the data showed, were: lung, colorectal, liver, stomach and female breast cancer.

These estimates do not reflect the potential impact that Covid-19 could have had on cancer diagnoses or deaths since the estimates draw from extrapolations of cancer data from previous years.

""Nobody knows the full extent of the impact of the pandemic on cancer statistics yet,"" Sung said. ""But there are many studies that suggest we are already seeing delays in diagnosis and treatment.""

Looking ahead, the new report estimates that the global burden of cancer is projected to reach 28.4 million cases in 2040 -- marking a 47% rise from last year.

In the past two decades, according to the World Health Organization , the number of people diagnosed with cancer climbed from an estimated 10 million in 2000 to 19.3 million in 2020.

Now, about 1 in 5 people worldwide will develop cancer during their lifetime, the WHO noted.

""The burden of cancer incidence and mortality is rapidly growing worldwide, and reflects both aging and growth of the population, as well as changes in the prevalence and distribution of the main risk factors for cancer, several of which are associated with socioeconomic development,"" Freddie Bray, senior author of the report and head of the section of cancer surveillance at the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said in a news release.

""Effective and resource-sensitive preventative and curative interventions are pertinent for cancer diagnosis,"" Bray said. ""Tailored integration into health planning can serve to reduce the global burden of cancer and narrow the evident cancer inequities between transitioning and transitioned countries observed today."""
What is the Defense Production Act (and what does it mean for Covid vaccines)?,"Washington (CNN) The Biden administration has repeatedly floated plans to ramp up Covid-19 vaccine production through the Defense Production Act, which was passed in 1950 in response to the Korean War.

""It was invoked, and it means our work is ongoing with companies to ensure that we are expediting the manufacturing of materials to ensure that we can get 100 million shots in the arms of Americans,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week.

While the new administration has yet to announce any specific deals to ramp up supplies related to Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing or distribution, pressure to utilize the broad authority of the Defense Production Act has mounted alongside concerns about the slow rollout and the risks posed by new coronavirus variants

Here's what the law does and what it might mean moving forward:

Three quarters of Republicans believe a lie about the 2020 election,"(CNN) Donald Trump spent the three months between the November election and the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president insisting -- via public pronouncement and tweet -- that the 2020 race had been stolen from him.

Despite the fact that he never provided ANY evidence to back up that claim -- and the fact that courts across the country roundly rejected lawsuits on the matter as specious (at best) -- Trump quite clearly convinced lots and lots of Republicans of his false view.

How many? Try 76% of self-identified Republicans in a new national Quinnipiac University poll. That's the number of Republicans who said they believe there was ""widespread fraud in the 2020 election.""

Yes, you read that right. Three in every four Republicans in the poll agreed with the idea that there was ""widespread"" wrongdoing in last November's election.

And it's not just Republicans. More than one in three political independents said the same in the Quinnipiac poll. Heck, 4% of Democrats agreed! (Overall, 36% said there was widespread fraud in the election while 59% said there was not.)

GOP base rewards Trump loyalists with campaign cash and media appearances,"(CNN) The Republicans who have remained aligned with former President Donald Trump have become lightning rods in Washington -- but are being rewarded with fundraising surges from Republican small-dollar donors and bookings on right-wing media outlets who could steer the party's future.

Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene have both said in recent days they have seen a fundraising influx, highlighting the financial incentive to closely embracing Trump and underscoring the former president's ongoing hold on the party even out of office.

The divisions between Republicans who want to move past the Trump era and its deadly ending and those who continue to fully embrace the former president -- including his conspiracy-minded allies and the more damaging elements he unleashed -- is poised to play out in the party's primaries ahead of the 2021 elections and the 2022 midterms, and could also set the tone for the earliest stages of the 2024 primary as potential candidates begin to position themselves.

Hawley -- who drew the ire of then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans when he objected to the electoral votes of several swing states on January 6, even after the riot by Trump supporters at the US Capitol -- raised nearly $1 million in January, his pollster Wes Anderson said in a memo.

Anderson argued that the corporations, including Kansas City-based Hallmark and Cerner Corp. and St. Louis-based utility Ameren Corp. and financial firm Edward Jones, and major Republican donors who have since halted political donations entirely or said they won't financially back the Republicans who voted to overturn the election results were made up for by the GOP's small-dollar donors, who still overwhelmingly support Trump.

Rihanna's call to support Indian farmers quickly embraced by other celebrities,"(CNN) Rihanna's advocacy for farmers in India has caught the attention of many around the world, including the Indian government.

On Tuesday, the Barbados-born superstar asked her 100 million followers, ""Why aren't we talking about this?!"" and linked to a CNN story examining how India has cut off internet access around New Delhi after violent clashes between police and farmers protesting new agriculture laws approved in September

Farmers argue that the laws will ravage their livelihoods and create an opportunity for large, private companies to exploit the agriculture sector.

The internet restrictions came ""in the interest of maintaining public safety and averting public emergency,"" according to the Ministry of Home Affairs, after weekend violence saw dozens of officers injured and one protester killed, according to police officials

More than half of India's working population comes from the agricultural sector, according to India's most recent Census in 2011. The laws could affect millions of Indian farmers and consumers, and they could also impact global consumers who rely on India for ingredients like pepper, turmeric and chilli.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the new laws will give farmers a chance to decide their own prices and sell directly to private businesses like grocery chains. That, he says, would cut out the middle man, in this case the Agricultural Produce Market Committee.

Farmers argue the new laws will help big companies drive down prices. They say that while farmers could sell crops at higher prices if the demand is there, they could struggle with lower prices in years when there is too much supply in the market.

India's Supreme Court has put the farm laws on hold until further notice.

The tweet heard around the world

A couple of hours after Rihanna's message, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen known for her climate activism, said via Twitter that she stood ""in solidarity with the #FarmersProtests in India.""

More celebrities and athletes have followed suit.

Los Angeles Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma echoed Rihanna on Twitter, saying, ""We should be talking about this!"" And Juju Smith-Schuster , a wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers, showed his support by donating $10,000 to provide medical assistance to farmers in need.

The Indian government seemed to take notice of the celebrity attention surrounding the protests and issued a statement criticizing those coming to the aid of farmers online.

""Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken,"" Anurag Srivastava, a spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""The temptation of the sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible.""

Several Bollywood celebrities like Akshay Kumar Karan Johar and Suneil Shetty have defended the Indian government. Kumar asked people to ""support an amicable resolution, rather than paying attention to anyone creating difference,"" and Shetty asked people to ""take a comprehensive view of things, as there is nothing more dangerous than half truth."""
Horse tranquilizer is hitting the US as a dangerous street drug,"(CNN) A new and dangerous street drug is emerging in the US.

It's called xylazine, though it's better known by its street name, ""tranq"". It's a non-opioid sedative used in veterinary medicine, typically with horses.

And in Philadelphia, where drug overdoses have spiked to historic highs , it was present in nearly one-third of all fatal opioid overdose cases in 2019.

A new study in the journal Injury Prevention , published Wednesday, suggests the opioid epidemic in the US continues to evolve.

Xylazine is not for humans

Different from ketamine, an animal tranquilizer also used -- effectively -- in human medicine, xylazine has not been approved by the FDA for human use.

In humans, the study said, xylazine may depress the central nervous and respiratory systems, and cause low blood pressure and a slow heart rate.

When it's combined with opioids to create ""tranq dope,"" it may be deadly.

'Tranq' use is spiking in Philadelphia

Philadelphia has been in the throes of a worsening opioid crisis in recent years, slightly relieved by the life-saving overdose reversal drug, naloxone

But naxolone is ineffective for xylazine poisoning, because xylazine is not an opioid.

Between 2010-2015, xylazine was only detected in 2% of heroin and/or fentanyl overdose deaths in Philadelphia.

In 2019, that proportion jumped to 31%.

The reasons for its spike over the past decade aren't yet clear, Jewell Johnson, MPH, substance abuse epidemiologist at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and lead author on the study, told CNN.

But, she said, one reason xylazine use is surging so quickly may be because of its powerful sedative effects.

""We have heard in focus groups with people who use drugs in Philadelphia that 'tranq dope makes you feel like you're doing dope [heroin] in the old days [before it was replaced by fentanyl],'"" she said.

According to the study, fentanyl has largely eclipsed heroin's place in Philadelphia's illicit drug market.

The study said a combination approach for overdoses involving both xylazine and opioids -- or ""tranq dope"" -- may include naloxone with other measures, like intubation and ventilation.

It's involved in overdoses in other states

Philadelphia isn't the only US city to find a rise of xylazine in toxicology reports.

Johnson said jurisdictions in Ohio and Maryland have also detected xylazine in opioid overdose deaths in recent years.

In Frederick County, Maryland, xylazine remained largely a mystery until October 2020

""We started seeing clients that had necrotic tissue damage and severe abscesses ... related to both injection use and snorting,"" Andrea Walker, director of Behavioral Health Services for the Frederick County Health Department in Maryland, told CNN.

""We started hearing reports from the people who were using these substances -- about really distressing side effects, such as periods of extended blackout,"" she said. ""They were losing hours of time.""

After obtaining and testing substance samples, Walker said xylazine was being used as a cutting agent for fentanyl, heroin and cocaine.

She confirmed that xylazine is still present in Frederick County, and was detected in a sample as recently as Dec. 29.

What we know and where it's headed

While xylazine is newly emerging in the continental US, it has been a drug of abuse in Puerto Rico since the early 2000s, the study said.

different study published in 2012 found that the prevalence of xylazine use among drug users sampled in the San Juan metropolitan area was 80.7%.

Xylazine's trajectory in Philadelphia and elsewhere remains to be seen.

Now, the study calls on jurisdictions who don't test for xylazine in toxicology reports to include it. Researchers are also pushing for more education about the drug.

""Public efforts should be focused on informing people who use drugs that their drug supply may have been adulterated with xylazine, and warn them about the adverse effects,"" Johnson said.

More research is needed, she said, to understand the health consequences of xylazine use in combination with other drugs."
Super Bowl LV will be a bonanza for gambling companies,"New York (CNN Business) The Kansas City Chiefs or Tampa Bay Buccaneers? We don't know who will win Super Bowl LV. But the big sports betting and fantasy firms are already champs.

This is the third Super Bowl since the Supreme Court legalized sports betting at the state level in 2018. Several states have since approved measures allowing bets to be placed at physical locations (known as sportsbooks) as well as through online wagering. That means 2021 could be the best year yet for the gambling giants.

DraftKings isn't the only firm to cash in on the wave of legalized sports betting around the United States.

Shares of UK-based, owner of DraftKings rival FanDuel , are up about 75% in the past year. Casino owner, which bought a big stake in Barstool Sports last year, has soared about 280% since February 2020.

""Demand is off the charts,"" said FanDuel CEO Matt King in an interview with CNN Business Thursday. ""This will be biggest event in the company's history.""

Football fans in more than two dozen states and Washington, DC now have the ability to legally bet on sports online, via mobile apps or in person at licensed sportsbooks.

""The most significant change is the growth of our available customers,"" said DraftKings CEO Jason Robins.

For 2019's Super Bowl, Robins notes, DraftKings was able to take bets from users in just one state: New Jersey. Last year, the app was live in five states. Now, it's up to 12.

Meet the two players that dominate the business

DraftKings, along with FanDuel, is already a market leader. The two companies have emerged as the Coke and Pepsi of the sports betting industry.

Both firms are letting gamblers place traditional bets like who will win the game and/or cover the point spread. (The Chiefs are favored by 3.)

But gamblers can also make so-called proposition or ""prop"" bets on outcomes such as who will win the game's MVP trophy -- Robins said the Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes is the favorite with the Buccaneers' Tom Brady a close second -- or which player will score the first touchdown.

DraftKings is also hoping to take advantage of the Super Bowl spotlight to add even more customers. Robins told CNN Business the company is running two 15-second commercials on Sunday night: one just before halftime and another in the third quarter.

FanDuel's King said he was not concerned about the fact that DraftKings is advertising during the game -- and potentially increasing its exposure with customers as a result.

King said it didn't make sense for FanDuel to buy ad time this year. CBS is reportedly charging roughly $5.5 million for a 30-second spot. But he didn't rule out running commercials in future Super Bowls, noting there are enough gamblers around to support several successful companies in the business.

""We're very much in the early stages of this industry. If you compare it to any other digital and disruptive industry, there will be a shakeout,"" King said. ""But it's not going to be a winner take all market. There will be a few big players.""

Casino companies look to cash in on sports betting too

Barstool has the potential to be a third major player in online gaming as the company continues to expand to other states.

""We're happy with the early returns, but we're in this great spot where we think we can generate meaningful market share and profitability just relying on (our) Barstool media partnership,"" said Penn National Gaming CEO Jay Snowden on the company's earnings conference call Thursday morning.

MGM MGM IAC IAC Casino giant, which is now backed by Barry Diller's, is also increasing its online sports betting presence. And Bally's recently announced it was buying leading fantasy sports company Monkey Knife Fight.

Caesars CZR is moving more aggressively into the business as well, thanks to its planned acquisition of UK-based bookmaker William Hill and a partnership with fantasy sports company SuperDraft.

""Nobody besides FanDuel and DraftKings has any major market share at this point,"" said Caesars co-president of sports and online gaming Eric Hession. ""But the reason we are making these investments is that over the longer term, we can create a compelling offering.""

Hession added that gaming companies like Caesars can leverage their existing base of gamblers in physical casinos and take advantage of their brand name and marketing prowess. Caesars is inviting about 250 of its most loyal customers to watch the Super Bowl at a socially distanced event at Allegiant Stadium, home of the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders.

Several other companies in the fantasy sports and gambling world are looking to take advantage of the hype around the Super Bowl -- as well as other live sports.

A company named PrizePicks even allows fans to make mixed sports predictions: A customer could make a combined prediction on, say, how many fantasy points Mahomes will tally as well as how many points Bradley Beal of the Washington Wizards will score against the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday.

So there's plenty of gambling and contest interest out there for the numerous sports betting and fantasy sports companies to tap into.

""The Super Bowl is a very busy time for us,"" said PrizePicks CEO Adam Wexler. ""It's an active week for all daily sports fantasy sites."""
"Automakers are going green to save money, not just the planet","New York (CNN Business) Virtually all of the world's major automakers are shifting to an all-electric future — and that's as much about the bottom line as it is the environment.

There's good reason for that radical change:EVs are not only key to complying with tougher environmental regulations but they are also far cheaper to manufacture.

Electric vehicles come with several inherent cost advantages — with no internal combustion engine, they have far fewer moving parts, and they require far less labor to assemble.

Ford estimates that an EV will take 30% fewer hours of labor to assemble than a traditional gasoline-powered car.

And the propulsion systems of EVs are much simpler to share across different models than the engines and transmissions that power gasoline vehicles, further increasing efficiency and reducing costs.

GM currently uses more than 500 different powertrain combinations in its lineup of traditional cars. It could have fewer than two dozen combinations powering all the EVs it plans to build.

""EVs are simpler to make, more profitable, and higher growth,"" Adam Jonas, auto analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients last year.

The lower cost of assembling EVs leave major automakers with little choice but to make the switch, said Daniel Ives, technology analyst with Wedbush Securities.

""The traditional automakers, they can't go a half-step towards EVs. It has to be all in,"" he said.

And while the cost of building EVs is expected to continue to drop, the cost of building gasoline-powered vehicles is likely to increase because of the difficulty of complying with stricter emissions regulations coming into effect around the world.

""Internal combustion engines are going to get more and more expensive to meet environmental regulations,"" said Ken Morris, vice president in charge of electric vehicles at GM. ""I think it will be harder to find internal combustion engine suppliers, and the parts necessary to comply with regulation, compared to the ubiquity of EV components.""

The only thing keeping EVs from being cheaper already is the cost of various components, especially the batteries.

But EV component costs have been falling, with battery prices down about 85% over the past 20 years, according to industry estimates.

Costs are expected to continue falling as battery production becomes more efficient and demand rises. Tesla said last fall it is looking at a 56% reduction in battery costs on a per-kilowatt-hour basis in the coming few years.

""The battery technology is getting much more cost-effective. It's going to continue to get better,"" said Brett Smith, director of technology at the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank.

Smith said the changing economics of the auto industry means that car companies can't continue to bet their future on gasoline powered cars, even though EVs make up well less than 5% of global sales today.

""The companies have essentially stopped investing in advanced internal combustion engine research,"" Smith said.

Morris said GM will continue to spend money developing gasoline-powered vehicles because the company will keep building them for more than a decade -- even if it achieves its most ambitious emissions goals. But he also said that 60% of GM's research and development spending is now directed to EVs. The company has previously said it will invest $27 billion in developing EVs. Volkswagen is committing to invest even more -- €35 billion, or some $43 billion.

Tesla's TSLA Ives said another key factor driving traditional automakers to make the shift is the huge increase inshare price. Even though the electric car maker sold only 500,000 cars in 2020, a tiny sliver of the more than 70 million cars and light trucks sold last year, Tesla shares climbed 743% and now are worth more than the combined value of the top 12 global automakers.

""Every board of every automaker has watched the Tesla share run,"" Ives said. ""Maybe they were skeptical two years ago. But its performance since has cemented in the mind of every automaker that it has to go this way."""
'Stop f---ing selling!!!' WallStreetBets Redditors go ballistic over GameStop's sinking share price,"New York (CNN Business) Reddit favorite GameStop (GME) isn't looking so hot this week and some of the stock's biggest backers are freaking out.

After selling off sharply all week, the stock fell another 42% Thursday.

""We have the advantage. All we have to [do] is buy and hold shares,"" wrote one of the users.

Robinhood briefly placed restrictions on trades in GameStop last week. Both Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel Securities have both denied any role in this decision."
Donald Trump is no longer part of SAG-AFTRA,"(CNN) He didn't want to be fired, so he quit.

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday submitted his resignation from SAG-AFTRA, the union representing roughly 160,000 professionals, from actors and musicians to media professionals.

Trump's resignation comes just weeks after the union's National Board voted to have his membership reevaluated by a disciplinary committee, relating to what a press release at the time called Trump's ""role in inciting the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6.""

""Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred -- democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press,"" union president Gabrielle Carteris said. ""There's a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers.""

In his resignation letter, addressed directly to Carteris and made available by SAG-AFTRA on its official website, Trump wrote, ""I no longer wish to be associated with your union,"" citing what he said were ""policy failures.""

This new tool can tell you if your online photos are helping train facial recognition systems,"(CNN Business) When you post photos of yourself or friends and family online, you may not imagine they could be used to develop facial-recognition systems that can identify individuals offline. A new site hopes to raise awareness of this issue by offering a rare window into how a fraction of our pictures are used.

Training a facial-recognition system to identify people requires a slew of photos of faces — photos that are often gathered from the internet. It's usually impossible to figure out if images you've uploaded are among them.

""It's easiest to understand when it becomes more personal,"" said Adam Harvey, an artist and researcher, who created the site with fellow artist and programmer Jules LaPlace, and in collaboration with the non-profit Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP). ""Sometimes it helps to have visual proof.""

The tip of the iceberg

To use the site, you must type in your Flickr username, the URL of a specific Flickr photo, or a hashtag (such as ""#wedding"") to find out whether your photos are included. If photos are found, Exposing.ai will show you a thumbnail of each, along with the month and year that they were posted to your Flickr account and the number of images that are in each dataset.

A search of this author's Flickr username turned up nothing. However, a search for some common hashtags yielded tons of results, but for unknown people: ""#wedding"" returned more than 103,000 photos used in facial-recognition datasets, while searches for ""#birthday"" and ""#party"" yielded tens of thousands of included images, with children's faces in many of the first results.

As Harvey is quick to point out, Exposing.ai examines just a smidgen of the facial data that's in use, as many companies don't publicly reveal how they obtained the data used to train their facial-recognition systems. ""It's the tip of the iceberg,"" he said.

For years researchers and companies have turned to the internet to collect and annotate photos of all kinds of objects — including many, many faces — in hopes of making computers better able to make sense of the world around them. This frequently includes using images from Flickr that carry Creative Commons licenses -- these are special kinds of copyright licenses that clearly state the terms under which such images and videos can be used and shared by others -- as well as pulling images from Google Image search, snagging them from public Instagram accounts or other methods (some legitimate, some perhaps not).

Many of the resulting datasets are destined for academic work, such as training or testing a facial-recognition algorithm. But facial recognition is increasingly moving out of the labs and into the domain of big business, as companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Google stake their futures on AI. Facial recognition software is becoming pervasive in its usage — by police, at airports, and even on smartphones and doorbells

Amid a broader reckoning over the use of individuals' online data, datasets for training facial-recognition software have become a flash point for privacy concerns and a future where surveillance may be more commonplace. Facial-recognition systems themselves are also increasingly scrutinized for concerns about their accuracy and underlying racial bias due, in part, to the data on which they were trained.

More datasets coming soon

Harvey initially planned to use facial-recognition technology to let you search for your own photos, but then realized it could surface photos of other folks that simply look similar to you. A text-based search of things like Flickr usernames and hashtags may be ""less impressive"" to people, he said, but it's a more surefire way of showing whether or not your photos are included in datasets.

Harvey now plans to add two dozen datasets of faces gathered from the internet to Exposing.ai this year, including the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset compiled by Nvidia and used to train AI to create extremely realistic-looking fake faces . (Nvidia offers an online tool to check whether your photos are in that dataset, but it doesn't search any additional datasets.) This will take some time, notes Liz O'Sullivan, technology director at STOP, because there are so many of these datasets out there.

It's unclear how people will react to learning more about how their photos are used. Casey Fiesler, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies the ethics of using public data, has found that people have mixed responses to, say, learning their Twitter posts were used for research. They might be baffled, find it creepy, or not care at all. In the case of photos used for training facial-recognition systems, however, she suspects people won't know what to do with the revelation that their images have been included.

""You see that your face is in there,"" she said. ""Then what?""

In many cases, there isn't much of an answer to this question. Harvey said he will add a form to Exposing.ai with information that can be used to request that a dataset author remove you from their list of images. But even if that can be done, he said anyone who has downloaded the dataset in the past is not going to take your photos out of their copy. Some datasets — such as MegaFace , which was released by University of Washington researchers in 2016 — are no longer being shared, but copies are already widely distributed. Harvey recommends that people who don't want their images used for facial-recognition training either take them offline or make them private.

""There's no real best-case scenario,"" Harvey said. ""There are only less-worse-case scenarios."""
"Read the $2.7 billion lawsuit against Fox News, Rudy Guiliani and Sidney Powell","Smartmatic filed a $2.7 billion lawsuit on Thursday against Fox News, some of the network's star hosts, including Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro and pro-Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, alleging the parties worked in concert to wage a ""disinformation campaign"" about the company.

Republicans target Democrats and teachers unions over school closures in bid to regain suburban foothold,"Washington (CNN) Republicans in charge of taking back the House and Senate next year hope that a new message focused on reopening schools -- and blaming Democrats and their allies in organized labor for continued closures -- will lure back suburban voters who spurned them in 2020 .

The Republican Senate and House campaign arms, along with Republican outside groups, have coalesced behind a unified message of reopening schools, hoping to put Democrats in a difficult spot between teachers unions and parents, who desperately want their kids to go back to the pre-pandemic days of in-person learning. The fight could also act as a salve for all-out Republican infighting, giving the party a message and target while many are turning their rhetorical fire on each other.

As they ramp up their criticism, Republicans are seeking a return of their own -- to a strategy of tying Democrats to organized labor during a time of strain centering on a hot button issue with special resonance in the suburbs. GOP officials have in a series of coordinated attacks accused Democrats of turning their backs on scientific evidence in order to placate teachers unions, who have been hesitant in some cases to bring members back to classrooms amid concerns over safe working conditions.

""Science is not the obstacle. Federal money is not the obstacle. The obstacle is a lack of willpower,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday. ""Not among students. Not among parents. Just among the rich, powerful unions that donate huge sums to Democrats and get a stranglehold over education in many communities.""

McConnell's remarks set off a firestorm among some Democrats and union leaders, who accused the Senate's top Republican of seeking to gin up misguided anger over an issue that the GOP, during the last year of Donald Trump's presidency, largely ignored.

The Biden administration, which has been peppered with questions about in-person learning as the Republican blitz picks up speed, supports re-opening schools, but has largely stayed in lockstep with teachers unions as they push for funds to redesign and update the modern classroom in a way that meets Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued safety guidelines.

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, hit back at McConnell in an interview, accusing Republicans of ""rank hypocrisy"" and blamed the previous administration's trafficking in disinformation about the pandemic for effectively engineering the current impasse.

""That (McConnell) would scapegoat educators -- it's exactly like Trump scapegoating health care workers, when there was a shortage of PPE, suggesting that they were stealing the PPE,"" Weingarten told CNN.

She also described the latest round of messaging from Republican leaders as a transparent attempt to turn frustrated parents against hard-working educators who share similar concerns, but are demanding more robust government aid to assure a safe return.

""They always fight for the big guy, and they always try to pit the little guy against each other,"" Weingarten said of Republicans. ""It is pathetic that the people who are on the front line, people who have been helping kids all throughout this time, turning their lives upside down, working triple and quadruple time, and (Republicans) are trying to pit them against parents and scapegoat them to mask their own failures.""

Winning back the suburbs

For Republicans, the politics are less complicated than the underlying issue: The suburbs were the primary cause of GOP losses in both the 2018 midterms and 2020 election, with candidates like Trump ceding significant ground with moderate Republican voters. Talk of schools and casting the unions and their Democratic allies as the only barrier to a return to pre-pandemic normalcy offers, in Republicans' estimation, a more convincing case to suburban voters with school-aged children than the race-baiting rhetoric over migrant caravans and gang violence that the party adopted under Trump.

Republican senators introduced a budget amendment on Thursday to withhold Covid relief funding for schools that don't reopen in-person learning after teachers are vaccinated. Even though it won't pass, the ploy will put Democrats on record for a vote that Republicans could use in political attacks.

And Republicans with their eyes on the party's presidential nomination in 2024 have begun to weigh in on the issue.

""There is a real decision to be made in America right now that will have lasting implications,"" tweeted Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and top diplomat under Trump. ""Choosing between the unions and our children. If our children are our future, then where is the President?""

Whether the message will land in the nation's suburbs, however, remains an open question.

Amanda Mitsuda, a mother of four who lives in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert, said on Wednesday that she was thrilled this week when her children -- one 16-year-old high school junior, one 13-year-old eighth grader and 11-year old twins in fifth grade -- went back to in-person learning this week. But the registered Republican who voted for Biden in 2020 said the issue does nothing to change her view of current Republicans.

""I am friends with a lot of people that are very angry and they feel like the kids should be in school,"" Mitsuda said. ""Dr. (Anthony) Fauci is saying the literature doesn't support keeping the kids from schools... so, I do think that should ultimately be what we are heading towards.""

But any attempt by Republicans to use the issue to win back Trump-skeptic voters are ""totally missing the point,"" she said. ""There are some major things they have to correct, like letting particular people go that supported Trump.""

House Republican leadership's refusal so far to sideline or denounce members like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose long history espousing radical right-wing conspiracy theories has caused an uproar among Democrats and some in the GOP, suggests the new messaging pivot might not pass muster.

""The schools,"" Mitsuda said, are ""small fries"" when compared to more existential Republican issues.

Whether Republicans can win back the suburbs will be central to their success in 2022. In Arizona, the party's problem were acute: Not only did the state elect two Democratic Senators -- Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly -- during the Trump era, but Biden last year became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to win there since 1948. The swing has left Republican looking for ways to reverse the trend ahead of midterm elections that traditionally favor the opposition party.

As they try to put a dent in Democrats' gains, National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman T.W. Arrighi this week sought to reframe the terms of the debate. ""'Unions Above Children,'"" he declared, ""is the new motto of the Democrats' plan to reopen schools.""

But the Trump wing of the party remains robust -- and hard to ignore -- on Capitol Hill. The party establishment is twisted in knots over what to do about Greene, a fierce Trump backer who has laughed off or scorned their attempts to rein her in.

""She's not going to be the face of the party,"" Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the new chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said of Greene.

Fight happening at local level

The Republican strategy of hitting Democrats for school closures has been buoyed by data from the federal government, including a number of the same agencies and figures targeted and denigrated by Trump during his time in office.

""There is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday. ""Safe reopening does not suggest that teachers need to be vaccinated in order to reopen safely.""

Major unions have largely acknowledge that it will be impossible to fully vaccinate their members as a precondition for returning, though many have asked officials to more highly prioritize educators. There has been more focus, broadly, on ramping up in-school testing, establishing clear safety metrics and improving building infrastructure, like ventilation.

Last week, the CDC released a report on schools in a rural Wisconsin county last fall, which found that of the 191 Covid cases identified in students and staff, only seven — all students — were linked to in-school spread. Republicans have sought to use the results to flip the script on Democrats, who campaigned in 2020, led by Biden, by pledging, above all else, to follow the science on the coronavirus.

Weingarten called the Wisconsin study a ""really good piece of data,"" but said the survey -- which covered 17 schools with, as the CDC wrote, ""appropriate mitigation efforts in place"" -- did not offer an ""apples to apples comparison to what's happened in Chicago"" and other major cities.

Democrats in Washington, including some of Biden's top lieutenants, have also pushed back on the suggestion that they are bending to unreasonable requests from supporters in organized labor.

Jeffrey Zients, Biden's Covid czar, said Wednesday Congress has ""to do its part"" in passing the president's $1.9 trillion plan to address the health and economic crises, including additional funding to give schools ""better access"" to testing, personal protective equipment, improve ventilation and school sanitization, and ""support the learning and social, emotional needs of our kids in what have been an extremely, extremely difficult year.""

""President Biden has been very clear that he wants schools to reopen, and actually to stay open,"" said Zients.

But the brunt of the fight is being felt most intensely at the local level.

City and county officials -- not the federal government -- determine the operations of school districts. In Chicago, the public schools system and teachers union are locked in tense negotiations over safety metrics, vaccine distribution and accommodations for teachers in high-risk households. The city attorney in San Francisco sued its school district Wednesday to try to reopen schools. And in Virginia, the Democratic-controlled state Senate passed a bill sponsored by a Republican on Tuesday to require local districts to make in-person learning available to students.

""I think there's a lot of parents who are now looking at their public schools a little bit differently than they had before,"" said GOP pollster Robert Blizzard, whose firm recently looked at the issue in suburban Virginia. ""They may forgive but they're not going to forget."
Covid-19 vaccine rollout puts a spotlight on unequal internet access,"(CNN Business) In January 2020, members of Congress held a hearing to discuss the importance of digital literacy and closing the digital divide, or who has access to broadband internet and who doesn't. Just weeks later, the coronavirus began sweeping across the country and upending the lives of many Americans. In so doing, it shone an even brighter spotlight on the internet haves and have-nots, a dividing line in America that often is shaped by one's age, income level, race, and hometown.

The next phase of the pandemic is proving to be no different. Some of the same internet have-nots who have been at risk of losing access to remote education, telemedicine and social connections throughout the pandemic are now at risk of being left out when it comes to registering for the vaccine.

In many states, elderly populations are among the first eligible for the vaccine, but with registration largely taking place online, some are forced to lean on family members and volunteers with high-speed internet and more digital know-how to register.

Francesca Knerr, who is based in Connecticut, told CNN Business that her aunt and uncle, both in their 80s, were eligible for the vaccine but do not use the internet. ""They don't have email addresses. They have an iPad they don't know how to use,"" she said."
"Voting technology company Smartmatic files $2.7 billion lawsuit against Fox News, Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell over 'disinformation campaign'","New York (CNN) A voting technology company swept up in baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election filed a monster $2.7 billion lawsuit on Thursday against Fox News, some of the network's star hosts, and pro-Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, alleging the parties worked in concert to wage a ""disinformation campaign"" that has jeopardized its very survival.

""We have no choice,"" Antonio Mugica, the chief executive and founder of Smartmatic, told CNN Business in an interview about the company's decision to file the lawsuit. ""The disinformation campaign that was launched against us is an obliterating one. For us, this is existential, and we have to take action.""

The lawsuit, filed in New York state court, accused Fox, Giuliani, Powell and hosts Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, and Jeanine Pirro of intentionally lying about Smartmatic in an effort to mislead the public into the false belief that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from former President Donald Trump.

""They needed a villain,"" the lawsuit said. ""They needed someone to blame. They needed someone whom they could get others to hate. A story of good versus evil, the type that would incite an angry mob, only works if the storyteller provides the audience with someone who personifies evil.""

""Without any true villain, defendants invented one,"" the lawsuit added. ""Defendants decided to make Smartmatic the villain in their story.""

In a statement on behalf of the network and the named hosts issued after the lawsuit was filed, a Fox News spokesperson said, ""FOX News Media is committed to providing the full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear opinion. We are proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend this meritless lawsuit in court.""

Asked for comment, Powell said in a statement, ""I have not received notice or a copy of this alleged lawsuit. However, your characterization of the claims shows that this is just another political maneuver motivated by the radical left that has no basis in fact or law.""

In a statement of his own, Giuliani said, ""The Smartmatic lawsuit presents another golden opportunity for discovery. I look forward to litigating with them.""

Giuliani and Powell have also been sued by another voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems, for promoting their voter fraud conspiracies. Giuliani called Dominion's lawsuit against him an ""act of intimidation"" to ""censor the exercise of free speech"" and Powell called Dominion's lawsuit against her ""baseless.""

In the immediate aftermath of his loss, Trump falsely asserted that the election had been rigged against him. His allies, including Fox, Giuliani, and Powell, promoted various conspiracy theories about Smartmatic, which only provided its services to Los Angeles County in the 2020 general election, to support Trump's false claims.

The baseless conspiracy theories peddled about Smartmatic, which mimicked those pushed against Dominion, falsely suggested that the company's technology was used throughout the country and allowed the November vote to be rigged against Trump.

Some strains of the conspiracy theory pushed on Fox aimed to tie the company to the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez. Other strains suggested that Dominion used Smartmatic's voting software in swing states and that votes were exported out of the country to be tabulated; both assertions were false and Smartmatic pointed out in its lawsuit that it doesn't work with Dominion as the two companies are competitors.

""It took us completely by surprise,"" Mugica told CNN Business of the conspiracy theories, noting during the interview that his company has done business in multiple continents and dozens of countries. ""We have never seen something like this in developed markets. We have never seen something like this before in Europe. We have never seen something like this before in the US.""

Throughout the nearly 300-page lawsuit, Smartmatic surgically dismantled the theories against it.

""The Earth is round. Two plus two equals four. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the 2020 election for President and Vice President of the United States,"" the lawsuit said. ""The election was not stolen, rigged, or fixed. These are facts. They are demonstrable and irrefutable.""

Smartmatic's lawyer, J. Erik Connolly, told CNN Business that the case is one of the most ""straightforward"" he has ever seen. Connolly, who secured one of the largest defamation settlements ever in the ""pink slime"" case against ABC News, told CNN Business that because Smartmatic's role in the 2020 general election was limited to providing services to Los Angeles County, he could easily prove all the conspiracy theories false.

""By being able to say Smartmatic was in Los Angeles County and nowhere else, I've been able to prove a lie of everything they essentially said with one salient fact,"" Connolly told CNN. ""I've been doing this for a long time and that might be one of the easiest ways to demonstrate falsity that I've ever had.""

Smartmatic said in the lawsuit that the conspiracy theories had undermined its business relationships around the world, resulted in a wave of threats against its staff, and contributed to a $767.4 million drop in its parent company's projected profits over the next five years.

Additionally, the lawsuit said, Smartmatic will need to spend $350,000 annually over the next two years in increased security costs to protect the physical safety of its workers and nearly $5 million in fees over the next five years to safeguard the company from a ""meteoric rise"" in cyberattacks.

Smartmatic's parent company estimated that the ""disinformation concocted and spread by the defendants"" had cost it at least $2.7 billion in total damages, $2.4 billion of which is specific to Smartmatic, according to the suit.

Smartmatic's lawyers sent a legal notice to Fox in December demanding a ""a full and complete retraction of all false and defamatory statements."" The legal notice said the retraction needed to be executed with ""the same intensity and level of coverage that you used to defame the company in the first place.""

Soon afterward, Fox ran a surreal point-by-point fact-check on the programs hosted by Dobbs, Pirro, and Bartiromo. The segment, which first aired December 18 on Dobbs' show, featured an interview with voting technology expert Eddie Perez who corrected a series of falsehoods that have been amplified and promoted on the network's various programs.

Smartmatic used the fact-check segment in its lawsuit to argue that Fox could have easily articulated the facts and conveyed the truth to viewers before its legal notice.

""Mr. Perez was always available to the Fox defendants,"" the lawsuit said. ""The Fox defendants could have put Mr. Perez on air at any time prior to December 18.""

Smartmatic's lawsuit also pointed to a November segment from Fox News host Tucker Carlson in which he told viewers that Powell had not provided him any evidence to support her election conspiracies. The lawsuit referred to Carlson as a ""respected figure"" within the network and concluded that if Powell had provided any evidence to Fox to support her wild allegations, it would have been shared with him.

The lawsuit alleged Fox and its hosts ""were motivated, in part, by the desire for ratings, to cater to individuals and companies supporting President Trump, and to avoid losing viewers to competing media organizations like OAN and Newsmax.""

Fox faced intense backlash for having been the first network to call the state of Arizona for now-President Joe Biden. The controversial call by the network's decision desk, which days later proved to be accurate, infuriated Trump and his supporters. Many of those supporters flocked to Newsmax and OAN, smaller right-wing channels which for weeks refused to acknowledge Biden's legal victory.

The loss of that audience has created a problem for Fox. In January, the network slipped from first place to third for the first time since 2001. The network has attempted to win back upset viewers by increasing the footprint of its right-wing opinion programming.

Mugica told CNN Business that when he first saw a conspiracy theory floated about Smartmatic he thought nothing of it and dismissed it as absurd.

""I thought it was crazy, but it's so crazy that it's going to have no legs whatsoever,"" he said. ""And then it became very clear it was not a single mention. They were repeating the message and repeating the message. It was an ongoing campaign.""

Mugica said that ""95%"" of his time has been devoted to pushing back against inaccurate information about his company.

""Everything we are doing every day is to survive,"" he said.

Asked directly if there is a real chance Smartmatic will be unable to weather the storm it faces, Mugica replied, ""Yeah, absolutely. It is a real possibility.""

Connolly said that Smartmatic has not ruled out the possibility of bringing additional lawsuits against other entities, such as OAN and Newsmax. Asked whether the company will file a lawsuit against Trump, Connolly said it is mulling the possibility, but conceded it would be difficult.

""We are obviously looking into all the potential lawsuits that can be brought. We don't do this lightly,"" he said. ""I think it is very difficult if not impossible to bring a lawsuit against a President based upon statements a President made while wearing the hat of President.""

Connolly, who estimated the lawsuit will take between two and five years to resolve, said that he hoped the actions taken by Smartmatic might clear up the polluted information environment in the US.

""I think it's the type of case that has to be brought right now to try to get us away from disinformation,"" Connolly said. ""Disinformation has a free rein right now. This kind of case can be a shot across the bow that courts can deliver that says, 'Let's get back to reality. Let's get back to factual reporting.'""

Black people in history: Little-known figures to know,"James Armistead’s life would make a great movie.

Under Lafayette, the French general who helped the American colonists fight for their freedom, he infiltrated the British army as a spy near the end of the Revolutionary War.

He once reported to Benedict Arnold, the traitorous colonist who betrayed his troops to fight for the British. And he provided crucial intelligence that helped defeat the British and end the war.

Armistead was a slave in Virginia in 1781 when he got permission from his owner, who helped supply the Continental Army, to join the war effort. Lafayette dispatched him as a spy, posing as a runaway slave, and he joined British forces in Virginia who valued his knowledge of the local terrain.

Once he’d gained their trust, Armistead moved back and forth between the two armies’ camps, feeding false information to the British while secretly documenting their strategies and relaying them to Lafayette.

His most crucial intel detailed British general Charles Cornwallis’ plans to move thousands of troops from Portsmouth to Yorktown. Armed with this knowledge, Lafayette alerted George Washington, and they set up a blockade around Yorktown which led to Cornwallis’ surrender.

Virginia lawmakers, after lobbying by Lafayette, granted Armistead his freedom in 1787. His owner, William Armistead, was paid £250.

Armistead married, raised a family and spent the rest of his life as a free man on his own Virginia farm. He added Lafayette to his name as a token of gratitude to the French general.*Some sources list his birth year as 1760 and his death year as 1832."
Opinion: I was a member of a cult. Here's how to bring QAnon believers back to reality,"Steven Hassan, PhD, is a licensed mental health counselor and author of The Cult of Trump. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

One of the indelible images from the January 6 invasion of the US Capitol is of Jacob Chansley dressed in horns, a bearskin headdress, red, white and blue face paint, and carrying a spear. Chansley had been deeply affected by the relentless assertions of former President Donald Trump that the election was stolen. And yet Chansley's attorney recently announced that he is willing to testify against Trump at the impeachment trial. Chansley reportedly feels betrayed because no pardons were issued to protect him and other QAnon supporters who participated.

QAnon is often referred to in the media and by politicians as a conspiracy theory, but it is more than that. Conspiracy theories are encouraged and promoted, but QAnon is a political cult that recruits and indoctrinates primarily online. At its core, QAnon teaches that dozens of politicians and A-list celebrities work in tandem with governments around the globe to engage in child sex abuse. They also generally believe that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against Trump.

A change of loyalty such as Chansley's is one response cult members may have when promises made by their leaders are not fulfilled. Others who were not arrested may not face such dissonance. Because QAnon members are messaging constantly, many may continue to believe the conspiracy theories and blindly follow them.

I can personally relate. After a near fatal van crash due to sleep deprivation in 1976, I was deprogrammed from the Moonies (known by many as the Unification Church) and the influence of the movement's leader, Sun Myung Moon . Waking up from an authoritarian cult has motivated me for the last 45 years to help others understand mind control tactics and to free themselves. I was deceptively recruited and did not understand the systematic social influence processes that had been used on me (and I used on others) until my deprogramming got me to open my mind.

How had I been turned against my family, my religion, my country? How could I give blind allegiance to a malignant narcissist? I would have died on command or killed on command. I slept three to four hours each night and worked seven days a week for no pay.

"Smuggler caught with nearly 1,000 cacti and succulents strapped to her body","(CNN) A woman who strapped nearly 1,000 succulents and endangered cacti to her body in an attempt to smuggle them into New Zealand has been sentenced to 100 hours of community work, the country's biosecurity ministry said.

Wenqing Li, 38, who also goes by the name Wendy, was caught bringing plants and seeds from China to Auckland International Airport , where the goods were seized, on two occasions in 2019.

In the first incident, in March 2019, Li had stuffed 947 cacti and succulents into stockings and strapped them to her body. The hoard contained eight endangered and threatened species and was worth more than 10,000 New Zealand dollars ($7,200), the Ministry for Primary Industries, which is responsible for biosecurity, said in a press release Wednesday.

The woman has been sentenced to intensive supervision after authorities found $7,185 worth of plants on her person.

Li, who is from the North Island city of Auckland, had attempted to dispose of the plants in airport toilets after attracting the attention of a police dog. But authorities said they found a ""large amount"" of plant materials around the toilet facilities, including in a rubbish bin.

In a separate incident in July 2019, Li was found to have hidden 142 unauthorized seeds inside iPad covers in her luggage and more than 200 garden ornaments and plant pots -- carrying a snail and pieces of tree fern stem -- which were all wrapped in wet paper.

New data shows many Black Americans remain hesitant to get Covid-19 vaccine,"(CNN) More than half of Black adults in the US remain hesitant to get the Covid-19 vaccine and experts say new data underscores the need to prioritize equitable access and redouble efforts to build trust within communities.

Respondents said they either don't plan to get the shot or they are uncertain if they should or will get the shot, according to a new survey released Thursday by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

The survey found that only 49% of Black adults plan to get the vaccine with 19% of those people saying say they will get it right away and 31% preferring to wait.

Conversely, 31% of Black adults say they will not get the vaccine and 20% say they are unsure.

The findings come as data from many states reveal that White people are getting vaccinated at an average of twice the rate of Black people.

McKinsey to pay nearly $600 million in settlements over its work with opioid companies,"New York (CNN Business) McKinsey & Company, one of the world's largest consulting firms, will pay nearly $600 million in multiple settlements over its work consulting for drug companies that states say fueled the nation's opioid crisis .

McKinsey reached the agreement with a coalition of 47 attorneys general, the District of Columbia and five US territories. The company settled separately with the attorneys general of Washington and West Virginia.

The $573 million multistate settlement, announced Thursday, ""resolves investigations by the attorneys general into the company's role in working for opioid companies, helping those companies promote their drugs, and profiting millions of dollars from the opioid epidemic,"" according to a press release from the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James.

""We chose to resolve this matter in order to provide fast, meaningful support to communities across the United States,"" Kevin Sneader, global managing partner of McKinsey, said in a statement on the settlement

""We deeply regret that we did not adequately acknowledge the tragic consequences of the epidemic unfolding in our communities,"" Sneader's statement continued. ""With this agreement, we hope to be part of the solution to the opioid crisis in the U.S.""

The abuse of OxyContin and other opioid prescription painkillers has become an epidemic in the United States that is blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""The opioid crisis has hit every corner of this nation,"" James said during a Thursday press conference on the settlement. ""Families are destroyed, opportunities are gone.""

James' office added that this ""is the first multistate opioid agreement to result in substantial payment to states to address the crisis."" Funds from the settlement are expected to be used to help address the effects of the opioid epidemic in the participating states. The agreement also includes a consent order in which McKinsey agreed to certain terms of operation.

McKinsey said Thursday it has ""reaffirmed the commitment it made two years ago not to advise clients on any opioid-related business anywhere in the world."" The settlement does not involve an admission of wrongdoing or liability, and McKinsey said it believes its past work was lawful.

In addition to the multistate settlement, McKinsey also reached separate agreements with the Washington and West Virginia state attorneys general for $13.5 million and $10 million, respectively.

McKinsey's plan to 'turbocharge' Purdue's opioid sales

Early on in its work for the pharmaceutical company, McKinsey advised Purdue that ""it could increase OxyContin sales through physician targeting and specific messaging to prescribers.""

In 2009, McKinsey developed strategies for the company to help increase ""brand loyalty"" to the drug among patients and prescribers, it states.

Four years later, McKinsey advised Purdue that it could increase OxyContin sales, including by focusing on selling to the doctors who wrote the most prescriptions, the complaint alleges. McKinsey worked with Purdue to implement its plan to ""Turbocharg[e] Purdue's Sales Engine,"" which resulted in increased opioid sales, especially of OxyContin, according to the complaint.

McKinsey's help in implement the plan included ""assisting with sales representative training, productivity, messaging, and call plans, IT systems, promotional strategies, and market forecasting,"" the complaint states.

""McKinsey continued to work with Purdue, including on a project that identified the growing addiction crisis as a profit-making opportunity,"" the complaint continues, adding that McKinsey advised Purdue to start making ""opioid rescue and treatment medications in order to profit from the realities of dependence, addiction, and abuse.""

Johnson & Johnson JNJ Endo ENDP The complaint also asserts that McKinsey worked with other opioid manufacturers, includingand, both of which have been involved in other opioid-related litigation . Endo declined to comment on the McKinsey settlement; Johnson & Johnson did not return a request for comment.

McKinsey also consulted for governments and nonprofits ""working to abate the raging opioid crisis,"" at the same time it was working with drug companies, the complaint states.

The settlement announced Thursday includes a conflict-of-interest clause that requires the company to provide a written disclosure of any ""material conflict"" when engaging in work with government clients going forward.

""McKinsey partners were ... seeking to turbocharge a tragic undertaking,"" Phil Weiser, Colorado's attorney general, said of the firm's work with opioid sellers during the Thursday press conference. ""They didn't act responsibly. They put profit over people's lives.""

However Weiser, James and several other attorneys general lauded McKinsey during the press conference for agreeing to the settlement. ""McKinsey ... should be thanked for coming to the table, resolving this and for recognizing the harm that they caused all across this nation,"" James said.

The settlement

Money from the agreement will be used to help communities struggling with the effects of the opioid crisis, the attorneys general said Thursday. Oregon's portion of the settlement, for example, will be directed to the Drug Treatment and Recovery Services Fund, an account created by the state's voters last year ""to treat substance use disorder as a public health problem and to provide necessary treatment,"" Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said during the press conference.

As part of the settlement , McKinsey agreed not to accept any future work related to "" any opioid or other opioid-based Schedule II or III controlled substance,"" court documents state.

The settlement also includes a provision requiring McKinsey to provide states with documents related to its work around opioids, including its communications and documents concerning its work with Purdue and other pharmaceutical companies, which will likely be compiled into a public repository.

""(The settlement) makes public documents at the heart of the epidemic so that scholars, journalists and the public can learn what went wrong so that it never happens again,"" Rosenblum said."
Michelle Obama interviews Amanda Gorman for Time about impostor syndrome and making poetry 'cool',"(CNN) Amanda Gorman , the 22-year-old poet and star of President Joe Biden's inauguration, has met Michelle Obama only three times, most recently on Inauguration Day.

But she left a lasting impression on the former first lady, so much so that Obama interviewed Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate, for her cover story in the upcoming issue of Time magazine.

Gorman and Obama spoke remotely for the magazine's ""Black renaissance"" issue, which included work from anti-racism scholar Ibram X. Kendi , authors Brit Bennett and Jesmyn Ward and filmmaker Ava DuVernay

In a wide-ranging conversation, the two discussed how to make poetry ""cool,"" experiencing impostor syndrome as Black women at the peak of their powers and the sudden spotlight both fell into -- Obama in 2007, when her husband announced his presidential campaign, and Gorman in January, when millions of Americans watched her assuredly deliver her poem, ""The Hill We Climb.""

""You've always had so much poise and grace, but seeing you address the whole country like that, I couldn't help thinking to myself: Well, this girl has grown all the way up,"" Obama said. ""It made me so happy.""

In another nod to ""Hamilton"" scribe Lin-Manuel Miranda, whom she referenced in an interview with Anderson Cooper , Gorman said the mantra she recites ahead of her performances was inspired by Miranda's lyrics from the film ""Moana.""

""I really wanted something that I could repeat because I get so terrified whenever I perform,"" she said. ""So my mantra is: 'I'm the daughter of Black writers who are descended from Freedom Fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me.'""

And she took inspiration, too, from Obama's speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention , where she said, ""I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.""

When Obama asked Gorman if she had advice for young Black girls to ""earn their way into the spotlight,"" the poet said that while she's still learning how to navigate fame and media scrutiny, she's focusing on the ""big picture.""

""You really have to crown yourself with the belief that what I'm about and what I'm here for is way beyond this moment,"" Gorman said. ""I'm learning that I am not lightning that strikes once. I am the hurricane that comes every single year, and you can expect to see me again soon."""
The US may soon have its first standards for consumer face masks. Are they strict enough?,"(CNN) American consumers may be about to get the first standards for face masks.

The coronavirus pandemic triggered a sudden intense need for masks that had Americans making masks at home out of T-shirts and bandanas. Hundreds of new and untested products flooded the marketplace with almost no oversight or regulation, making consumer masks the Wild West of personal protection equipment.

That is set to change.

ASTM International, an international technical standards organization, and the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, are working on standards to ""establish minimum design, performance (testing), labeling, user instruction, reporting and classification, and conformity assessment requirements for barrier face coverings.""

In other words, they hope to be able to help Americans tell which masks actually work.

The draft guidance includes both single use and reusable masks and outlines specific requirements for evaluating the performance of reusable masks.

They are set for review Wednesday by ASTM International and its Subcommittee on Respiratory Hazards, which includes representatives from academia, industry stakeholders, government agencies and independent participants. The review process is ongoing, and these guidelines are subject to further review and change.

The proposed standards are meant to create ""a level playing field for demonstration of product claims and avoid the general confusion related to barrier face covering effectiveness,"" according to a draft of the standards provided to CNN by ASTM International.

Some experts have called for mask guidance and regulation from the start of the pandemic, and the ASTM guidelines could be a crucial first step. CNN spoke with experts that did not see the confidential draft in its entirety.

Assessing size and fit

Dr. Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland who studies how viruses are transmitted, believes these standards will fill a major regulatory gap. ""You've got all these knockoff masks coming in. They're not very good, claiming to be N95 and they're not. So having some benchmarks is a step in the right direction,"" he told CNN.

""This is desperately needed because people have no guidance at all right now,"" Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech with expertise in airborne transmission of viruses, air quality and nanotechnology, told CNN.

If the standards are adopted, each mask would come with a set of user instructions that describe proper sizing, fit and cleaning protocol. The standards strictly prohibit the use of vents, valves or any feature that allows people to blow out or breathe in unfiltered air.

The draft guidelines would also require manufacturers to test their facial coverings in accredited labs to certify performance, register their products and use the outlined labeling system to use the ASTM labeling designations.

Perhaps the most important change ASTM is proposing is a labeling system. Consumers in stores would be able to evaluate the quality of masks on store shelves from the labeling on the packaging. If a mask has ASTM labeling, it could ensure the customer that product has met the testing and quality requirements.

The drafted ASTM standard labeling requirements would indicate results of two testing criteria: breathability and filtration efficiency. Typically, when a mask has a higher filtration, it results in more resistance and can make it harder to breathe.

According to the ASTM draft guidelines, a lower performance, level one designation would require the product to filter 20% of particles -- something that would make the mask easy to breathe through, but that would provide less protection. A level two certification would designate high performance filtration of at least 50% of particles but would provide less breathability.

""The use of the 'levels' defines a classification system intended to aid in understanding potential tradeoffs for higher levels of filtration efficiency with airflow (breathing) resistance,"" Jonathan Szalajda, deputy director at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, told CNN in a statement.

Trading comfort for protection

Milton believes information on breathability would be an important consideration for consumers with chronic lung or heart disease and other conditions that might require easier breathability in a mask.

""It gives people information to make decisions on what they want, and what level of protection they feel they need,"" Milton told CNN.

ASTM's main test -- whether a mask can filter out particles measuring 0.3 microns. Why this size? It's a hard one to stop, and if a mask can handle a particle that size, it can stop droplets most likely to carry viruses and bacteria.

Marr understands why 20% and 50% protection benchmarks might seem low to the public but believes the actual performance against the virus could surpass 50%.

""That criteria is for a certain size particle that is really the hardest size to filter out,"" she told CNN. ""It's very likely that the virus is mostly in particles that are larger than that critical size, the test size.""

But while experts grow increasingly concerned at the growing spread of more transmissible coronavirus variants, some believe the draft mask guidelines need to require a higher level of protection to slow the spread and protect people.

""The first iteration may not be where are you want it to be, but it's a step in the right direction to have some quality levels here,"" Milton told CNN. ""I would like to see a level three on the higher end.""

""If you would have asked me this in November last year, I would have said this is okay,"" Marr told CNN. ""But now with, with the more transmissible variants. I'm more concerned. I think it's a higher level of certification...I would like to see another level of performance like 80%.""

Several European countries have already required people wear masks with a minimum filtration efficacy of 80-90% against 0.3-micron particles. Germany, Austria and France have mandated the public to wear high filtration masks on public transport, shopping or in public areas.

While she hopes for the addition of a higher level of protection added to these guidelines, Marr believes that if approved, the standards will have an impact because consumers want and need guidance.

""I think if these standards are out, there will be a demand for the highest level of protection that ASTM is willing to have a level for,"" she told CNN. ""The manufacturers, I think, will step up and provide that.""

Currently, only medical-grade masks and respirators must meet standards. These include the N95 masks, which are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for fit, filtration efficiency, flammability and other qualities.

There are exceptions to this proposed standard that reflect current CDC guidance, with warnings against mask use by children under 2 and those with breathing trouble or inability to remove masks. This guidance does not approve masks for any use in a healthcare setting and is not intended for previously evaluated surgical mask and respirators.

President Biden's administration has emphasized the importance of mask wearing from his first day in office, when he challenged Americans to wear a mask for 100 days in order to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Efforts to improve mask quality are also being taken in Congress. In a letter published Monday several Democratic lawmakers called on President Biden to increase the supply and availability of higher quality masks and encourage the education of the public about which masks are most effective.

""While many Americans understand that wearing a mask can help prevent transmission of the disease, many don't realize that a high-quality mask can make it far less likely that the wearer will contract the disease, even if exposed to an infectious person,"" Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, with California Representatives Adam Schiff and Ro Khanna wrote.

They urged President Biden to ""consider invoking the Defense Production Act to increase the supply of higher quality masks, including N95 or other medical grade masks.""

The lawmakers also ask President Biden to direct the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA to ""provide the public with clear, actionable, and specific information on how to discern which masks are most effective and where they can get them, as well as how to utilize existing options."""
"France not doing enough to tackle climate change, court rules","Paris (CNN) A Paris court has found France legally responsible for its failure to meet targets intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The lawsuit was launched by four NGOs, including Greenpeace France and Oxfam France, following an online petition that gathered 2.3 million signatures -- the largest in French history, according to organizers.

Signatories hoped to ""compel the State to take all necessary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions"" to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target set by the Paris Agreement , according to the online petition.

The Paris Agreement was signed in 2016 by almost all the world's countries, and seeks to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

France, which brokered the pact, has committed to reducing greenhouse gases by 40% by 2030, and has set itself a target of being carbon neutral by 2050.

How to prepare for your Covid-19 vaccination — advice from Dr. Wen,"(CNN) As more people around the world get access to the coronavirus vaccines, many questions remain. Will it work? Will there be side effects? Do I need to rest after I get the vaccine? Can I hang out with my friends and family now?

We spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, for guidance on how to plan for taking care of ourselves and our loved ones as more people get vaccinated.

CNN: Do I need to do anything to prepare for getting the vaccine?

Dr. Leana Wen: With vaccines in short supply, the biggest challenge that people are facing is getting an appointment for vaccination. Depending on where you are, you may be able to sign up with your local city or county health department, a local pharmacy, your doctor's office or a local hospital.

Once you have the appointment, make sure to follow all instructions. Complete paperwork if there is any that you need to do in advance. Bring all required documentation; some places ask for identification or proof of residency, so know what you need and make sure you have it.

If you know of others who received a vaccination at that same location, you can ask what their experiences are like — for example, how long the wait was. Keep in mind that there is a lot that's evolving as sites figure out how best to do mass vaccinations, so someone's experience from a couple of weeks ago might look different now.

Medical staff inoculate the public and first responders at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

I would also urge that you get any questions you have about the vaccines answered in advance. You want to minimize your time at the vaccination site, and the people there are likely to be very busy and may not have the time to answer your questions in-depth. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a great website of FAQs. You can also ask your doctor questions specific to your medical health. When you show up for your appointment, you should be certain that you want to be vaccinated and have had all your questions answered.

CNN: Should people wear masks when they go to get vaccinated?

Wen: Absolutely. The protection from the coronavirus vaccine isn't immediate. Sites will require that you are masked, and you will want to minimize your exposure to coronavirus while waiting in line.

If this is a drive-thru test, the risk of coronavirus exposure is minimal. It's a little higher if you have to wait indoors with others for a prolonged period of time. In that circumstance, I'd recommend a second mask, a well-fitting cloth mask, over the three-ply surgical mask, or you could wear an N95 or KN95 if you have access to one. Try to keep physical distance from others — ideally 10 feet, but at least 6 feet, if you are indoors.

CNN: Assuming I get one of the two-dose vaccines already being used, what's it like? Will I feel anything after the first shot?

Wen: You feel the shot itself, of course, just as you would with any injection. You could have a bit of soreness in the location where you get injected.

Many people have no symptoms beyond that. Some develop side effects in one of two categories. First, they could have more soreness, redness and swelling at the site of the injection. Second, they could have what we call systemic symptoms, meaning that they feel something throughout their body. They may develop headache, fever, fatigue and muscle aches. These could last hours and usually go away after a day.

Most people with these symptoms find them to be a minor inconvenience. They can go to work and go about their day. Some people may feel the symptoms a bit more. Rest usually takes care of the symptoms, and people can also take ibuprofen or Tylenol to help with aches and fever.

CNN: Really? Side effects don't sound so good.

Wen: If you develop these side effects, you should know that this is normal and expected. And that these symptoms are actually good! It means that the vaccines are working. This is your body's reaction. The vaccine is stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies that will protect you against coronavirus infection in the future.

It's important to note that people react differently to vaccines. There are some people who have minimal or no side effects. That doesn't mean there's something wrong with them, either. The vaccine is also working in them, but their bodies are just reacting in a different way.

CNN: I've heard some people feel more side effects after the second shot.

Wen: Anecdotally, this seems to be true. Many people feel very little after the first shot, but have more side effects after the second coronavirus vaccine shot. A hypothesis is that the first shot, the primer, gets your immune system ready. The second shot, the booster, is when your body is already primed and that's why you have stronger response. Remember that the response is a good thing and evidence that the vaccine is working!

Because some people have this stronger reaction the second time around, it's a good idea to try to schedule the shot when you have the ability to rest if needed. Some people schedule the second shot when they are off or at least are able to work from home. If you can't do that, you may want to let your employer know that you're getting the vaccine in case you need to take time off that day or the next.

CNN: Why do people have to wait 15 to 30 minutes after they get the shot?

Wen: The waiting time is just in case someone develops an allergic reaction, which is very rare and on the order of two to six per million people. If a serious allergic reaction were to develop, it would happen very soon after the vaccination.

People should wait 15 minutes just in case. If this is a drive-thru vaccination, they can wait in their cars; otherwise, there is an area where people can sit or stand and be observed just in case they have a reaction. In the very rare circumstance they develop a reaction, this can easily be treated by the nurses and doctors at the site.

Those with a history of very severe allergic reactions to other medications or foods are asked to wait 30 minutes. Note that those individuals can still get the vaccine — the only reason not to get the vaccine is if they have a known allergy to a component of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine itself.

One more thing: After you get vaccinated, please register for the CDC's V-Safe program. You can quickly enter any side effects you may have, and depending on your answers, someone from the CDC may call to check on you. Side effects are to be expected, and the government still tracks them as part of routine monitoring after a vaccine or medication is released.

CNN: I've heard that one shot gives you some protection. Can I skip the second shot?

Wen: No. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are studied as two-dose vaccines. You may get some degree of protection after the first shot, but you won't receive the optimal protection unless you get two shots.

The second shot should be taken in the time period that's approved: three weeks after the first dose for Pfizer and four weeks after the first dose for Moderna. The CDC has said that in exceptional circumstances, you could still get the second shot up to six weeks later, but this should not be the norm.

CNN: How long does it take for me to have full immune protection after getting the second shot? Can I hang out with family and friends after that?

Wen: It takes about two weeks to develop the optimal immune protection after the second shot. The vaccine is about 95% effective, meaning that you are very well protected from having coronavirus.

That's great — but it's not 100%. You must still use caution when around others, and keep up masking and avoiding crowded indoor settings. Remember, too, that we don't know yet whether getting the vaccine means that you are protected against being a carrier for coronavirus. You may not get sick, but you could still infect others if you're a carrier.

All this means that you are better protected against this deadly virus, but you need to still use caution. I know that grandparents have been so eager to see their grandkids. You can do this more safely now, but I'd still try to see people outdoors when possible, with everyone wearing masks, unless everyone has quarantined for seven days and gotten tested. But maybe you can go in for that hug that you've been waiting for. And if you have friends who are also fully vaccinated, it's probably pretty safe to see them.

Deutsche Bank just posted its first profit in years,"London (CNN Business) Deutsche Bank ( DB ) has made an annual net profit for the first time since 2014 thanks to a bumper year in a business it has scaled back.

Germany's largest lender on Thursday reported profit of €113 million ($135.6 million) for 2020, compared to a loss of €5.7 billion ($6.8 billion) the previous year. The last time it reported an annual net profit was 2014, according to data provider Refinitiv.

The turnaround was driven by a 32% increase in revenue at its investment banking division, which has been the focus of a strategic overhaul aimed at shrinking the unit.

The investment bank was the only business unit that grew revenue in 2020, despite Deutsche Bank's plan, unveiled in 2019 , to return to its roots and focus on corporate banking.

""In the most important year of our transformation, we were able to more than offset transformation-related effects and elevated credit provisions — despite the global pandemic,"" CEO Christian Sewing said. ""We're ahead of our own expectations ... and are confident that this overall positive trend will continue in 2021, despite these challenging times,"" he added.

The company has announced several major restructurings since the global financial crisis. The most recent, in 2019, included slashing 18,000 jobs , or 20% of its workforce. It also shuttered its equities sales and trading division, while trimming its rates division.

Sewing told analysts on an earnings call that Deutsche Bank reduced its headcount by 8% in 2020. That helped it to hit its cost targets, he added, and it achieved a €3.3 billion ($4 billion) reduction in two years after cutting expenses for 12 consecutive quarters.

The strong performance from its investment bank offset revenue declines in its corporate bank, private bank and asset management division.

Meal kits and buckets of bubble tea: How KFC's owner is pivoting in China,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Snail noodles, marinated steaks and huge vats of bubble tea are helping China's biggest fast food giant get through the coronavirus crisis.

Yum China YUMC , the local owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, is tapping into new ways to reach customers at home as the pandemic continues to dampen its business.

The company, which reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, said that home delivery and takeout now account for more than 50% of sales. Revenue grew 11% to almost $2.3 billion, though same-store sales dipped 4% in the quarter ended December, compared to the previous year.

""Home consumption is a growing trend. The pandemic has accelerated that,"" CEO Joey Wat told CNN Business.

Yum China is now trying to cash in further on the shift with a push into meal kits, which encourage people to make their own ""KFC"" at home. The product line is an offshoot of KFC called ""Kai Feng Cai,"" which is a Chinese nickname for the brand. But it's no ordinary bucket of fried chicken. Instead, the kit includes dishes such as chicken breast, chicken soup, and chicken ""luosifen,"" a snail-based rice noodle soup dish that has become immensely popular in China.

Dominic Ongwen: Ugandan rebel commander found guilty of war crimes,"(CNN) A former Ugandan rebel commander has been convicted of war crimes at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.

The LRA's fugitive chief Joseph Kony waged a bloody campaign from 2002 to 2004 in northern Uganda.

The ICC convicted Ongwen of 61 of the 70 charges against him.

The 45-year-old's crimes include murder, torture, enslavement, rape, and forced pregnancies, the court said.

The case was the first at the ICC to involve an alleged perpetrator and victim of the same war crimes, with Ongwen himself having been abducted by the rebels as a child while on the way to school, according to his defense.

A former commander of LRA's Sinia Brigade, Ongwen told the court he was abducted from his home by LRA fighters when he was 14.

""We recognize that there may be thought to be something of a paradox in the fact that the stories told by so many of the witnesses in this case could in other circumstances be the story of Dominic Ongwen himself,"" prosecutor Benjamin Gumpert said during the trial.

""But this is no reason to expect that crimes can be committed with impunity. We have a choice as to how we behave, and when that choice is to kill, to rape and to enslave, we must expect to be held to account.""

""Today's ruling remind me that there is something called justice,"" said Jobson Obol, 42. He survived an LRA ambush on a bus in 1999 in which his father died.

""Ongwen is not the only one who was abducted as a child and forced in LRA ranks,"" he told CNN in Uganda's capital, Kampala.

""I have relatives and friends who were abducted and escaped... They were rehabilitated and forgiven by their own communities and families.""

Millicent Ayot, 38, lost her parents and four siblings in an LRA arson attack.

""The convicting of Ongwen serves some relief, but does not bring back lives lost,"" she said. ""We hope the court keeps him in jail for life.""

The court can sentence Ongwen to up to 30 years imprisonment, or a life sentence in certain circumstances, according to the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding document.

The death penalty is not provided for.

Ongwen, nicknamed ""White Ant"", is also the first LRA member to face justice at the tribunal in The Hague or anywhere else over the bloodshed that stretched across four African nations.

The court granted 4,095 victims the right to participate in the trial, which opened in December 2016, according to a press release.

The ICC's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, presented 109 witnesses and experts. and the total cases record include more than 1,760 filings."
The unemployment rate hasn't budged in months as America's jobs crisis drags on,"New York (CNN Business) The jobs recovery has hit a roadblock : The US jobless rate hasn't improved since the fall and economists don't have high hopes that this changed in January.

Economists predict the US jobless rate stayed put at 6.7% in the first month of 2021, which would be the third month in a row with no change. Eleven months into the pandemic, ten months into the jobs crisis and nine months into the ostensible recovery , this is a very bad sign.

The average expectation for jobs added in January is 50,000. That would be a welcome turnaround from the 140,000 jobs lost in December, which was the first monthly loss of jobs since April . If the January forecast holds true, America will still be down nearly 10 million jobs since last February.

But there's a chance the government's jobs report , due out Friday at 8:30 am ET, could be better than expected.

Wednesday's ADP employment report showed private payrolls rose by 174,000 positions in January, far greater than economists expected . And whilethe ADP report and the government report aren't correlated,such a big jump bodes well for the official jobs figures.

Coupled with recent positive surveys of the manufacturing and services sectors, ""there may actually be ... wait for it..... upside risk to this Friday's payroll report,"" wrote BMO senior economist Jennifer Lee in a note on Wednesday.

Here's to hoping.

On Thursday, the Labor Department reported weekly jobless claims fell more than expected in the final week of January, leading to some more optimism about a potential positive surprise in Friday's jobs report.

All eyes on the vaccine rollout

America's jobs market has gone through a tremendous rebound since the economy ground to a halt last spring, adding back millions of jobs over the summer. Even so, the nation remains in a jobs crisis.

More than 18 million people received some form of government benefits in the week ended January 9, according to the Department of Labor

Meanwhile, the hospitality and leisure industry -- which includes restaurants and all kinds of in-person entertainment -- continues to bear the brunt of the job crisis.

""In fact, the food services and drinking places sector was the largest single source of the gap between December's employment level and pre-pandemic levels,"" said Indeed economic research director Nick Bunker in emailed comments. On top of that, all the jobs lost in December were held by women

The sectors can't get fully back to normal until the virus is under control or the pandemic ends. Economists -- and politicians -- are betting that the vaccine rollout will be the cure-all for the economy.

But the rollout is still in its infancy: so far nearly 33 million vaccine doses have been administered in the United States, but only 6 million people have received the all-important second dose, according to data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Congressional Budget Office said in a report Monday that the number of employed Americans won't be back to pre-pandemic level until 2024

But as to how long it will take the nation to recover fully from this jobs crisis -- that remains the great unknown."
COVAX announces plan to distribute more than 330 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to developing nations,"Hong Kong (CNN) The COVAX initiative for equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines has announced its plan to distribute more than 330 million doses to developing nations in the first half of 2021.

In an interim distribution plan published Wednesday, the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility said the doses will cover an average of 3.3% of the total population of the 145 countries participating in the initial round of distribution.

The COVAX initiative was launched in April last year to ensure the rapid and equitable distribution of coronavirus vaccines to rich and poor countries alike and the vaccination of high-risk groups.

Led by the World Health Organization and numerous other international health groups, it has since been joined by 190 countries, but was shunned by the United States, partly because former President Donald Trump did not want to work with WHO.

The first round of distribution includes 336 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine -- 240 million made by the Serum Institute of India and 96 million by AstraZeneca -- as well as 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

A health worker in Nepal holds up a vial of the AstraZeneca-Oxford coronavirus vaccine to administer to frontline health workers at the Armed Police Force Hospital.

But the plan is ""non-binding and may be subject to change,"" with the actual allocation and distribution dependent on a series of caveats, from WHO's emergency use approval to the readiness of countries to receive and administer the vaccines, the document said.

The interim forecast would allow countries to start their immunization strategies, including storage, distribution, databases and how to address vaccine hesitancy, said Dale Fisher, an infectious disease specialist at the National University of Singapore.

""If they know some of the doses are coming over in the next month or two, then it's about time to start getting everything ready,"" he said.

Both vaccines currently in the COVAX initiative require two doses to provide full immunity. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be stored at minus 75 degrees Celsius, or minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit. In comparison, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine can be kept at refrigerator temperatures of 2C to 8C (36F to 46F) for at least six months, making transport and distribution much easier, especially in developing countries that lack cold storage capacities.

But the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only one so far that has secured emergency use approval from WHO. An evaluation of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is currently underway.

Delivery of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is estimated to begin in late February, if all the requirements are met, according to the allocation plan.

""We will soon be able to start delivering life-saving vaccines globally, an outcome we know is essential if we are to have any chance of being able to beat this pandemic,"" said Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI alliance, which secures vaccines for poor countries and along with WHO, is one of the initiative's co-leads.

According to COVAX , the vaccines will be allocated to participating countries proportional to their population size. India, for example, will receive the highest amount -- 97 million doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India.

North Korea is also among the list, due to receive nearly 2 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine. Pyongyang claims the country has not contracted a single case of Covid-19 -- which experts say is likely untrue.

Some wealthy, self-financing countries were also included in the initial distribution plan, such as South Korea, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore.

COVAX is aiming to deliver up to 2 billion doses of coronavirus vaccine to less developed countries by the end of this year, enough to inoculate more than 20% of the populations of its member nations.

But there have long been questions as to whether it could achieve that goal, due to challenges in acquiring sufficient funding and supplies.

Developed countries have bought up most of the initial doses of the available vaccines. But even they have encountered problems in ensuring delivery. The European Union has become embroiled in a public dispute with Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca over alleged delays in vaccine delivery. Last week, the European Commission announced new restrictions that made Covid-19 vaccines manufactured in the bloc subject to export authorization -- although COVAX is excluded from the export controls.

Fisher, the expert at the National University of Singapore, said given the unprecedented scale of the vaccine project, it's bound to encounter certain setbacks.

""I don't think you would be surprised if there's some communication breakdowns, some expectations not met, and a little bit of competition and funding issues,"" he said.

""Because it's just a huge scale of hundreds of millions of -- and then billions of -- doses trying to get into the arms of 8 billion people during a pandemic. It's really complicated."""
"Another 779,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week","New York (CNN Business) Another 779,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits on a seasonally adjusted basis in the last week of January, the Labor Department said Thursday.

For yet another week, claims were nearly four times the level of the same period last year, before the pandemic brought the nation to a standstill. This underscores once again that the jobs recovery isn't in great shape as we near one year since the pandemic hit the US.

It was also the 46th straight week that initial claims were higher than they were in the worst week of the Great Recession, wrote Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute, on Twitter

Still, it was a sizable decrease in claims from the prior week and the first drop below the 800,000 mark since the start of the month. Last week's claims figure was revised down to 812,000, still several times the number during the same period last year,

On top of regular jobless benefits, 348,912 workers filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which is available for people such as the self-employed or gig workers.

Analysis: Bezos leaves behind a company that's created value but has also triggered a national reckoning,"(CNN Business) In 1997, the year Amazon ( AMZN ) became a publicly traded company, CEO Jeff Bezos promised investors they would be in for a journey. Amazon would not chase short-term profits, he warned in a letter to shareholders. It would focus ""relentlessly"" on customers. It would act with urgency but prioritize long-term investments. And it would run a lean culture that minimized costs and cut waste.

A quarter-century later, Bezos's approach has made Amazon a global behemoth that employs more than a million people and touches almost every aspect of modern life, a fact that's become even more apparent during the pandemic.

Bezos, the world's richest person until recently, has gone from selling books out of his garage to running a company that makes consumer electronics, produces award-winning films and TV shows, offers organic groceries and hosts some of the world's biggest websites. His company's ambitions include delivering packages to households using flying drones and spreading facial recognition technology to virtually every consumer's front doorstep.

With each new innovation, Bezos and Amazon have offered the promise of making life easier, more convenient and enriching for customers. But these services also became testaments to Amazon's ever-expanding power, influence and self-interest, inspiring fierce criticism from the company's opponents: that Amazon kills brick and mortar businesses ; that it bullies workers; that it uses the data from its massive online storefront to maintain a monopoly ; that its partnerships with law enforcement have made it an accessory to discriminatory policing.

""The guy was just obsessed with the end user. They were the highest priority,"" said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at George Washington University's business school. ""It's one of those situations where your biggest asset is also your biggest liability.""

Now, as he prepares to step down as CEO of the $1.7 trillion business he built and take on the role of executive chair, Bezos leaves behind a company that's created immense value for consumers, investors and many small businesses, but which has also triggered a national reckoning over the costs it may have created for everyone else.

A model for building online companies

Bezos's ambitions were large from the start: He launched Amazon at a time when few people knew what the internet was and chose the name, he later told journalist Brad Stone, in part because the Amazon river is ""not only the largest river in the world — it's many times larger than the next biggest river. It blows all other rivers away.""

To achieve his vision, Bezos frustrated some shareholders by investing heavily in the business. It wasn't until the end of 2001 that Amazon had its first profitable quarter, and its first profitable year didn't occur until 2003. Amazon would continually flirt with profitability for the next decade. This approach would become a model for many others in Silicon Valley, and perhaps even something of an excuse for cash-hungry startups that seemingly burned through money without a pathway to profit.

""Bezos created the blueprint for building internet businesses, being hyper customer-centric, and scaling disruptive innovation,"" tweeted Aaron Levie, the CEO of enterprise cloud company Box.com.

Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon after more than 25 years at the helm. He turned Amazon into a massive company by focusing on customers only to be hit by scrutiny about the broader societal costs of what he built.

No other innovation symbolized Bezos's appetite for losses like Amazon Prime, which was launched as a $79-a-year subscription plan and introduced what became the company's most recognizable offering: free two-day shipping.

On the surface, Amazon Prime stood to lose money . The cost of its benefits — which came to encompass not just fast shipping but streaming media, digital photo storage and discounts on groceries — outweighed what the company made in subscription fees. But it was another example of Bezos's long-term plan to lure new customers into Amazon's orbit and persuade them to become mega-spenders on the platform, thereby allowing Amazon to lower its costs even further to attract yet more customers, creating a virtuous cycle, or what Bezos called a ""flywheel effect."" The company last year announced it has more than 150 million Prime subscribers worldwide.

Relentless, or ruthless?

As Amazon became a bigger player in retail, it inevitably came into conflict with others, both big and small. In some cases, it effectively drove them out of business.

The bookseller Barnes and Noble announced in 2019 it was going private after a decade of trying to keep pace with Amazon. Toys""R""Us has blamed Amazon's aggressive pricing for crushing the quintessentially American toy store. Rightly or wrongly, Amazon is often listed as a contributing factor behind the so-called retail apocalypse. And these days, the mere mention of Bezos's interest in a new service is enough to send an entire industry's stocks into a downward spiral.

Like Walmart before it, Amazon has come to be viewed as ""the new big bully, at least in the internet retail space,"" said Bailey.

Amazon famously clashed with book publishers over who controlled e-book pricing. It deliberately lost money selling diapers in order to thwart Diapers.com — then, according to a landmark antitrust investigation by US lawmakers, it acquired the company before raising diaper prices. (Bezos has said he does not recall giving an order to raise prices.) Amazon's growing clout has allegedly given it immense leverage to squeeze its suppliers and to use third-party sellers' own sales data against them to gain an anti-competitive edge.

Bezos has argued that Amazon prospers not at others' expense, but rather when it helps grow the whole pie. ""Amazon's success depends overwhelmingly on the success of the thousands of small and medium-sized businesses that also sell their products in Amazon's stores,"" he told Congress.

Bezos also ruffled feathers when he held a highly publicized contest for the privilege of hosting Amazon's newest headquarters. The so-called ""HQ2"" was pitched as an engine for local job creation and economic growth, particularly to small and mid-sized cities seeking development. For months, dozens of city leaders jockeyed for Amazon's favor with offers of tax breaks and real estate. Ultimately, though, Amazon opted for Northern Virginia — just outside of Washington, D.C. — and New York, two of the nation's wealthiest and most obvious metro areas, leaving many onlookers perplexed. (It later withdrew from New York after facing backlash from members of the community.) The entire episode was a bizarre flex of Amazon's power and influence.

To some critics, the good that Bezos has created does not negate the alleged harms. On the 2020 campaign trail, figures like Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for Amazon to be broken up , and regulators are circling.

""The US and Europe are coming for Big Tech, and I don't think the lawsuits against Facebook and Google are the end of it,"" said Paul Gallant, an industry analyst at Cowen & Co.

What's good for customers isn't necessarily good for workers

Just as Bezos's growing empire raised questions about whether it was good for other businesses, it also raised questions about whether it was good for workers.

Rising automation, complaints about working conditions and a tough stance against unions all contributed to years of employee walkouts, petitions and, in some cases, lawsuits. Many of the company's white-collar workers have also protested Amazon's impact on the environment , calling on Bezos to make stepped-up commitments on climate change. ( Amazon and Bezos later pledged to do more, with Bezos committing an initial $10 billion of his own money to fight climate change.)

Early on in the pandemic, Amazon faced a warehouse worker revolt over a lack of hand sanitizer, masks and other protective gear. After one New York-based employee organized a protest over the issue, Amazon fired him for violating the company's Covid quarantine policy. Amazon has since said it's put in place temperature checks at fulfillment centers, ramped up its cleaning regimen, and established some 150 ""process changes"" to keep workers safe.

Amazon has won plaudits for increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour, but only after intense pressure from labor groups and some US lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders. And the same day that Bezos announced his plans to step down as CEO, the Federal Trade Commission said Amazon would pay more than $60 million to settle allegations that it withheld tips from its contract delivery drivers.

In the coming weeks, Amazon workers in Alabama will vote on whether to form the company's first US union. In response, Amazon has pushed for in-person voting despite the ongoing pandemic and launched a campaign to discourage unionization.

""Jeff Bezos built his multibillion-dollar empire on exploitative practices including wage theft and surveillance tactics designed to bully workers into silence and prevent them from organizing,"" said Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights group Color Of Change.

A tech icon whose reputation reflects his industry's

Despite the criticisms, Bezos will undoubtedly be remembered in the business world as a brilliant strategist and a disciplined entrepreneur.

Bill Gurley, a prominent venture capitalist, called Bezos's tenure at Amazon ""the most spectacular CEO run of my lifetime.""

In many ways, Bezos's story with Amazon mirrors that of Silicon Valley. He began with a small idea in his garage that would change the world. He was lauded for innovating his way to success, putting in hard work and taking calculated risks. But those same choices also led to claims that his company had grown too powerful for its own good, and for the good of society.

Now as allegations about Amazon's power and approach to competition may be leading to a showdown with Washington, the billionaire CEO is tapping out.

In a letter to employees this week, Bezos said he plans to spend more time on his newspaper, The Washington Post, and his spaceflight company, Blue Origin. He also plans to get more involved with his philanthropic initiatives, perhaps following in the footsteps of another transformational tech CEO — Microsoft's Bill Gates.

""Bezos wants to go out on top,"" said Gallant."
6 coronavirus vaccine scams that target your money and personal information - and what to do about them,"(CNN) Finally, the Covid-19 vaccine is available to millions, including health care workers, chronically ill people and seniors. But with wider availability comes the inevitable spike in vaccine scams.

Fraudsters are promising early access to vaccines or even a personal shipment of vaccines -- at a cost, of course. But their offers aren't legit, and those they scam could end up with their personal information exposed and money stolen without ever getting the vaccine.

Bottom line: If you're sent communication about vaccines that seems fishy, check it out with your local health department. Don't give out personal information such as your bank account information or Social Security number when solicited by someone you don't know -- no health department or vaccination site would require that information to get you vaccinated. And you should only be vaccinated at authorized vaccination sites.

SCAM: You're asked to pay for your vaccine

You won't have to pay to receive the Covid-19 vaccine when it's your turn. If you're asked to pay or provide private information, that's not legit.

You should only receive a Covid-19 vaccine at authorized vaccination sites such as hospitals, pharmacies or mass vaccination hubs such as sports arenas. If you're not sure where to find your local vaccination site, you can look them up by state through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It's possible your vaccine provider will charge you an ""administration fee"" for giving you the shot. You can be reimbursed for this fee through your insurance or, if you're not insured, through the Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund, per the CDC . If you can't afford the fee, though, you won't be turned away.

SCAM: You're offered early access for a fee

If you receive an offer to get your Covid-19 vaccine early for a fee, ignore it. No health department or vaccination site would vaccinate someone ahead of schedule if they paid for it.

The FBI warned of this scam in December 2020, and reports from the Better Business Bureau's Scam Tracker show that unknown scammers have sent unsolicited texts to random users, offering them access to the vaccine regardless of where in the vaccination schedule they fall.

SCAM: You're told to pay to put your name on a waiting list

As mentioned above, your local health department or vaccination site will not reach out to you and ask for payment to be put on a waiting list. Some vaccination sites in New York Houston and Miami have created waiting lists -- mostly for seniors who are eligible to receive their vaccines now but haven't been able to get an appointment -- but those vary by location.

Some have had better luck showing up at vaccination sites toward the end of the day in search of leftover vaccines. But if sites do have extra vaccines that must be used within a few hours, you won't be asked to pay for them.

The Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines are available to some Americans now. But if you're offered early vaccination at a price, it's likely a scam.

SCAM: You're asked to schedule appointments through unverified platforms

Unless you're certain your local health department is scheduling vaccine appointments on Eventbrite or similar platforms, you should avoid registering through sites unaffiliated with your health department or pharmacy.

Some counties are using Eventbrite to schedule vaccine appointments, but the ambiguity has made it easier for scammers to cash in. In one Florida county where health officials did not use Eventbrite, scammers made fake accounts and charged applicants to make vaccine appointments in the county anyway.

It's best to schedule an appointment through your health department or local pharmacy.

SCAM: You're told to pay to have the vaccine shipped to you

Vaccine distributors are not shipping doses of the vaccine to individuals, and you shouldn't administer the vaccine to yourself. You should only receive a vaccine at authorized vaccination sites, which you can find through your state health department or the CDC.

SCAM: You're made to take additional tests before you get a vaccine

You won't be made to take an antibody test or Covid-19 test before you receive your vaccine, so if you get texts, calls or emails that claim you should buy a test before you go, that's a scam. As reported by CNET and AARP , you don't need to undergo any additional medical tests before or during your vaccine appointment.

How to avoid getting scammed

Staying vigilant and informed is the best way to prevent scammers from accessing your money or private information.

It's best to reach out to your health care provider directly to get the facts, rather than solely interact with an unknown person through email or text. It's unlikely that a legitimate source would ask you to pay for a vaccine or visit a glitchy link.

If an unknown source asks for your Social Security number, bank account information or insurance ID, don't give it to them unless you've verified their identity with an official source, such as your health department or health care provider.

Some states begin easing restrictions as Covid-19 hospitalizations and cases decrease,"(CNN) There is some encouraging news in the fight against Covid-19 as more vaccines are being distributed and several states announced they will ease certain coronavirus restrictions amid decreasing case levels and hospitalizations, but despite the promising developments experts insist Americans need to remain cautious, especially with the arrival of differing variants in the United States.

On Thursday, Stefan Pryor, Rhode Island's Secretary of Commerce, said that starting Friday indoor dining will be allowed at 50% capacity. Catered events, he added, will allow up to 30 people indoors and 50 people outdoors with testing.

In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker said that starting Monday all businesses limited to operating within 25% capacity can raise that threshold to 40%, including restaurants.

The two states joined New Jersey, which on Wednesday announced it will ease indoor gathering limits and lift the 10 p.m. curfew for restaurants, citing decreasing Covid-19 spreading rates and hospitalization rates. Starting Friday, indoor gathering capacity limits, including for indoor dining, will be raised to 35% from 25%.

And last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that if the coronavirus positivity rate continued to decline -- as of Jan. 29 the rate was at 4.6%, the lowest since Nov. 28 -- the state could resume indoor dining at 25% capacity beginning February 14.

Additionally, 35.2 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the US, according to data published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's about about 61% of the 57,489,675 doses distributed, and it means about 8.5% of the US population -- nearly 28 million people -- have now received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.

Despite the hopeful news, experts insist Americans need to remain cautious.

The emergence of these virus mutations -- first detected in the United Kingdom ( B.1.1.7 ), South Africa ( B.1.351 ) and Brazil ( P.1 ), respectively -- could mean another surge in cases, according to Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

""What we need to do is anticipate this is coming, and I understand this is hard for the public. They're saying give me a break, I'm tired of this. But the bottom line is we have to be prepared for what I feel is certain is coming, and that's the challenge we have right now,"" Osterholm said Thursday on CNN's ""New Day.""

It will take much more than a vaccine to ""keep this variant at bay and not have potentially a major surge in just the weeks ahead,"" Osterholm said, referring to the UK variant.

New variant on the rise in Florida and California

Cases of B.1.1.7 are on the rise and could become dominant in hot spots like Florida and Southern California ""within a few weeks,"" according to the testing company Helix , which has helped identify the largest share of variant cases in the US.

The rise of B.1.1.7 is not just a product of increased genetic sequencing across the country, Helix President Dr. James Lu told CNN late Wednesday.

More than 600 cases of this variant have been found in 33 states, according to the CDC. Most are in Florida and California. The first US case was announced December 29, but the earliest known cases stretch back at least as far as mid-December.

Researchers have said that although the B.1.1.7 variant appears to be more transmissible than previous strains, it is not known to be more deadly or cause more severe disease.

The strain has also been found in at least 80 countries and territories around the globe, the World Health Organization said this week.

""The rate of growth here in Florida and Southern California looks a lot like the type of growth that we have seen previously in the UK and Denmark ... where B.1.1.7 became the predominant variant strain pretty quickly,"" Lu said.

The CDC last month said modeling showed this variant could become the US' predominant strain in March and could worsen the spread of the disease.

Rates of new coronavirus cases overall in the US have been dropping. The country has averaged about 136,900 new cases a day over the last week -- the lowest average since November 12, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

But Dr. Anthony Fauci has suggested the US isn't vaccinating people fast enough to stay ahead of new variants, and that could blunt efforts to keep bringing case levels down.

""If the variants and the mutations come, and start becoming dominant, then that's going to obviate some of the effects of the vaccine,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN this week.

Fauci told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday the best way to prevent viruses from mutating and developing is to prevent them from spreading.

""And you do that by public health measures, and getting as many people vaccinated as quickly as you possibly can because viruses will not mutate if they don't replicate,"" Fauci said. ""So if you put the lid on them and prevent them from going to person to person, you will blunt their capability of mutating.""

As for how Helix has tracked the B.1.1.7 variant, Lu referenced a small but growing number of samples showing a testing glitch, which signals the presence of a mutation in B.1.1.7. Not all of these samples are B.1.1.7, since the mutation can exist on its own.

There's been an increasing rate of this glitch -- known as S gene dropout -- in places like Florida and Southern California. And an increasing proportion of these samples are being confirmed as B.1.1.7 once they're genetically sequenced, Lu said.

""We're in a race between the vaccine and the new strains,"" Lu said. It's unclear whether the pace of vaccination will prevent the strain from taking a foothold in places where it's not already circulating, Lu added.

Helix is one of a number of commercial, academic and public health labs that share information with the CDC.

Two other strains are harder to detect, testing company says

Two other more-transmissible variants -- first identified in South Africa ( B.1.351 ) and Brazil ( P.1 ) -- have been much harder to locate, Lu told CNN Wednesday night.

That's because the mutation that causes the ""S gene dropout"" glitch that helps Helix find B.1.1.7 cases is not present in the other two strains.

Beyond appearing more transmissible, the B.1.351 and P.1 strains also contain a different mutation that scientists worry could help the virus escape some of the antibody protection from vaccines or previous infection. Even so, experts say they expect vaccines will still work against the variants -- especially when it comes to preventing severe disease and death.

""They're not detectable with our level of sampling today,"" Lu said of variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil. ""So, most of the time, if we're finding it, it's serendipity right now. But that will change, if they become more prevalent.""

Last week, the first US cases of the B.1.351 strain were found in South Carolina. According to a state health official, these two cases were found during routine sequencing, but ""the predominant strain that we are still seeing in our surveillance sequencing is the standard, or normal,"" version of the virus. Maryland has also reported a handful of cases.

At least two cases of the P.1 strain linked to Brazil have been found in the US. Both patients live in the same household in Minnesota, and one had recently traveled to Brazil, according to the state's health department.

Coronavirus deaths in US

Though daily case levels and the number of coronavirus patients in hospitals are dropping in the US, daily reports of Covid-19 deaths have been relatively high for weeks.

There have been more than 455,000 deaths in the US, with 4,805 new deaths reported Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, though more than 1,500 of the fatalities reported Thursday include backlogged deaths. This is the highest number of deaths the US has reported in a single day since the pandemic began, according to the data.

The country has averaged more than 3,080 Covid-19 deaths a day over the last week -- not far from the peak average of 3,357 on January 13, according to Johns Hopkins data. Health experts have said death tallies can be high weeks after cases surge because patients can be sick for weeks.

As health experts urge a faster pace for vaccinations to get ahead of more-transmissible variants, the United States may be inching closer to obtaining a third authorized vaccine.

Johnson & Johnson officially asked the US Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization for its one-dose vaccine candidate . If authorized, it would be the third vaccine to be allowed in the US market, joining two-dose products from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.

""Today's submission for Emergency Use Authorization of our investigational single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is a pivotal step toward reducing the burden of disease for people globally and putting an end to the pandemic,"" Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement.

The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will meet February 26 to discuss Johnson & Johnson's request for emergency use authorization.

Fauci told NBC on Wednesday he would not be surprised if the EUA for Johnson & Johnson ""happens within the next week or two.""

Fauci on Thursday tweeted that he hopes there will be data to support Covid-19 vaccinations for older children -- between 12 and 17 -- by the late spring or summer.

""We will progress to younger age groups as we have more data. This will help reduce virus transmission,"" he tweeted from the White House Covid-19 Response Team account during a question and answer session.

CORRECTION: A version of this story on Thursday morning stated that Johnson & Johnson had sought emergency use authorization for its vaccine candidate from the Food and Drug Administration. As of that time, the company had not announced such an application."
"Increasing data suggests UK variant may be deadlier, says CDC director","Workers hold placards in protest at a Food 4 Less supermarket in Long Beach, California on February 3, after a decision by owner Kroger to close two stores rather than pay workers an additional $4 in ""hazard pay"" for their continued work during the pandemic. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images

Hundreds of grocery store workers in Long Beach, California may soon be without jobs after Kroger announced it will permanently close two stores to avoid offering workers hazard pay during the pandemic.

The citywide hazard pay ordinance requires large grocers to pay their staff an extra $4 per hour for at least four months since workers face higher risk of exposure to the virus.

""It’s a slap in the face when they don’t want to pay us what we deserve, putting our lives on the front line,” said Clara Vega, general manager at one of the closing stores, a Food 4 Less supermarket. “We work so hard, we work so much overtime, it’s ridiculous.”

Local officials and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which represents 1.3 million workers, condemned Kroger's move to close the stores instead of increasing employees' pay.

""Since the pandemic began, Kroger has made billions in profits because of the sacrifices of grocery workers who have been putting their own health and safety on the line every day,"" UFCW International president Marc Perrone said in a statement.

""Rather than provide the hazard pay these grocery workers have earned and deserve, Kroger decided to threaten these workers and the community’s access to food in the middle of a public health crisis.""

Profit during the pandemic: The two stores slated for closure experienced sales increases of up to 31% since the start of the pandemic, according to Ron Herrera, president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.

Herrera said Kroger has recently seen a 90% profit increase and spent $1.4 billion in stock buybacks. CNN has reached out to Kroger for comment on its earnings.

Robert Gonzalez, a frozen food clerk at the Food 4 Less, said he was devastated to learn his store will be closing after working for Kroger for 26 years.

""After all the hard work I've done to feed the needy families and risk my life and my family's lives at home, they don't want to pay $4 extra an hour for four little months,"" Gonzalez said. ""We also give donations every week to the homeless and needy families and they want to take that away. That is so wrong and evil.""

More possible closures: Earlier this week, the cities of Los Angeles, West Hollywood, San Jose, Berkeley, San Francisco, and Oakland passed similar hazard pay ordinances. Grocery store employees in Seattle who work for a company with more than 500 employees also saw a $4 an hour hazard pay increase starting Wednesday. Kroger told CNN it was also considering additional closures in several US cities."
Missouri state lawmaker charged with selling fake stem cell treatments and claiming they are a cure for Covid-19,"(CNN) A newly elected Missouri state representative and assistant physician faces charges for allegedly running a fraud scheme in her three clinics and providing prescription drugs illegally, according to federal prosecutors.

Prosecutors in the Western District of Missouri claim that Patricia ""Tricia"" Ashton Derges, who operates three ""Ozark Valley Medical Clinic"" locations, sold what she falsely advertised as a stem cell treatment. Court documents cite one instance on April 11, 2020, when Derges wrote a Facebook post about her clinic's treatment as an ""amazing treatment (that) stands to provide a potential cure for Covid-19 patients that is safe and natural.""

However, Derges actually administered a substance called ""amniotic fluid allograft"" to patients, according to authorities . It's a substance the University of Utah told investigators it sold to her for about $244 for 1 milliliter, according to the indictment. Authorities claim Derges knew the product did not contain any cells, including stem cells. In total, Derges' patients paid her approximately $191,815.00 for amniotic fluid that did not contain stem cells, the documents say. She charged her patients $950 to $1,450 per milliliter, according to court documents.

Derges, a Republican, has pleaded not guilty, according to her attorney, Stacey Bilyeu, who stressed she is ""presumed innocent until proven guilty.""

The University of Utah said its product has clear usage instructions and was ""disappointed to learn patients were allegedly mislead."" They pledged cooperation with authorities on the investigation and said they're ""currently reviewing our processes to determine if we can do anything more to prevent similar occurrences in the future.""

A wild day that defined the Republican Party,"(CNN) Rep. Liz Cheney survived to fight another battle but on a raucous and defining day, the appeasement of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene by House Republicans sent their party lurching further down the road to extremism.

The moral crisis in the GOP after Donald Trump 's exit from Washington was epitomized by a showdown that saw Cheney, a lifelong ideological conservative, forced to fight off a challenge to her leadership post after she voted to impeach a President who sparked a violent coup attempt.

At the same time, Greene, a belligerent conspiracy theorist who thinks the GOP's problem is that it lost the presidential election too gracefully, got a pass from colleagues despite promoting a sick stew of QAnon lies and fantasies

The struggle for the future direction of the party exploded in a manic meeting of the House Republican Conference that ended when Cheney prevailed comfortably in a secret ballot -- after she refused to apologize to angry acolytes of the ex-President after choosing the Constitution over Trump.

Greene had earlier learned that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy would not strip her committee assignments -- a day after she was called into his office over her past extreme views and offensive social media posts. The Democratic-led House is however expected to act where McCarthy failed in a floor vote on Thursday.

The fact that Cheney has faced more criticism from her colleagues than Greene in recent days reflects how the GOP's traditional values are under siege and the vast power that extremists and conspiracy theories welcomed into the party by Trump are accumulating.

For weeks, and especially following the insurrection incited by Trump on January 6, the Republican Party has been locked in a prolonged duel between those swearing loyalty to their leader in exile, and others who want to move on from his anti-democratic tenure.

But Wednesday's leadership punt on Greene, a first term member from Georgia, made this clear: Scared of repudiating Trump's base, the House GOP is racing at top speed towards its extremist fringe to validate millions of Americans living in an alternative reality even if Cheney's survival suggests that privately many GOP members don't believe the election was stolen.

A 9/11 truther, who touted anti-Semitic conspiracies and expressed support for assassinations of Democratic leaders , Greene is no longer the outlier in her party across America's vast heartland -- Cheney is.

Secret ballot

Cheney, who, until the Trump insurrection, was a reliable vote for the President save on some foreign policy issues, made a powerful statement by winning in a 145 to 61 vote to keep her leadership post. Her victory was a sign that in private at least, there are some in the House Republican Party who are willing to stand up to extremism -- even if many lack the courage to do so in public. Her triumph will encourage orthodox Washington conservatives -- including many in the Senate who supported her, to think the fight for the future direction of the party is not hopeless.

But Cheney still faces the very real prospect of a primary challenge in her fervently pro-Trump state of Wyoming.

And while the lawmakers did not have to declare to their colleagues how they voted on Cheney's retention of the House Conference Chair job, it would not be surprising to see some of the most enthusiastic Trump supporters in the caucus publicly reveal their votes against her.

""This is clearly a moment to define where the party is going and the party is choosing a Hell of a path here,"" Mary Katharine Ham, a prominent conservative writer and CNN political commentator, told CNN's Anderson Cooper before Cheney's vote total was announced.

Greene said in the meeting that her past social media posts did not represent who she was. But her sense of being impervious to the customs of her fast-shifting party shone through a defiant interview with the Washington Examiner that published as Wednesday's meeting went on.

""Kevin McCarthy and all these leaders, the leadership, and everyone is proving that they are all talk and not about action, and they're just all about doing business as usual in Washington,"" Greene said.

Profound consequences

In many ways, Wednesday's meeting accelerated the direction the party has been heading at least since many parts of its traditional base became disillusioned with the establishment following years of war and the 2008 financial crisis. Trump's weaponizing of the issue of race and swift social change after Barack Obama's presidency continued the conspiratorial trend while his seditious post-election behavior removed the last restraints to an all-out embrace of extremism.

This will all have profound consequences for the country. There have always been wide, and proper, ideological differences between Democrats and Republicans. They are, if anything, widening.

But this is not a new front in the perennial duel over health care or taxes. One of America's great parties, by elevating unhinged radicals such as Greene, and by threatening those like Cheney who accept the truth of Biden's win last year, is implicitly rejecting the sacred values of the American political system itself and its essential underpinning of objective truth and fact.

Those who declared a final victory for democracy when Trump left town after his attempt to steal President Joe Biden's victory may have spoken too soon.

Weak leadership

Wednesday's turmoil also underscored how McCarthy has capitulated to the extreme forces within his caucus and in the country. A week after his pilgrimage to make up with Trump after his tepid criticism of his role inciting the Capitol insurrection, the leader refused to strip Greene of her committee posts.

The spectacle of the leader being led around by a congresswoman who has been in Washington for four weeks either showed great political weakness or cynical calculation. He will leave it to House Democrats to rebuke Greene. While that makes McCarthy look feckless, it also suggests he concluded that it is better for him politically for Democrats to punish a Make America Great Again hero than for his caucus to alienate their base.

Yet his failure to deal with the Greene issue himself means that many of his members -- especially those from more vulnerable districts -- now face a choice between voting in the full House to punish a Trump supporter or to open themselves to accusations they are endorsing her crazed rhetoric.

McCarthy condemned Greene's social media activity in a statement and accused Democrats of not meeting him half way on finding a solution that would have reallocated Greene's committee posts. (Critics had complained she was placed on an education committee, following her claims that several school massacres were ""false flag operations."")

But he also stated that he took Greene at her word that she now recognized that her conduct as a member of Congress needed to be of a higher standard than when she was a private citizen.

""The voters decided that she can come and serve,"" McCarthy said after the meeting, adding that Greene had denounced her own social media activity.

In her comments to the Examiner, in which she again alluded to lies that Trump won the election and insulted Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell, Greene showed she has no incentive to reform her behavior.

""Now, we have Joe Biden in the White House and Nancy Pelosi at 80 million years old as speaker, and we've got a Senate that we don't control anymore, with, you know, Mr. Big Turtle in charge up there just, just losing gracefully, losing gracefully,"" Greene said in the interview.

GOP senators set to avoid moral choice

Local activists and other outliers in Washington such as Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger might argue that all is not lost for the GOP and that the reckoning will take many months, as memories fade of the Trump presidency.

But many of those state Republican officials who stood firm in the face of the ex-President's attempt to overturn election results are facing the similar kind of assaults and likely primary challenges as Cheney and the other nine House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump.

And Republican senators, such as McConnell, who called Greene a ""cancer,"" and others who condemned her remarks would insist that they are standing up for the institutional values of the party that saved the world for democracy by winning the Cold War against communism.

Yet in the next few weeks, the vast majority of GOP senators are expected to vote to acquit Trump in his Senate impeachment trial. Most will take refuge in a questionable constitutional conceit that the trial is moot since Trump is an ex-President.

This will spare them having to wrestle with the moral choice of what to do with a commander in chief who sent his supporters on a deadly march on another branch of government. Their motivation is the same as those who are appeasing Greene -- a desire to avoid antagonizing the party base and to avoid primary challenges in order to retain their hold on power."
It may get so bitterly cold after this week's blizzard in the Midwest that engine antifreeze would solidify,"(CNN) The blizzard blasting parts of the Midwest on Thursday is a curtain-raiser for a cold snap that people won't soon forget.

A ""flash freeze"" could accompany this storm as temperatures drop rapidly below freezing, making for very dangerous conditions.

A flash freeze happens when rapidly falling temperatures ""quickly turn any wet or slushy roads to ice,"" the National Weather Service office in Des Moines, Iowa, noted, warning it will likely create significant travel problems Thursday across the Hawkeye State.

Widespread snowfall will continue across the Midwest through Saturday. Blizzard conditions are likely for north central Iowa. More significant accumulations exceeding 12"" are possible from northeastern Wisconsin into the Michigan Upper Peninsula and western lower Michigan. pic.twitter.com/KFtV0X1dwf

The arctic chill won't spare the rest of the country either. By Monday morning, 212 million Americans -- roughly 67% of the country -- will experience temperatures below freezing. This includes every state in the Lower 48.

The cold trend, which will affect states as far south as Louisiana, will continue for the next 10 days.

Blizzard sets the stage for extreme cold

Strong winds, blowing snow and rapidly falling temperatures are expected Thursday and Friday from Nebraska to Michigan as over 35 million people are under winter weather alerts.

Blizzard warnings are in place across central and northern Iowa through Friday morning, while winter storm warnings and advisories stretch farther east to Chicago and Detroit.

The criteria for blizzard conditions do not necessarily require snow to be falling. The technical definition requires sustained winds of at least 35 mph and poor visibility, frequently to less than one quarter of a mile (this could be caused by falling and/or blowing snow). Both requirements must last for at least three hours.

As with this storm, only moderate accumulations are forecast, ranging from 2 to 5 inches in Des Moines and up to 8 inches in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Higher totals can be expected downwind from Lake Michigan in favored lake-effect areas, where up to a foot of snow is possible.

Ahead of the system, a wintry mix of rain and snow is forecast as temperatures briefly surge before dramatically falling behind the cold front.

Winds are forecast to gust over 45 mph, blowing snow and reducing visibilities under a quarter mile across parts of Iowa. As the mercury drops and the snow begins to drift over roadways, conditions will deteriorate at a moment's notice.

Waterloo, Mason City and Fort Dodge are all predicted to experience ""extreme"" travel impacts from this potent storm, according to the NWS hazards matrix.

A lot of questions about timing of the worst impacts with the Winter Storm. Here is a graphic to provide you an idea. Keep in mind, most of Thursday is just going to be bad. pic.twitter.com/OUhNeLAsGV — NWS Des Moines (@NWSDesMoines) February 3, 2021

Still, high snow totals won't be the biggest threat from this storm. The real showstopper will be the cold air settling in early next week.

A flash freeze is on the way

The coldest air will start diving on Saturday south through the upper Midwest and Great Lakes. Places in central Wisconsin could see temperatures plummet to minus 25 degrees on Sunday morning, with high temperatures struggling to make it to zero. Overnight lows could be cold enough for car antifreeze to solidify.

""We get two to three of these cold snaps every year,"" said meteorologist Marcia Cronce from the National Weather Service Office in Milwaukee. ""We are heading into the coldest air of the season, it will feel jolting.""

""As temperatures fall some 25 to 30 degrees below seasonal averages, parts of the Upper Midwest will near the thresholds necessary to cancel, or in the case of 2021, virtualize classes,"" said CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri

Schools in St. Paul, Minnesota, cancel classes if the 6 a.m. forecast for the following day is minus 25 or wind chills are forecast to drop to below 35.

Another concern is how the bitter cold air will affect the flow of water and traffic on the major rivers in the Midwest.

""Areas to our south -- the lower portions of the upper Mississippi and the Illinois River -- are seeing relatively decent flows and levels are good for navigation, especially around St. Louis, but extreme cold outbreaks give us a concern for ice bites, which takes flow out of the river,"" said Justin Palmer, a hydrologist with the North Central River Forecast Center in Chanhassen, Minnesota.

""Ice gets created in the pools, we drop a lot of flow, which drops stages and becomes an issue for potential groundings. On the Illinois River, however, with this extreme push of cold air we could potentially see some ice form, but overall were seeing good traffic in St. Louis and believe this year the rivers have been more open with this warmer year.""

Ice bite events are associated with frigid cold weather. Ice formation in rivers often causes reductions in flow downstream, which drops water levels , making them unnavigable. This can have a significant impact at St. Louis, leading to low water levels that ground navigation and expose water intakes.

After the snow on Thursday, the coldest air of the season is looking to settle into southern WI this weekend. #swiwx pic.twitter.com/rcMxQ3uaCH — NWS Milwaukee (@NWSMilwaukee) February 2, 2021

It's not just the Midwest that will be seeing this deep freeze. Southern states like Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi will be 15 to 30 degrees below normal Tuesday and Wednesday.

The polar vortex is coming

This frigid cold is compliments of the polar vortex , a large area of low pressure located near the poles. During the winter months it breaks down, sending cold air that has been bottled up. It can be responsible for extremely frigid temperatures and huge plunges of cold air.

The polar vortex has been weakened even more so this year by the Sudden Stratospheric Warming events that occur about six times a decade

This will cause the polar vortex to weaken even further, making for bitterly cold conditions."
Top Tokyo Olympics organizing official apologizes for sexist remarks that women talk too much in meetings,"Tokyo (CNN) Yoshiro Mori, the president of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee, apologized Thursday after comments he made suggesting women talk too much during meetings were leaked to the Japanese media.

Mori, a former Prime Minister, made the comments at an Olympics board of trustees event Wednesday. When asked about the Japan Olympic Committee's goal of increasing the number of women on its board of directors from 20% to 40%, Mori said he was concerned about how that would affect the length of meetings.

He reportedly said ""board meetings with lots of women take longer"" because ""women are competitive -- if one member raises their hand to speak, others might think they need to talk too,"" according to reports in the Japanese press. ""If you want to increase female membership, you would be in trouble unless you put time limits in place,"" he is reported to have added.

Speaking at a news conference Thursday, 83-year-old Mori confirmed he made the remarks behind closed doors and said he was sorry for doing so.

""I recognize my comment yesterday was an inappropriate expression and went against the spirit of the Olympics and Paralympics. I profoundly regret it,"" he said. ""I'd like to withdraw my comment and apologize to the people whom I made to feel unpleasant.""

Commercial pilots blame pandemic downtime for in-flight mistakes,"(CNN) — The steepest downturn in modern aviation history means plenty of airline pilots are spending weeks or months of the coronavirus pandemic idling at home.

When they do return to the cockpit, a few are admitting that they're out of practice, and knocking off the rust is proving harder than anticipated.

""This was my first flight in nearly 3 months,"" one pilot wrote in a June report explaining why he or she neglected to turn on the critical anti-icing system. ""I placed too much confidence in assuming that it would all come back to me as 'second nature.'""

The report on that flight, which landed without incident, is one of more than two dozen documenting the challenges of returning from pandemic-related leave filed in a federal system for tracking aviation mistakes.

A CNN analysis of the publicly available reports, which were highlighted in a recent report by the Los Angeles Times , found returning pilots acknowledging their skills were not as sharp as they expected.

The idea behind the NASA-run Aviation Safety Reporting System is that coming clean about errors allows for analysis and improvements that make aviation safer. The reports are stripped of identifying information -- such as which airline and which airports were involved -- and made public in a government database.

""Everyone knows that flying skills and company policies/procedures are highly diminishable,"" the pilot wrote in the anti-icing report. ""In order to prepare for a flight following a period of inactivity I should have dedicated more time to review my duties.""

Airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration do have systems in place to require pilots keep in practice. The pilot nearing three months without a flight was fast approaching a federal rule that requires additional training for pilots who aren't active enough over a 90-day period.

The risk, aviation safety expert Peter Goelz says, is that aviation disasters are often at the end of a chain that begins with a simple mistake.

""These kinds of fairly mundane -- what appear to be mundane -- errors can really result in terrible events,"" said Goelz, who is a CNN aviation analyst and former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates crashes.

'Boy was I wrong'

One of the most serious issues identified in the reports was a plane that landed without permission from air traffic controllers. The pilots of that flight were overwhelmed with turbulence and other distractions while approaching the airport, one of the pilots wrote, and they ""forgot to obtain the landing clearance.""

""Since COVID-19 breakout, I was not flying as frequently as before,"" that pilot wrote. ""I believe this was factored into this incident.""

Several pilots reported drifting from their assigned altitude, and one documented aiming for the wrong runway -- decisions that, had another plane been nearby, could have led to a collision.

One said that after a smooth first flight in several months, he or she was surprised to make a mistake managing the airplane's speed.

""I thought I was through the danger of being rusty, boy was I wrong,"" the pilot wrote. ""I wrongly figured I had knocked the rust off ... when the first leg went so well.""

Several pilots reported incorrectlry programming flight computers or radios. One captain who reported dialing in the wrong frequency while approaching an airport said he or she ""hadn't flown for two months;"" in the other seat was a colleague who ""hadn't flown for 6 weeks.""

""I struggle to see a viable remedy for this problem besides just flying more, which the current situation may or may not allow soon,"" the captain wrote. ""We definitely need to be more aware of how much our proficiency decreases as we are flying less.""

Refresher training

On any given day, about 400 pilots filter through American Airlines' training programs. Preparation for mock flights in massive flight simulators begins before the sun rises, and the final simulated landings take place after midnight.

Jim Thomas, a captain with 35 years of experience who now leads flight training and standards at American, said his team is no stranger to pilots returning from leaves of absence. Some pilots spend time away from the cockpit for medical or personal reasons, and others return to the company after being called up for military service.

""Where we would normally be training long-course pilots to learn new aircraft, in this case we're getting them requalified,"" Thomas told CNN in an interview. ""We're not going to allow them to go fly the line until they're fully trained and ready to go fly.""

At a facility in Dallas, and another in Charlotte, North Carolina, pilots file into classrooms for instruction, and into simulators to practice their skills. In one classroom, an instructor walked pilots through slides about programming the flight director computer. Nearby, pilots were flying scenarios in the simulator -- large rooms propped up on hydraulic legs that look, from the outside, like white space capsules.

Curtis Joens is an American captain who recently returned from a four-month leave of absence -- the first of his three-decade career. Joens said that as a more senior pilot, he took some time away from the job to give lower-ranked pilots an opportunity to keep flying.

Joens said he studied before brushing up on his skills at the training center. He said one instructor commented after a simulator ride that his time away from the cockpit wasn't noticeable.

Key to safe flight, Joens said, is the methodical way pilots approach their work.

""We don't just sit down and say, 'OK, start engines,' and fly by the seat of our pants,"" he told CNN. ""There's a checklist and a methodology for everything that we do, all the way from the preflight to starting engines, to taxi, to takeoff.""

American analyzed its pilots and insists the pandemic has not led to a decline in their skills.

Joens also said pilots have a conversation before the flight to talk about any concerns, which would include time away from the job. ""Just realize you've got two pilots up there, they're supporting one another, they're watching one another, they're challenging one another,"" he said."
Myanmar cuts Facebook access as military tightens grip following coup,"Hong Kong (CNN) Internet and news services continued to be disrupted across Myanmar on Thursday, as the country's military sought to secure their grip on power after deposing the democratically-elected government earlier this week.

Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's de facto leader, along with President Win Myint and dozens of other senior figures in their National League for Democracy (NLD) were detained in pre-dawn raids Monday. Hours later, the military declared that power had been handed to commander in chief Min Aung Hlaing, in response to unfounded allegations of election fraud. A state of emergency was declared for one year.

Late Wednesday, an arrest warrant was issued for Suu Kyi over unspecified ""import and export"" offenses, while Win Myint was remanded in custody under the country's Disaster Management Law, according to an NLD spokesman.

While the dramatic overthrow of Suu Kyi's government attracted international attention, continued disruptions to internet access and communications mean that many in Myanmar may still be unclear about what is taking place.

Facebook, by far the largest online platform in the country, confirmed to CNN that its services were ""currently disrupted for some people"" as of Thursday morning, as independent monitors recorded widespread filtering of Facebook, WhatsApp and other platforms, even as basic internet access was returning in some areas.

Limited access to news and internet could affect the ability of people to get information or organize any response via social media. At one point on Monday, the only operational TV channel was the Myanmar military-owned television network Myawaddy TV. By Wednesday, some channels, such as DVB TV, were still off the air.

Speaking Wednesday, US State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington was ""disturbed"" by reports of an arrest warrant being issued for Suu Kyi.

""We call on the military to immediately release ... all detained civilian and political leaders, journalists, and detained human rights activists and to restore the democratically elected government to power,"" Price said, adding that President Joe Biden viewed the military's actions as a ""direct assault on the country's transition to democracy and the rule of law.""

Military in control

For more than 50 years, Myanmar -- also known as Burma -- was run by successive isolationist military regimes that plunged the country into poverty and brutally stifled any dissent. Thousands of critics, activists, journalists, academics and artists were routinely jailed and tortured during that time.

Suu Kyi shot to international prominence during her decades-long struggle against military rule. When her party, the NLD, won a landslide in elections in 2015 and formed the first civilian government, many pro-democracy supporters hoped it would mark a break from the military rule of the past and offer hope that Myanmar would continue to reform.

The NLD was widely reported to have won another decisive victory in a November 2020 general election, giving it another five years in power and dashing hopes for some military figures that an opposition party they had backed might take power democratically.

The sudden seizure of power came as the new parliament was due to open and after months of increasing friction between the civilian government and the powerful military, known as the Tatmadaw, over alleged election irregularities. The country's election commission has repeatedly denied mass voter fraud took place.

Hundreds of NLD lawmakers were detained in the capital Naypyitaw Monday, where they had traveled to take up their seats. The junta has since removed 24 ministers and deputies from government and named 11 of its own allies as replacements who will assume their roles in a new administration.

Analysts have suggested the coup was more likely to do with the military attempting to reassert its power and the personal ambition of army chief Min Aung Hlaing, who was set to step down this year, rather than serious claims of voter fraud.

""Facing mandatory retirement in a few months, with no route to a civilian leadership role, and amid global calls for him to face criminal charges in The Hague, he was cornered,"" Jared Genser, an international human rights lawyer who previously served as pro bono counsel to Suu Kyi, wrote for CNN this week.

Protests and strikes

So far, resistance to the coup has been relatively limited, both in part due to communications difficulties, and long memories of previous brutal crackdowns by the military, while ruled the country with an iron-grip for so long.

Doctors have pledged to go on strike, despite the coronavirus pandemic which is still dogging Myanmar, and there have been scattered calls for protests and work stoppages issued online, some in the name of the NLD.

Assistant Doctors at Yangon General Hospital released a statement pledging their participation in the ""civil disobedience movement,"" saying they will not work under a military led government and called for Suu Kyi's release.

Video showed medical workers in Yangon outside the hospital Wednesday dressed in their scrubs and protective gear, while wearing red ribbons.

Myanmar's Ministry of Information warned the media and public Tuesday not to spread rumors on social media or incite unrest, urging people to cooperate with the government following Monday's coup.

""Some media and public are spreading rumors on social media conducting gatherings to incite rowdiness and issuing statements which can cause unrest,"" the statement read. ""We would like to urge the public not to carry out these acts and would like to notify the public to cooperate with the government in accordance with the existing laws.""

Fear of the military could be a powerful preventative against concerted action.

""When the military was last in charge, political prisoners like me were rounded up, sent to prison for decades, (put in) solitary confinement and tortured. We are concerned that if this state of emergency is not reversed, similar things will happen again,"" said Bo Kyi, co-founder of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, and a former detainee himself.

""There is a fear that the military could continue persecuting officials, activists and crack down on ordinary people. But we have hope that Burma can return on its democratic path."""
Prisoners in Massachusetts are getting their Covid-19 vaccines -- and reduced sentences,"(CNN) Prisoners in Massachusetts have a special incentive to get the Covid-19 vaccine.

If they receive both doses, watch and read educational materials and submit a form for approval, they could shorten their sentence, the Department of Corrections said in a memo.

The incentive is made possible by a Massachusetts law , which states that prisoners are ""eligible to earn deductions from sentences and completion credits, collectively known as good conduct deductions, for participation in and completion of programs and activities"" outlined in the law.

That's what Department of Correction Commissioner Carol A. Mici described as ""earned good time"" (EGT) in a January 28 memo addressed to inmates/patients.

Prisoners who complete the required steps are eligible for a total of seven and a half days of EGT, according to the memo

""I have determined that receiving the vaccine is significantly valuable to rehabilitation and will therefore be offering Earned Good Time,"" Mici wrote.

Prisons remain hot spots for Covid-19

Massachusetts is one of only a few states including prisoners in Phase One of its vaccine distribution rollouts.

As of January 28, when the memo was sent out, over 3,500 DOC inmates had received the vaccine, Mici wrote.

Prisons have been hot spots for virus infection from the early days of the pandemic.

According to the Covid Prison Project , which monitors Covid-19 in correctional facilities across the US, there have been 368,271 Covid-19 cases and 2,256 related deaths among incarcerated people to date.

""If we just purely look at the epidemiology of Covid-19 where the outbreaks have been, it's really hard to ignore jails and prisons,"" Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, an assistant professor of social medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and co-founder of the project, told CNN last month. ""They've really been the epicenter in many ways.""

In December , over 480 health experts signed an open letter urging the CDC advisory group to prioritize incarcerated populations for vaccinations.

Virginia also offers incentives to prisoners

Massachusetts is not the only state to offer incentives to prisoners eligible for vaccination.

The Virginia Department of Corrections announced on January 21 that inmates who receive the vaccine will get ""free email stamps and telephone credits"" along with packages of commissary items, like snacks.

Incentives besides EGT in Massachusetts have not been announced."
"February 3, 2021 coronavirus news","Workers hold placards in protest at a Food 4 Less supermarket in Long Beach, California on February 3, after a decision by owner Kroger to close two stores rather than pay workers an additional $4 in ""hazard pay"" for their continued work during the pandemic. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images

Hundreds of grocery store workers in Long Beach, California may soon be without jobs after Kroger announced it will permanently close two stores to avoid offering workers hazard pay during the pandemic.

The citywide hazard pay ordinance requires large grocers to pay their staff an extra $4 per hour for at least four months since workers face higher risk of exposure to the virus.

""It’s a slap in the face when they don’t want to pay us what we deserve, putting our lives on the front line,” said Clara Vega, general manager at one of the closing stores, a Food 4 Less supermarket. “We work so hard, we work so much overtime, it’s ridiculous.”

Local officials and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which represents 1.3 million workers, condemned Kroger's move to close the stores instead of increasing employees' pay.

""Since the pandemic began, Kroger has made billions in profits because of the sacrifices of grocery workers who have been putting their own health and safety on the line every day,"" UFCW International president Marc Perrone said in a statement.

""Rather than provide the hazard pay these grocery workers have earned and deserve, Kroger decided to threaten these workers and the community’s access to food in the middle of a public health crisis.""

Profit during the pandemic: The two stores slated for closure experienced sales increases of up to 31% since the start of the pandemic, according to Ron Herrera, president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.

Herrera said Kroger has recently seen a 90% profit increase and spent $1.4 billion in stock buybacks. CNN has reached out to Kroger for comment on its earnings.

Robert Gonzalez, a frozen food clerk at the Food 4 Less, said he was devastated to learn his store will be closing after working for Kroger for 26 years.

""After all the hard work I've done to feed the needy families and risk my life and my family's lives at home, they don't want to pay $4 extra an hour for four little months,"" Gonzalez said. ""We also give donations every week to the homeless and needy families and they want to take that away. That is so wrong and evil.""

More possible closures: Earlier this week, the cities of Los Angeles, West Hollywood, San Jose, Berkeley, San Francisco, and Oakland passed similar hazard pay ordinances. Grocery store employees in Seattle who work for a company with more than 500 employees also saw a $4 an hour hazard pay increase starting Wednesday. Kroger told CNN it was also considering additional closures in several US cities."
"Younger adults are biggest spreaders of Covid-19, study suggests","(CNN) A new study suggests that the biggest spreaders of coronavirus in the US are adults aged 20 to 49, but that doesn't mean they should be pushed to the head of the vaccine line, experts say.

A research team at Imperial College in London used cell phone location data covering more than 10 million people and publicly available information on the spread of the virus to calculate which age groups were most responsible for the spread of the virus across most of the US.

Children accounted for very little spread, the researchers said, as did older adults. This could mean that opening schools may not contribute to spread if transmission is controlled among younger adults, they said.

""This study provides evidence that the resurgent COVID-19 epidemics in the US in 2020 have been driven by adults aged 20-49, and in particular adults aged 35-49, before and after school reopening,"" the team wrote in their report, published in the journal Science.

""Unlike pandemic flu, these adults accounted after school reopening in October, 2020 for an estimated 72.2% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US locations considered, whereas less than 5% originated from children aged 0-9 and less than 10% from teens aged 10-19.""

And it might be the adults aged 35 to 49 who are the biggest factor in driving the pandemic, as opposed to younger adults, Oliver Ratmann of the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team and colleagues concluded.

""Prior to the implementation of COVID-19 interventions, contacts concentrated among individuals of similar age, were highest among school-aged children and teens, and also common between children/teens and their parents, and middle-aged adults and the elderly. Since the beginning of the pandemic, these contact patterns have changed substantially,"" the team wrote.

""This study indicates that in locations where novel highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 lineages have not yet established, additional interventions among adults aged 20-49, such as mass vaccination with transmission-blocking vaccines, could bring resurgent COVID-19 epidemics under control and avert deaths,"" they added.

They estimated that people 35 to 49 accounted for 41% of the new transmissions through mid-August, and adults 20 to 34 were responsible for another 35%. Children and teens accounted for just 6% of spread. People 50 to 64 made up 15% of transmission.

""Over time, the share of age groups among reported deaths has been remarkably constant, suggesting that young adults are unlikely to have been the primary source of resurgent epidemics since summer 2020, and that instead changes in mobility and behavior among the broader group of adults aged 20-49 underlie resurgent COVID-19 in the US in 2020,"" the team wrote.

Efforts to control virus spread

The researchers said that efforts to control the spread of coronavirus -- including vaccination -- should probably focus on those aged 20 to 49.

But there is not yet enough vaccine to immunize everyone, and the federal government is working with state and local governments to try to vaccinate people in an orderly, fair and logical way.

Current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance put frontline healthcare workers and frail long term care facility residents at the front of the vaccine line. The White House under both presidents Trump and Biden has suggested that states open up vaccination to anyone over 65, as this age group is considered most vulnerable to death and severe disease from Covid-19.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday that while older people are more at risk for severe disease, experts have suspected for some time that younger people are driving the spread of the virus in the US.

Fauci did not discount the idea that the US should ensure those aged 20 to 49 get vaccinated but noted that it should not come at the expense of vaccinating older people, especially those with underlying health conditions.

""You don't want to deprive them to get the younger ones, because they're the ones that are going to wind up in the hospital and have a higher rate of death,"" Fauci told CNN's Don Lemon. ""What we don't want to do is to neglect them.""

Dr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine at George Washington University and CNN medical analyst, said that while it's important to vaccinate older people, younger adults should not necessarily be at the back of the line.

""I've thought for a while now that the priority groups just aren't working and that we have to open it up to everyone,"" Reiner told CNN's Jake Tapper Wednesday.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""Now we can set aside, perhaps, a larger percentage of the vaccines for older Americans, but I think we need to start getting the vaccine out into younger people for exactly this reason -- the younger people are the people who are spreading the virus,"" Reiner added.

The Moderna and Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines currently available in the US provide protection against severe disease, though it is unclear whether they prevent transmission of the virus.

Researchers have suggested that the type of protection provided by vaccines may have some role in decisions about who should get a vaccine and when.

""Ultimately, everyone has to be vaccinated,"" said Reiner. ""And if you end up vaccinating older people, you'll save their lives because they're at higher risk. And if you vaccinate younger people, you'll save lives also because they're spreading the virus."""
States take back hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses held in federal long-term care program,"(CNN) Hundreds of thousands of Covid-19 vaccine doses are shifting to states after they weren't used by the federal program to vaccinate long-term care facility residents and staff. The doses had been set aside for a federal partnership between the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Walgreens and CVS, which were vaccinating people in facilities in most states. CNN has counted at least 266,675 doses in 10 states -- Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia. That is equal to about 8% of the number of people who have been administered at least one dose through the federal program. Three states that responded to CNN -- Alabama, Delaware and Hawaii -- said they had no reallocations from the care facility programs at the moment. Both Georgia and Maryland told CNN they intend to reallocate any excess doses but were unsure of how many they would transfer at the moment.

Residents and staff of long-term care facilities were among the very first prioritized by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to receive Covid-19 vaccines. According to the CDC, less than 1% of America's population lives in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Yet, this population represents about 39% of all Covid-19 deaths.

The US vaccine rollout got off to a slow start, but the federal long-term care partnership has been the target of particular criticism for it's slow pace.

""The states are frustrated,"" said Claire Hannan, executive director for the Association of Immunization Managers.

Hannan pointed to slower than expected uptake among long-term care staff members and an over estimation of the number of doses it needed. Retail pharmacists were unfamiliar with working with this population -- for example, requiring consents from people who may be unable to consent for themselves.

""This shouldn't be the 'Hunger Games' like it was with PPE, right. That was ridiculous and we all had to play that game,"" said Utah Governor Spencer Cox in a press briefing last month.

""That Walgreens and CVS partnership with the federal government, that's where all the backlog is in every state right now,"" added Cox.

'The last thing we would do was ... hold it'

Both CVS and Walgreens acknowledge there was an overestimation of how many doses may be needed.

To determine what was set aside for the long-term pharmacy program, they took the number of beds in each participating facility and multiplied by two in order to account for staffing, too. According to the CDC, the federal partnership covers more than 70,000 long-term care facilities nationwide.

In addition, the pharmacy chains both cited higher than expected vaccine hesitancy among care facility staff members.

In an email to CNN, the CDC said that in the initial weeks of the rollout the agency ""required that jurisdictions allocate ample vaccine supply to support efforts to schedule vaccination clinics at (long term care facilities) nationwide and avoid any interruptions or delays in those onsite vaccination efforts. ""

On Tuesday, Walgreen's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kevin Ban told CNN's Chris Cuomo, ""We found ourselves in a situation where we had more vaccine than we needed -- the last thing we would do was ever hold it -- and so immediately what we did was get in touch with the states to make sure that we were compliant with their wishes.

""Walgreens does not determine who gets vaccinated, we're the last mile of this, we're the ones who actually distribute and administer it, but only based on state eligibility,"" added Ban.

In a statement to CNN, CVS said, ""In most cases these 'excess doses' aren't in our possession, but rather earmarked from state allocations. We want shots in arms as urgently as the states do, so in some cases we're proactively asking that they 'reclaim' allocation we won't need, or defer making more allocations as appropriate. ""

But the federal program reported directly to the CDC, and states say they were often in the dark about progress at long-term care facilities, said Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.

""Our health departments didn't have a significant amount of awareness of anything that was going on the parallel tracks to hospitals or pharmacies, and that's really not the way we want to run a public health emergency response,"" said Freeman.

In a call with governors last week, Biden administration officials told states that they should be reallocating vaccines that had been earmarked for the federal program that hadn't been used within a week of delivery.

And on Monday, Andy Slavitt, a senior adviser to the the White House Covid-19 response team, said the administration continues to ensure that doses are allocated to people who will use them.

""We have been working with states and with those distributors to make sure that those excess doses quickly get to the places that there needed when they exist,"" he said.

Doses begin to head back to the states

Last week, Utah reallocated 28,275 doses back into the hands of the state to be redistributed.

Already, the states of Arkansas and New Jersey are taking back 30,000 doses each. New Jersey has also stopped the delivery of 44,000 doses that had been allocated to the federal program. The state of New York is reallocating 50,000 doses.

In a letter posted to Twitter on Friday, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster announced that the state was reallocating 37,800 doses to vaccine providers in the state.

""These surplus vaccines should be made available to members of the general public right away rather than at the completion of the LTC program,"" McMaster wrote.

The CDC told CNN at least 24 such transfers have been approved, but states and jurisdictions can work directly with the pharmacies to redistribute vaccine as needed. Some states have already received their doses to distribute among other groups eligible for vaccine.



One state, West Virginia, opted out of the federal partnership entirely. Instead, it utilized the established relationships it already had with local pharmacies to distribute the vaccine.

It has consistently been one of the leading states in terms of the share of distributed doses that have been administered. According to the CDC, West Virginia has administered 82% of the doses it has received, putting the state second after North Dakota. Nationally, the rate is about 61%.

West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said states ""need to get the bureaucratic thinking out of the system.""

Justice has suggested a ""common sense"" approach to vaccine distribution, focused on vaccinating older people first and making the vaccine available at places people are familiar with, including local pharmacies and local health clinics.

""You have to take this to the people,"" he said.

This week, the Biden administration announced it will be put 1 million doses toward the first phase of the retail pharmacy program -- a similar partnership between the federal government and retail pharmacies, but this time geared towards vaccinating the general public.

NACCHO's Freeman says she hopes that the there will be clearer communication between the federal government and local health officials this time around.

""We could run the risk here again with the federal pharmacy program about to be rolled out ... if we don't ensure that we have some transparency and awareness,"" she said."
"Global Covid-19 vaccine confidence is rising, survey shows","(CNN) Global vaccine confidence is rising, according to a survey released Wednesday showing that 54% of respondents across 15 countries would get a Covid-19 vaccine if one was offered to them.

The survey done by the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College in London showed that willingness to get vaccinated has increased in 11 of the 15 countries since November, when 41% of respondents said they would get vaccinated.

""It is very encouraging to see that, as a number of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines are being rolled out across the world, there has been an apparent positive shift in people's perceptions of these products,"" Dr. David Nabarro, co-director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College in London, said in a statement.

About 13,500 people were surveyed each of four times between November and mid-January. Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom were included in the analysis.

The US was not included in the Imperial College survey, but a CNN poll, also conducted in mid-January, found that 66% of Americans say they would get a Covid-19 vaccine, up from 51% in October.

Frank Biden's actions already testing Joe Biden's ethics claims,"(CNN) President Joe Biden said at the start of his administration that family conflicts of interest would not be tolerated in his White House, but not two weeks into his presidency, his brother's actions as a part of his employment at a law firm in Florida are raising questions about how he'll implement that pledge.

Francis ""Frank"" Biden, the President's brother, was hired as a non-attorney, senior adviser for Berman Law Group, a Boca Raton law firm in 2018. The firm frequently touts Frank Biden's ties to the President, featuring Frank and his family connections prominently on their website, in ads and on social media.

As Frank Biden was with his brother in Washington for the inauguration last month, the firm placed a two-page ""advertorial"" in a local Florida newspaper emphasizing the shared values between ""the two Biden brothers."" With Frank Biden's image placed prominently in the center of the ad, it also mentioned the firm's lawsuit against sugar cane growers ""filed against the backdrop of incoming President Joseph Biden Jr.'s commitment to environmental and social justice(.)""

Last week, the White House said that it is its policy to not let businesses imply they have Biden's support or endorsement. But they declined to comment on the record specifically about the advertisement.

On Wednesday, a White House official told CNN that there is currently a process in place that involves the White House Counsel's Office and family representatives to address issues as they may arise any questions of potential conflicts of interest."
California boosts vaccination effort as part of federal pilot program,"(CNN) California is opening two mass Covid-19 vaccination sites as part of a federal pilot program to quickly boost the number of available doses, as the state continues to see improving numbers in cases, deaths, positivity rate and hospitalizations.

""Everything that should be up in relationship to this virus is up. Everything that should be down is down,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news conference at Oakland Coliseum, one of the vaccination sites opening soon.

The rolling average of new daily cases in the state has dropped in half in the past two weeks, according to data from California's Department of Public Health. The state added 10,501 new cases and 481 Covid-19 related deaths Wednesday, and hospitalizations have dropped 30% over the last 14 days.

California State University, Los Angeles will house the other new vaccination site. Both locations are part of the 100 sites planned nationwide in a federal-state partnership. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide personal protective equipment and supplies, according to Newsom.

California is now administering about 1 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine each week, Newsom said, a rate two to three times higher than the initial rollout. The state is trying to speed up inoculations and jump start its economy as it emerges from a regional stay-at-home order that shuttered many nonessential businesses.

"Navy has fallen short in addressing lack of diversity, task force says","(CNN) The Navy's efforts to improve equality have clearly fallen short of ""addressing the societal challenges of today,"" a military task force created following the nation's racial reckoning found.

Task Force One Navy issued dozens of recommendations on Wednesday after months of evaluating the military branch's diversity and inclusion practices.

""We have fallen short in the past by excluding or limiting opportunity for people on the basis of race, sexual orientation, sexual identity, gender or creed,"" Adm. Michael Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said in a statement.

""Our Navy must continue to remove barriers to service, and most importantly, be a shining example of a workforce centered on respect, inclusive of all. Simply put, all Sailors -- uniformed and civilian - and applicants for accession to the Navy must be treated with dignity and respect above all else.""

While diversity within the Navy ranks has improved over the past 20 years and is slightly better than America's demographics, the task force said, the organization must develop more leaders of color.

Secretary of Defense orders all military to pause and review handling of extremism in ranks,"(CNN) Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has ordered a staggered pause of operations across the entire US military so commanders can have ""needed discussions"" with service members about the issue of extremism over the next 60 days, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby announced on Wednesday.

Austin hopes the pause, known as a stand down, will accomplish two things -- he wants leaders of each branch to be able to communicate their expectations of how their troops should behave, and leaders to ""gain insight"" from members on the ""scope of the problem from their view,"" Kirby said.

The issue of extremism in the military has been at the forefront since the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. At least 22 people either formerly or currently associated with the military were charged in connection with the riot, according to CNN's latest analysis

While Austin gave a 60-day timeframe for the stand down, Kirby said he expects the secretary will take ""additional action"" sooner than that to tackle the issue of extremism. Kirby said these discussions are meant to help inform Austin's ""decision-making going forward.""

""I suspect that that will certainly inform his future decision-making and the policies that he might want the services to start to implement and to enact,"" Kirby said during an off-camera briefing.

Austin met with all of the service secretaries and service chiefs, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, earlier on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

The Department of Defense has not provided extensive data on how many service members over the past few years have exhibited extremist behavior, instead pointing to data provided by the FBI in 2020, where, out of 143 notifications of investigations of military members referred to the Department, 68 of those were related to domestic extremism. They have not provided data on cases or incidents related to extremism in the military beyond that.

US Capitol attack a 'wake-up call' for Defense Department

Kirby acknowledged the Department of Defense does not have a full handle on the scope of the problem within the military, referring to the riots as a ""wake-up call"" for the department.

""The events on January 6, which were extreme in and of themselves, in which there were members, sadly, of the active duty force, participating and espousing these radical beliefs, and I think that, I know that the events of January 6 served as a wake-up call for this department,"" Kirby said. ""It certainly served as such for the secretary.""

While the Pentagon ordered a review of domestic extremism within the ranks prior to the Capitol attack , Austin has already made clear to senior military leaders that more must be done.

In December, the Pentagon's personnel and readiness director was ordered to conduct a review of domestic extremism in the military. That ongoing review that is due at the end of March will come up with milestones ""to be completed by mid-summer,"" Kirby said last week.

""The secretary is not going to stop that work, he wants them to keep doing that, but in the meantime, he's also as I said, he's also meeting with Chairman Milley and he's going to be talking with military leaders going forward about what they think the scope of the problem is,"" he said at the time.

At the same time, domestic extremism in the military falls within the scope of what House Democrats are examining as part of their investigations into the Capitol attack, a congressional aide and senior House official involved with the effort told CNN.

As part of those investigations, relevant House committees are looking into whether any current US government employees or security clearance holders were involved in the insurrection, both sources said.

But the senior House official involved with congressional investigations into the January 6 attack agreed the US government must first determine just how bad the problem is before steps can be taken to address it.

""There's a lot to be learned about domestic extremism in the military, and the US Government has not put the kind of analytical rigor and bodies on this target that it has on other issues, like Islamic extremism after 9/11,"" the official told CNN.

A priority for Austin

Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who served under former President Barack Obama from 2011-2013, saw parallels in how Austin is responding to domestic terrorist threats after the riot to how the country responded to foreign terrorist threats after 9/11.

""I think that similar to what happened on 9/11 and the threat from foreign terrorists became real as a result of that attack, the threat from domestic terrorism has certainly become very real as a result of what happened on January 6, and clearly how the military works with law enforcement to be able to deal with domestic terrorism is going to be a priority for the secretary,"" Panetta told CNN.

And there may be momentum for change as the involvement of military members and veterans in the events surrounding January 6 offers an opportunity for the Department of Defense to push the message of change throughout the ranks, extremism experts say.

""The issue of extremists -- both white supremacists and anti-government extremists like the militia movement -- in the military is certainly a real problem and a perennial one. For that reason, it needs to be addressed, because the past few decades have illustrated that it will not go away on its own,"" Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow with the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, told CNN.

""We should be realistic about the extent of the problem, of course. We are talking about a small number of extremists here -- but as they can in general society, extremists in the military can cause harm disproportionate to their numbers,"" he said."
Homeland Security secretary: Threat of domestic terrorism is 'persistent',"(CNN) Domestic terrorism is ""one of the greatest threats"" to the United States, newly minted Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN on Wednesday, underscoring that the threat persists.

""To see the insurrection, the horrific acts of January 6, were not only personally devastating, but created in me a commitment to redouble our efforts, to fight hate and to fight one of the greatest threats that we face currently on our homeland, which is the threat of domestic terrorism,"" Mayorkas said in an interview with CNN's Ana Cabrera that aired on ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.""

Mayorkas, who was sworn in Tuesday, is the first Senate-confirmed Homeland Security secretary in nearly two years and will oversee the department's sprawling mission, which includes cybersecurity, immigration and Covid-19 response, among many others. He's the first Latino and immigrant to helm the department.

Mayorkas underscored that the threat of domestic terrorism ""is persistent"" and said the department will continue to work with its state and local partners to combat it. The secretary conceded that one of the challenges is identifying ""where the line between hateful rhetoric and hateful action takes place.""

The concern was reiterated by the department's acting deputy secretary, David Pekoske, who said Wednesday that domestic violent extremism is a ""particular area of concern"" heading into Super Bowl weekend, speaking at a news conference with the NFL and other law enforcement officials.

Domestic violent extremism remains a concern for Super Bowl security,"(CNN) Domestic terrorism remains a concern for law enforcement heading into Super Bowl weekend, Department of Homeland Security Acting Deputy Secretary David Pekoske said as officials aimed to assure the public that the game and surrounding venues would be safe.

""At this time, one particular area of concern is domestic violent extremism,"" Pekoske said, pointing to the recently released DHS terror threat bulletin during a news conference Wednesday with the NFL and law enforcement officials.

There were ""no specific adjustments"" to operations due to the insurrection at the US Capitol but there is a greater emphasis on investigative and intelligence work with respect to those threats, Pekoske said.

""We see no specific credible threat for this event, but we want to be prepared,"" he said.

White House still waiting for GOP response to follow-up from Oval Office Covid-19 relief meeting,"(CNN) The White House, in the wake of President Joe Biden's lengthy two-hour meeting with 10 Senate Republicans Monday night, sent two detailed memos to the group the next morning addressing specific concerns raised about school funding and direct payments.

Republicans have yet to respond, according to an administration official.

The memos, obtained by CNN, provide insight into the specific policy concerns raised by Republicans in the February 1 meeting -- and were an effort, administration officials said, to provide a detailed defense of the proposal.

Biden, in the meeting, promised senators they would receive those details, and by 11 a.m. the next morning they were sent to Capitol Hill.

A major point of contention between Republicans and the White House has been what senators have viewed as a lack of justification for the scale of Biden's plan. The memos, sent at Biden's request, served as an effort to address that issue.

Why Donald Trump could melt away (Opinion),"Larry Tye is the author of "" Demagogue: The Life and Long Shadow of Senator Joe McCarthy "" and runs the Boston-based Health Coverage Fellowship, which trains medical journalists. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Donald Trump followed Sen. Joseph McCarthy's how-to-be-a-demagogue playbook to the letter throughout his shocking rise to power and stormy four-year presidency.

Now, with the Senate set to launch his second impeachment trial, Trump should take one more lesson from McCarthy. The Red-baiting lawmaker vowed to fight on after the political establishment shunned him in 1954 -- and his millions of boosters were ready to rally yet again -- but instead the seemingly shameless Republican from Wisconsin quietly decamped in a way that helped the nation heal.

Trump's debt to ""Low Blow"" Joe was apparent from the first. In lieu of solutions, the former president, like the senator, pointed fingers. Attacked, both bullies aimed wrecking balls at their assailants. When one charge against a manufactured enemy was exposed as specious, they lobbed fresh bombshells.

Each made his name into a ubiquitous brand. Neither had a master plan other than accruing and hanging onto power. Both astounded the world and themselves by rising as far and fast as they did.

Candidate Trump bragged to supporters in 2016 that ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters."" Sixty-two years earlier, polling pioneer George Gallup offered an eerily similar forecast about McCarthy's minions: ""Even if it were known that McCarthy had killed five innocent children, they would probably still go along with him.""

The connection between the two is more than hypothetical. The flesh-and-blood link was Roy Marcus Cohn, an ingenious and imperious attorney from New York. In the 1970s, an aging Cohn taught the fledgling Trump the lessons he had learned a quarter century before from his then-boss McCarthy -- how to slander opponents and contrive grand conspiracies. Trump has celebrated his connections with Cohn although never, ever with McCarthy.

McCarthy gripped the public's imagination for precisely as long as Trump -- a full four years. At the start of 1954, the anti-communist senator's favorability ratings were higher than the anti-immigrant president's ever were, with a full 50% of Americans saying he was doing a good job and his name implanted in public discussion as an ""ism"" that became synonymous with reckless accusation and guilt-by-association.

But then McCarthy put in his crosshairs an enemy too big to bully, the mighty US Army, the most stouthearted and sacrosanct institution in America, and which had just waged a lethal war on the Korean Peninsula against Communists.

By the end of the Senate's famous Army-McCarthy hearings, the senator's popularity had sunk to 34% , which is almost exactly where today's polls put Trump.

That December, the Senate finally summoned the backbone to condemn its rogue colleague. McCarthy was unbowed, branding the congressional tribunal a ""circus,"" pledging to ""get back to the real work of digging out communism"" and even talking about running for president.

But he didn't. It was partly that he wasn't well. He'd been in and out of Bethesda Naval Hospital for a bad back, aching elbow, wrenched knee, herniated diaphragm, painful gallstone, bleeding gums, obstructed sinuses, throbbing headaches and hemorrhoids, sore feet and a scarred liver.

His medical records reveal one more malady that mounted alongside his political woes and likely exacerbated his physical ones: substance abuse. He was a drinking man in a drinking town. By the middle of 1956, a year before he died, McCarthy confided to doctors that his ""alcoholic intake is 3 highballs daily."" A neurologist wrote, ""Patient has been recovering from acute hallucinosis and delirium.""

There was more, however, to this last closing chapter of the senator's saga. He realized it wasn't just a censure vote that he'd lost. His assaults on Dwight D. Eisenhower's White House ensured he'd be shunned not just there but at the Army, the State Department, the FBI and even the Post Office.

Newspapers banished him to page 25, next to the corset ads, or wrote him out entirely. So did his Senate colleagues. Being subjected to a punishment so extreme that it had been meted out just five times in that chamber's 165 years, meant trading in the badge of the outlier, which McCarthy had proudly worn from his first days in office, for the stigmata of the shunned that made him the butt of even the president's jokes.

So while he remained a US senator, he did so softly enough that few noticed him anymore. And while he publicly insisted he'd run for reelection back in Wisconsin, he confided to a companion, ""Jean and I have enough money for a small cattle spread in Arizona. I might open a little law office for friends and neighbors with my books and degree right on the place.""

Is there a chance that Trump might likewise just melt away? It seems inconceivable, but it did for McCarthy, too, who also coveted the spotlight and continued to inspire tens of millions of true believers.

What is clear is that the rogue ex-president has already taken matters several steps further than the outlaw senator ever did. McCarthy fought hard and dirty to win offices for himself and his allies, yet when either lost, he accepted the results. And while he delighted in riling up his unflinching disciples, he stopped short of inciting insurrection.

If the former president continues according to form, there is one outcome that seems certain: He'll displace McCarthy as America's archetypal demagogue, and McCarthyism will be replaced in the American lexicon by an ever more unnerving doctrine -- Trumpism."
"Opinion: FDR got this right. Biden can, too","(CNN) Since assuming office on January 20, President Joe Biden has taken vigorous action, signing over 40 executive orders that address problems ranging from health care to the economy. Predictably, the reaction has been mixed , with the editorial board of The New York Times opining that the new president should ""Ease Up on the Executive Actions, Joe.""

However, Biden's flurry of executive orders forms part of a deliberate strategy to project a new vision for the country, and it makes sense for him to use the power he has in this way. In fact, Biden and his team are modeling their first 100 days in office after the example of one former president in particular: Franklin D. Roosevelt

Like the Great Depression facing the nation in 1933, when Roosevelt took office, the multiple crises -- health, economic and racial -- afflicting the United States in 2021 require decisive action on both the executive and legislative fronts. To follow successfully in the footsteps of Roosevelt, however, Biden needs to thread the needle between targeted executive action and congressional legislation.

The crisis of the Great Depression compelled Roosevelt to take bold action during his first 100 days in office. In his first inaugural address, he declared: ""This nation asks for action, and action now."" He hoped to work in coordination with Congress, but if that legislative body failed to act, he would ask for ""broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.""

Biden and his team have hewn closely to this Roosevelt strategy in their first two weeks. In his inaugural address, Biden declared that the many crises facing the United States required ""a time for boldness."" The administration's call for a ""big, bold package"" to address Covid-19 relief, viewing the risk as ""not going too big, it is going too small."" Following the President's lead, Democrats in Congress are prepared to proceed without Republican support if necessary.

JUST WATCHED This Biden clip is being used against him. Here are the facts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This Biden clip is being used against him. Here are the facts 02:58

During Roosevelt's first 100 days, the Democratically-controlled US House of Representatives and US Senate passed numerous aspects of the proposed New Deal legislation, designed to lessen the economic impact of the Depression on millions of Americans. Among the first of these was the Emergency Banking Act , passed on March 9, just five days after Roosevelt's inauguration, which submitted banks to federal inspection and removed the US from the gold standard. Other legislative efforts , such as National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which aimed to stabilize prices, increase wages and ensure collective bargaining, were hallmarks of this first congressional session.

But Roosevelt also utilized executive orders to augment key components of his New Deal program. Citing the Emergency Banking Act, he ordered private supplies of gold to be given over to increase the government's reserves. Building upon the NIRA, he created the Civil Works Administration -- a jobs program that aimed to add about 4 million government jobs -- and following subsequent emergency relief, he established the Works Progress Administration in 1935 that similarly set forth to create public works jobs. Roosevelt also launched the Rural Electrification Administration that helped bring electricity to rural areas across the country.

In the same way, many of Biden's executive orders address economic concerns that require immediate action. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, he has called for assistance to those who are struggling to buy food, pay rent and make student loan payments. Similarly, his plan to raise the minimum wage for federal workers to $15 and restore collective bargaining power right echoes Roosevelt's own commitments.

Roosevelt's executive orders during wartime likewise aimed to meet the emergency of effective resource allocation. By executive order, Roosevelt established the War Production Board in 1942 for ""assuring the most effective prosecution of war procurement and production."" The board stayed in effect until the end of the war in 1945, when it was replaced by the Civilian Production Administration.

The complexities of Covid-19 testing and vaccine distribution demand a similar response from the federal government today. Biden has established a Covid-19 pandemic testing board to widen the capacity of coronavirus testing. He has further directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to expand federal dollars for expenses pertaining to the National Guard's role in scaling up vaccination.

Nevertheless, executive action can prove terribly misguided. Roosevelt's infamous Executive Order 9066 created military areas for the internment of certain designated Americans, which in practice predominantly targeted Japanese Americans. Despite legal challenges to the order, the US Supreme Court upheld the legality of the camps twice.

Later presidents took executive action to provide restitution to internment victims, until in 1988, Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act to provide reparations totaling $1.6 billion. Fittingly, Biden's recent executive order to address racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US furthers equity among many of these same groups.

Overall, then, executive action worked best for Roosevelt when in tandem with the efforts of Congress. Following Roosevelt's lead, Biden has appropriately begun to utilize the many tools at his disposal, executive orders among them, to combat a pandemic that has already taken more lives than all the American combat casualties in World War II. At the same time, Biden has signaled his intention to work closely with congressional leaders from both parties, even as he has already begun to wind down his use of executive orders to focus on the pending Covid relief bill. But thus far his executive orders have been unaided by congressional legislation.

The critical question remaining is this: will Congress -- as it has done before during times of crisis -- fulfill its responsibility to legislate?"
"Miguel Cardona: Education secretary nominee pushes for teacher testing, vaccination in Senate hearing","Washington (CNN) Secretary of Education nominee Miguel Cardona told senators Wednesday that if confirmed, he will do everything in his power to reopen schools safely and called for prioritizing educators for the vaccine and increasing Covid testing at schools.

""There is no substitute for a classroom experience for our students, being in front of their teacher,"" Cardona, Connecticut's education commissioner, said at his confirmation hearing.

""So we have to do everything we can to safely reopen schools in a manner that gets the students back into their learning environment,"" he added.

Cardona, whose family is from Puerto Rico, enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top of Connecticut's public education system. He began his career as fourth-grade teacher in Meriden, in the same district where he attended school. Cardona soon became a principal and then assistant superintendent of the district before being named state commissioner in 2019.

The Senate committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is expected to forward his nomination to the full Senate for confirmation in the coming days.

A long-forgotten attic hid a photography studio and a famous portrait of Susan B. Anthony,"Want more inspiring, positive news? Sign up for The Good Stuff , a newsletter for the good in life. It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.

(CNN) David J. Whitcomb had no idea that the Geneva, New York, building he bought in December 2020 for his law office even had an attic, so he was doubly surprised to find the treasures that have been stashed there for nearly 100 years.

Whitcomb and a friend noticed that the ceiling on the third floor looked odd after going up to change a light bulb.

They saw an access panel and stacked up some chairs so that Whitcomb could climb up and see what was inside, illuminated only by the tiny flashlight on his phone.

""The first thing I saw was a whole bunch of picture frames stacked together and these frames are gorgeous. They're the turn-of-the-century, they're gold, gilded, and they shone really bright and I was like 'Oh my God,'"" he said. ""I lowered myself and said 'I think we just found the 'Goonies' treasure.'""

They returned the following day and spent about 12 hours going through stacks of pictures, frames, glass negatives, and photography equipment from the late 1800s and early 1900s.

One of the things they found was a framed portrait of suffragist leader Susan B. Anthony that was taken by photographer James Hale in 1905 -- a year before her death.

Anthony campaigned tirelessly for women's rights, including the right to vote, and was arrested in 1872 for voting in an election.

The photo of Susan B. Anthony was taken in 1905.

Hale gave the copyright to the photo to The Susan B. Anthony Memorial Association, which selected the picture as her official photograph and sold prints and postcards to raise funds. A clipping featuring the photo is in the collection at the Library of Congress

Whitcomb said they found mail and other documents with Hale's name on it and pieces of the original glass plate negative used to print the photo, broken at some point over the years.

They haven't yet found the section of the negative with her head, but one piece shows the flag pin she wore on her left side in the portrait. Whitcomb is still hoping to find the rest of the negative, but he fears that it might be lost for good.

Most of the people in the photos are not identified, but they believe they've found portraits of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Elizabeth Smith Miller , who were also leaders in the women's rights movement.

They also found pictures of local sports teams, men in military uniforms, and a large burlap sack that was filled with hundreds of prints that appeared to have been thrown away.

Whitcomb found a photographer in Geneva who is going to try to develop prints from many of the glass negatives that they found.

Whitcomb holds a fragment from a glass photographic negative.

He reached out to the Geneva Historical Society and was referred to the society's former President Dan Weinstock, who has researched Hale and the local photography scene of the era.

Weinstock, a retired doctor, told CNN that Hale had won prizes and recognition for his photography and was known for taking a picture of President Grover Cleveland's fiancé Francis Folsom in 1885.

He said Hale moved to Geneva in 1892 and worked there until 1920, when he sold his photography business to another photographer.

Hale was connected to the women's rights movement, and a collection of his photos of suffragist leaders was showcased at the 1907 New York State Woman Suffrage Association, which was held in Geneva.

Weinstock said he knew that Hale had a studio in the building's second floor, but he'd never heard about the attic.

The man Whitcomb bought the building from didn't know about it either, and previous owners, who had bought it in the 1960s, were dumbfounded by the discovery.

At some point, the third floor was turned into an apartment and a drop ceiling was installed to hide the space. The apartment hasn't been rented for decades and has been used by the attorneys working in the offices on the first two floors to store documents.

""We don't know how it ended up where it did and why it was just left and sealed off,"" Whitcomb said. ""We'll probably never know the answer to that, but a little mystery is a good thing, I guess.""

He bought the building to expand his law office and says he'll leave the attic exposed when he eventually renovates the apartment.

Whitcomb is working with a local auction company to empty the attic and start the huge job of cataloging everything.

""He was all excited, like a kid in a candy store, he couldn't believe it, he was like a little mini treasure hunter, One Source Auctions owner Aaron Kirvan said, describing the day Whitcomb came into his shop.

Kirvan said he treated the attic like a crime scene because many of the items just looked like junk to the untrained eye.

The photos are covered in soot from a fire in a neighboring building.

In addition to the photos, there were backdrops, props and even the furniture that was used in some of the portraits.

""It's like stepping back in time finding this guy's studio from a hundred years ago or more,"" Kirvan said.

Kirvan said he's got no idea what the collection is worth because it's so unique, but he thinks there will be a lot of interest. He said they're hoping to hold an auction in May or June if they can get everything cleaned up and if Covid-19 is contained enough for them to draw a good crowd.

Anthony lived in nearby Rochester for much of her life and there will be a celebration of what would have been her 201st birthday on February 15.

Deborah L. Hughes, the president and CEO of The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House , told CNN that she has a print of the Hale photo hanging in her office.

She said they get dozens of calls each year from people who've gotten letters from Anthony and that they're still learning new things about the suffragist movement from those correspondences, diaries and other documents kept by women of the day.

Hughes was excited when Whitcomb called about his find and said it was an amazing story.

""When I think about this negative and the broken glass, it's a little bit reminiscent of some of the glass ceilings that Susan B. Anthony set in place for us to keep breaking,"" she said."
"Ohio grand jury indicts Columbus officer who fatally shot Andre Hill, state attorney general says","(CNN) Adam Coy, the former Columbus, Ohio, police officer who shot and killed Andre Hill, was indicted by a grand jury Wednesday on several charges and later arrested, according to an announcement from Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.

Coy was arrested at his attorney's office Wednesday afternoon. He is charged with murder in the commission of a felony, felonious assault, and two counts of dereliction of duty -- one based on Coy's failure to use his body camera and one ""based on his failure to inform his fellow officer that he felt Andre Hill presented a danger,"" Yost said.

""The community was outraged by the killing of Andre Hill, an unarmed Black man, by law enforcement,"" Mayor Andrew Ginther tweeted Wednesday. ""The indictment does not lessen the pain of his tragic death for Mr. Hill's loved ones, but it is a step towards justice. I thank the grand jury for their service.""

Mark C. Collins and Kaitlyn C. Stephens, attorneys for Coy, said in a statement they were not surprised by the indictment.

""The grand jury only hears what the prosecuting attorney wants them to hear. There is no judge. There are no rules,"" the statement read. ""The grand jury's function is singular -- to determine if there is probable cause to indict. This is a much different and more importantly, much lower standard than what the State of Ohio will have to prove come trial."""
Biden is expected to announce increase in amount of refugees admitted into US,"(CNN) The Biden administration plans to announce on Thursday that it will increase the number of refugees who can come to the United States, a move toward building up refugee admissions after years of historic low arrivals under former President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with the plans.

President Joe Biden, who pledged to raise the cap during the campaign, is expected to announce his intention to increase the number of refugees allowed into the US during a visit to the State Department, according to one source. The Trump administration set a refugee cap of 15,000 for this fiscal year, the lowest since 1980. It's unclear by how much the Biden administration will increase that cap.

The refugee cap must be approved by the president. Biden has pledged to set an annual admissions cap of 125,000, though the plan is to wait until October, when the next fiscal year begins, to set that cap, according to one of the sources.

The refugee cap increase builds on a series of executive actions from Biden aimed at setting a new course for US immigration policy following the Trump administration's hardline approach.

On Tuesday, the President signed three executive orders that largely direct reviews of Trump-era policies, including the establishment of a task force designed to reunite families separated at the US-Mexico border.

Federal judge moves Oregon prisoners ahead of seniors on vaccination list,"(CNN) A federal judge ruled that Oregon must offer Covid-19 vaccinations to all prison inmates immediately -- putting them ahead of the state's senior citizens in line for the limited supply of vaccines.

In an order issued Tuesday, US Magistrate Judge Stacie F. Beckerman wrote that inmates are particularly vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus because they live and work in close quarters and have limited ability to social distance.

""From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was clear that our country's prisons were uniquely vulnerable to the transmission and spread of the virus,"" she wrote. ""Prisons have not been spared from this reality, as COVID-19's toll continues to mount behind bars.""

A spokesman for Oregon's governor said the state would speed up the vaccination of adults in custody to comply with the order, and that the state does not expect the judge's order to alter the timeline for vaccinating seniors, who were already scheduled to start receiving shots next week.

There have been more than 368,000 cases among prison inmates, according to the Covid Prison Project , which tracks Covid-19 in US correctional facilities, and more than 2,250 deaths. It said almost 3,400 Oregon inmates have tested positive and more than 40 have died of Covid-19

New charges allege Proud Boys prepped for Capitol insurrection,"(CNN) Two prominent affiliates of the Proud Boys face new conspiracy charges related to the US Capitol riot, and another was arrested Wednesday, as the Justice Department laid out a planning and funding effort within the far-right extremist group in a major court development.

The Justice Department unveiled the new conspiracy charge in a federal grand jury indictment of Nicholas Ochs and Nicholas DeCarlo.

The indictment alleges the two conspired to block Congress' certification of the electoral votes on January 6. Prosecutors say they planned and fundraised for the effort, then came to Washington, DC, and stormed past police and into the Capitol building as part of the violent crowd, according to a copy of the indictment.

Wednesday's indictment came shortly after the Justice Department made clear it had taken more investigative steps against Proud Boys affiliates related to the insurrection. The Proud Boys are a far-right group known for their clashes with Antifa and general support of former President Donald Trump, who even mentioned them in a presidential debate , telling them to ""stand back and stand by.""

Also on Wednesday, the so-called Sergeant at arms of the Proud Boys in Seattle, Ethan Nordean, aka ""Rufio Panman,"" was arrested, then appeared in federal court for his role in the riot. Federal prosecutors wrote they believed Nordean asked on social media for help to buy ""protective gear"" and ""communications equipment,"" with the intention of organizing people before the January 6 siege, his charging document said. He is charged with three counts related to entering the Capitol, and the allegations he faces name several other Proud Boys affiliates among the crowd.

At least 11 people with ties to the Proud Boys have been charged in connection with the Capitol insurrection, according to a CNN analysis of court documents and Justice Department statements.

A flight, flex-cuffs and etching the Memorial Door

Prosecutors outlined that Ochs and DeCarlo, as part of the conspiracy, allegedly raised money online so they could fly from their home states of Texas and Hawaii to DC for the January 6 pro-Trump event. They also ""publicized"" their plans, the indictment said.

The pair is alleged to have inscribed the words ""murder the media"" on a notable entrance to the Capitol, the Memorial Door. In previous court records, investigators showed a photo of Ochs and DeCarlo standing beside the etching with their thumbs up. The damage to the door was less than $1,000, the indictment said.

In all, the indictment on Wednesday charges them with seven counts, including conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding and theft and destruction of government property.

One charge now accuses them of stealing from Capitol Police a pair of flex handcuffs -- the same types of zip-tie-like restraints that the Justice Department has focused on in other cases as rioters potentially intended to take lawmakers hostage.

Investigators began building the case in court against Ochs and DeCarlo in the days after the Capitol riot. To arrest them each, the FBI had described how both were believed to be inside the Capitol building and could be identified in photos and videos taken during the insurrection.

Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, were killed in the riot. Members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence were evacuated to safety, temporarily shutting down debate over the Electoral College results.

During the riot, Ochs -- the founder of the Hawaii chapter of the Proud Boys -- tweeted a selfie of himself smoking a cigarette in the building.

""We didn't have to break in, I just walked in and filmed,"" Ochs told CNN in an interview. ""There were thousands of people in there -- they had no control of the situation. I didn't get stopped or questioned.""

Ochs ran an unsuccessful campaign for the state legislature last year, winning an endorsement from Trump confidant Roger Stone, who recorded a video with him. He claimed in the interview with CNN that he was working as a professional journalist when he entered the Capitol, and that he didn't go into any congressional offices or the chambers.

DeCarlo also claimed he was a journalist, in an interview he gave to the Los Angeles Times after January 6, according to court records. But he is not credentialed as a journalist by Congress, investigators said, and he operates a YouTube channel with Ochs and ""purports to be an employee"" of a group called ""MT Media News,"" standing for ""murder the media news,"" an affidavit supporting his arrest said.

Arrest in Seattle

Nordean, a 30-year-old Washington state resident, is charged in the DC District Court with four counts in total, all related to his actions on January 6.

Investigators say he was marching at the front of the crowd near the Capitol, next to another prominent Proud Boys affiliate, Joseph Biggs , who has also been charged in recent weeks. Investigators also say Nordean interacted with another person previously charged, Robert Gieswein, during their push into the Capitol. Gieswein went into a window in the Capitol that was first broken by another Proud Boys affiliate, Dominic Pezzola, who has also been charged related to the riot.

""Assembled close behind Nordean in the crowd in front of the Capitol were a group of individuals that I have identified as many of the same people who had been seen marching behind Nordean, Biggs, and other Proud Boys earlier in the day,"" investigators wrote, recreating the group effort of parts of the crowd to force their way inside the building.

Investigators said they don't have evidence Nordean was part of his acquaintances' effort to break in through a window. They used extensive photos and videos to place him among the riot outside and inside the Capitol building, court records say.

Investigators also described his social media activity before January 6, including a video on Parler two days earlier in which Nordean said the Proud Boys should protect the community and respond to voter fraud beliefs with ""that original spirit of 1776.""

""We're coming back. We're coming to DC and were going to take this country back. Your gifts, and your thoughts, and your financial contributions will not go for nothing,"" another person said in the January 5 Parler video, investigators wrote to the court in an affidavit supporting Nordean's arrest.

Nordean made his initial appearance in federal court in Washington state Wednesday afternoon through video conference. He will be held in detention until another court hearing on February 8.

Building conspiracy cases, charging others

Federal officials have said repeatedly in recent weeks they are looking into groups -- and to charge possible seditious conspiracies -- that indicate coordination before the Capitol riot. But cases are still moving slowly and in the early stages. No sedition cases have been brought.

Still, several other Proud Boys members are already in federal court and faces criminal charges following the riot.

Two other Proud Boys affiliates, Pezzola and William Pepe , both of New York, are accused of working together during the attack of the Capitol, according to their indictment last week.

A fixture and organizer in Proud Boys mass gatherings, Biggs, of Florida, is facing charges in an initial complaint related to him entering the Capitol grounds.

in addition to members of the Proud Boys, a separate group of alleged right-wing extremists was previously indicted on a conspiracy charge.

In that case, which is also in an early stage, Thomas Caldwell of Virginia and Jessica Watkins and Donovan Crowl of Ohio are alleged to have coordinated before the January 6 attack, and to have discussed or attended paramilitary training camps

Prosecutors say the three are affiliated with right-wing paramilitary organizations in Ohio and with the national paramilitary group the Oath Keepers.

Why Kevin McCarthy has already failed hist first big leadership test,"(CNN) ""When you have to make a choice and don't make it, that is in itself a choice,"" William James, one of the most prominent American philosophers of the 19th Century, once said.

James' words rang through my head over the last 24 hours as it became more and more clear that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, wasn't actually going to make a decision about whether Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's past extremist and intolerant comments should result in the Georgia congresswoman being stripped of her committee assignments.

After a lengthy meeting with Greene on Tuesday night in which she refused to apologize for her past actions, a person with knowledge of the matter told CNN , McCarthy foisted the matter onto the Republican Steering Committee. But the Steering Committee adjourned Tuesday night without rendering a decision on Greene. So McCarthy turned to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, for help. But a meeting between the two men earlier Wednesday produced no resolution to the problem.

""I spoke to Leader McCarthy this morning, and it is clear there is no alternative to holding a floor vote on the resolution to remove Rep. Greene from her committee assignments,"" Hoyer said in a statement following the meeting. ""The Rules Committee will meet this afternoon, and the House will vote on the resolution tomorrow.""

Which means that, almost certainly, the fate of Greene's committee service will be left to the Democratic House majority -- taking McCarthy entirely (or mostly) out of the picture.

Justice Department rescinds two Trump-era voting directives,"(CNN) The Justice Department on Tuesday rescinded two voting-related memos issued by the Trump administration, including one that prompted a public corruption prosecutor to step down from his post because it upended decades of department policy on voter fraud investigations to not interfere in states' vote certification.

Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson announced that the Justice Department will pull back the November memo from former Attorney General William Barr on vote fraud investigations and a second memo that gave Justice Department blessing to efforts by some states to pull back expansions of voting access, such as early or absentee voting, as a result of the Covid crisis.

Republicans in some states are trying to change laws after President Donald Trump falsely complained that they led to fraud.

Barr's November 9 memo to the Justice Department's District Election Officers, repealed a decades-old policy on how prosecutors in the unit investigated ballot fraud. Richard Pilger, who was the director of the District Election Officers, resigned and returned to his role in the public integrity section of the Justice Department.

At the time, Barr told prosecutors that they can bypass procedural steps during the investigation like interviewing witnesses during a period when they usually need permission from the District Election Officers to do so. Barr publicly pushed former Trump's narrative of voter fraud until the former attorney general submitted his letter of resignation in December.

Coronavirus vaccines in South America: Inside the region's race to vaccinate against Covid-19,"Bogota (CNN) The race for coronavirus vaccines is on across the world and South American policymakers are scrambling to catch up.

The region accounts for roughly 15% of the world's reported Covid-19 cases, but less than 3% of the global vaccine doses administered so far, according to data collected by Oxford University.

Amid a devastating second wave, governments are looking for help abroad -- creating openings for "" vaccine diplomacy "" in a global competition for influence, experts say.

""Latin American countries will vie for vaccines and medical supplies regardless of where they come from,"" said Parsifal D'Sola, the founder and CEO of the Andres Bello Foundation, a think tank devoted to Chinese-Latin American relationships. ""So far, developed nations have bought over 50% of the available vaccines, so Latin America will likely reach out to China and Russia to fill the void.""

""Odds are that China, having a massive production capability, will take advantage of the opportunity to distribute vaccines to the Global South and promote itself as a leading power that looks after the interests and well-being of the developing world,"" he added.

The Coronavac, made by Chinese company Sinovac, is already part of large-scale distribution in Brazil. Russia's Sputnik V vaccines has been embraced by several countries including Argentina and Bolivia. But broadly, regional delivery of vaccines is messy and unequal with no coordinated approach, and it remains to be seen how the pandemic could shape future diplomatic relationship between South America and the rest of the world.

As Cynthia Arnson , Director of the Latin American Program at the Wilson Center policy forum in Washington, told CNN, South American countries ""have rarely been so disunited and unable to forge common strategies.""

Here's where their vaccination campaigns stand for now:

Argentina

The left-wing government of Alberto Fernandez was among the first in the world to secure orders of the Russian-developed Sputnik V vaccine.

In December, flag-carrier Aerolineas Argentinas live-tweeted a special flight to Moscow to pick up the first doses, a sign of how close the partnership with Russia is seen in Buenos Aires.

Argentina has also secured orders from other manufacturers for a total of almost 50 million doses, according to Duke University's database of vaccine pre-purchase agreements.

All the vaccines dispensed so far have been from Russia.

Brazil

Brazil has been among the most-hit in the world by the coronavirus, and its vaccine saga has turned ugly with state governors criticizing the federal government for lack of coordination, and President Jair Bolsonaro casting doubt on vaccines.

Compared to its neighbors, Brazil has strong vaccine manufacturing capabilities. However, experts say the country fell behind in the race to purchase active ingredients to produce them.

Now, the country's best hope is the Chinese Coronavac vaccine , an ironic outcome given Bolsonaro's signs of hostility toward China. More than 2 million doses have already been dispensed in Brasil, by far the highest number in the region.

Bolivia

Bolivia experienced a change in power in November when left-wing President Luis Arce replaced Jeanine Añez.

While he awaits the first COVAX doses allotted to Bolivia, Arce has been able to secure at least 20,000 Russian vaccine doses, which arrived in Bolivia on January 28.

The purchase signals closer relationships with both Russia and Argentina, where President Fernandez is a close ally of Arce's and his predecessor Evo Morales.

Chile

Public data from Duke University show that Chile pre-purchased vaccines from Western manufacturers AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, but the greatest order was placed for China's Coronavac. China is already Chile's top economic partner.

Despite ordering over 90 million vaccine doses for a population of less than 20 million people, Chile's vaccination program has yet to pick up steam. Fewer than 70,000 people have been vaccinated so far.

Colombia

Colombia is the largest South American country that still has not commenced vaccinations.

President Ivan Duque responded to critics saying the country relied mostly on the COVAX mechanism and promising that vaccinations will begin on February 20.

Colombia, the United States' closest ally in the region, did not purchase vaccines directly from either Russia but recently announced a small purchase of the Chinese-made Coronavac.

Ecuador

Last month, this Andean country began its vaccination program using the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Like other nations in the region, it is eagerly awaiting for the COVAX mechanism to start delivering doses.

Ecuador is holding presidential elections on Sunday. Front runner left wing candidate Andres Arauz has harshly criticized the government's management of the crisis, and claims that if elected, he will secure millions more doses from China and Russia by the way of Argentina.

Guyana and Suriname

Neither has begun vaccinating -- but the impact of the pandemic has been minor, with less than 10 thousand cases in each of them.

Both are due to receive doses through COVAX.

Paraguay

The only landlocked country in South America is a case study for vaccine diplomacy.

Paraguay doesn't have diplomatic relations with Beijing, and has recognized Taiwan -- which is claimed by China -- as the legitimate Republic of China.

Last year, a group of lawmakers presented a motion to the Senate to switch recognition in Beijing's favor, in hopes of receiving more medical supplies to curb the pandemic. The vote did not pass.

Paraguay has yet to receive a single dose of the vaccine, but it awaits more than 4 million doses through COVAX.

Peru

Like neighbouring Colombia, Peru hasn't received any doses yet. Both countries expect to be among the first that will receive vaccines from COVAX, but Peru has also tapped into China's Sinopharm vaccine to boost its arsenal.

In total, Peru is expecting over 50 million doses, in part thanks to the vaccine trials it held last year to provide precious data to manufacturers.

Uruguay

After Venezuela, Uruguay has the lowest number of reported Covid-19 deaths per million people in South America. The government has orders in with both Pfizer and Sinovac, while also expecting almost 2 million doses through COVAX.

One of the smallest countries in the region, Uruguay has already commenced vaccinations.

President Lacalle Pou has deplored what he called ""an impressive commercial war"" around the vaccines.

Venezuela

On paper, Venezuela is the South American country least affected by the pandemic.

However, strong doubts remain over the capacity of embattled President Nicolas Maduro's government to effectively track cases in the country

Maduro announced Venezuela would receive vaccines from its traditional allies Russia and China as early as October, but no vaccination campaign has been set up yet.

Maduro has also been hoping to receive the Cuban vaccine Soberana 01, which is still under development.

In January, Venezuela was blocked from joining COVAX due to lack of payments, according to the Pan American Health Organization.

Florida town completes legal review of Trump's residency at Mar-a-Lago,"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) The legal review by the town of Palm Beach into the use of Mar-a-Lago as former President Donald Trump's permanent home concluded that the original agreement among the town, the resort and Trump does not expressly prohibit him from residing there.

In a memo produced by the town's attorney and posted on the town's website, lawyer John ""Skip"" Randolph advised the town to look instead to its zoning ordinance, which permits only bona fide employees to reside in private clubs. Thus, if Trump is a ""bona fide employee of the club,"" town zoning would allow him to live on the premises, Randolph concluded.

Randolph recommended in the memo that the town council hear from interested parties, including Trump, and debate the issue further.

A letter to Randolph from Trump's attorney last month argued that the former President is a bona fide employee of the resort and therefore is ""clearly entitled to reside there.""

The town of Palm Beach will hear the review as part of its Town Council Meeting scheduled for next Tuesday, according to the agenda and supporting documents posted on the town's website.

"Federal prosecutors top 180 Capitol riot cases, with man seen in 'American Supremacist' sweatshirt among the latest","(CNN) The Justice Department has exceeded 180 federal criminal cases against rioters and others connected to the US Capitol siege , with prosecutors' latest charges coming against a man seen in videos wearing an ""American Supremacist"" sweatshirt in the Capitol on January 6.

CNN has found that 181 people have been charged in federal court as of Wednesday morning, according to Justice Department announcements and court records.

The latest charges, against Dennis Sidorski of northern Virginia, accuse him of four counts related to violent entry into the restricted grounds of the Capitol. He was seen on video, according to a sworn affidavit from investigators, walking through the halls of the Capitol during the riot. CNN has reached out to Sidorski's attorney for comment on the charges.

Sidorski's charge -- though notable for his ""Supremacist"" shirt message -- is emblematic of many of the arrests on low-level charges the Justice Department has made in its nationwide effort to round up rioters who stormed the Capitol after coming to Washington in support of then-President Donald Trump's challenge to the electoral win of now-President Joe Biden.

Yet dozens of the cases against Capitol riot defendants have revealed more severe crimes, the troubling histories of defendants and even how prosecutors are looking at terrorism tactics used by right-wing extremists

Prosecutors have charged a handful of defendants in conspiracies, including alleging members of one paramilitary group planned for an assault on the Capitol. They've also sought out people who allegedly were violent toward police or made direct threats of violence against lawmakers and others.

Prosecutors point to defendants' histories

In federal courts across the country this week, prosecutors dug into the histories of defendants as some of the cases move toward detention requests -- including arguing to judges how one man with a history of stolen valor and a New Mexico county official should be detained.

The New Mexico county commissioner, Couy Griffin, had said in a county meeting that he wished to return to DC for the Biden inauguration with guns in his car. He had said in a meeting of a political group he leads called Cowboys for Trump that ""The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.""

At a court hearing on Monday, Griffin's attorney said he wasn't ""a crazy person, even though he's made some unfortunate statements."" But the judge responded that ""words matter"" and it wasn't enough for Griffin to make a direct threat and then say he didn't mean it. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui ordered him to stay in jail in DC to await trial.

In eastern Texas, a judge decided on Sunday to keep in jail Troy Anthony Smocks, who is charged with one crime related to the insurrection -- writing a threat on Parler about carrying weapons on January 6 and hunting down ""RINOs"" (or Republicans in Name Only), Democrats and tech executives, according to filings in his criminal case. Smocks' history -- with 18 past convictions including impersonating a federal agent and accusations he posed as a veteran -- contributed to the judge's decision.

Prosecutors say Smocks wore a battle uniform in a YouTube video and, years ago, donned a full military dress uniform ""complete with medals he did not earn"" for a wedding, though he had not served in the military. At other times, he wore a US Drug Enforcement Administration shirt and carried handcuffs to the scene of a search, told a woman that law enforcement was looking for her while he posed as a Secret Service agent, and told police he was in the FBI, according to Justice Department court filings.

More recently, Smocks had developed a following of 30,000 on Parler, came to DC for January 6 and encouraged people to follow the call of the former President, his son Eric Trump and Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama to take up arms as ""American patriots,"" prosecutors said.

Slowing pace of new defendants publicized

Some who were charged weeks ago are just now appearing for the first time in federal court in DC, where their cases will proceed, such as Gabriel Augustin Garcia, who allegedly has a connection to the pro-Trump extremist group the Proud Boys and is charged with three counts related to disorderly conduct inside the Capitol. On Tuesday, a magistrate judge in DC's federal court agreed to allow Garcia to be released, while under GPS monitoring and a curfew.

This week, the number of new defendants made public each day has slowed, after weeks of the Justice Department bringing as many as 10 or more cases in court nearly every day, as investigators identified and arrested some of the hundreds of people in or around the Capitol on January 6."
"'QAnon Shaman' rioter should be given organic food while in jail, judge says","(CNN) US Capitol rioter and so-called ""QAnon Shaman"" Jacob Chansley should be given organic food while in a Washington, DC, jail, a federal judge said Wednesday, after Chansley went on an apparent hunger strike last week claiming non-organic food was against his religion and sickened him.

DC District Court Judge Royce Lamberth decided the accommodations could be made for Chansley because he had been fed organic food in detention in Arizona, and arguments about his adherence to Shamanism were enough to also convince the judge.

Chansley hasn't eaten since last Monday, his attorney said.

""My client made it clear that while he did not oppose fasting, he was not in position to put into his body things that shamanism believes to be impure... things that suck the life out of your body,"" Chansley's lawyer Al Watkins said in court Wednesday afternoon.

Earlier this month, a federal judge decided Chansley, the man seen in photos dressed in horns, fur headdress and face paint inside the US Capitol during the January 6 riot, would remain in jail as he awaits trial, after the Justice Department portrayed him as a particularly belligerent leader among the rioters.

"Ford receives a patent for a new, clear respirator mask that they expect to be just as effective as an N95","(CNN) Ford Motor Company is best known for its cars, but in the Covid-19 pandemic, the manufacturer is branching out.

Ford has received patent-pending approval for a new, clear respirator mask, the company announced Tuesday , one they expect to work just as well as an N95.

A rocky corner in southern Utah has brought 5 tribes together. An executive order is reviving effort to protect them,"(CNN) A rocky corner in southern Utah has been the focal point of protests and political battles for years. A recent move by the Biden administration is giving Native tribes hope that a broken promise could be mended.

On his first day in office, President Joe Biden ordered federal officials to review the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument -- a sprawling region rich in red rock canyons, cliff dwellings and numerous archeological sites that former President Donald Trump drastically shrunk in size (December 4, 2017) only 11 months after its official designation (December 28, 2016).

Bears Ears has united five tribes that trace their lineage to this region in a fight to protect a land they consider sacred and a chance to have a voice in how their ancestral homelands are managed. For Native people, Bears Ears is key to their distinctive origin legends, the spirits of their ancestors and their own ""way of life.""

""Bears Ears represents a place of refuge, a place of commerce, a place of practicing their culture, and most importantly, a place of spiritual and theological practice,"" said Patrick Gonzales-Rogers, executive director of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, a group formed in 2015 by the tribes to advocate for the monument.

In 2017, the monument's boundaries were reduced by roughly 85% after past presidents abused a law that grants them authority to declare national monuments ""to lock up vast swaths of public land,"" former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke wrote in a CNN op-ed at the time.

The future of the monument has remained mostly in limbo since then while Trump's actions are challenged in court and the Bureau of Land Management worked to develop new land use plans for Bears Ears.

The recent executive order signed by Biden reignited that years-long struggle between those who argue that land protection and management by federal agencies is government overreach, and those who seek to preserve the land they consider sacred.

A yearslong effort for stewardship

The mesas, cliffs and canyons in the 1.3 million acres of Bears Ears have been inhabited for tens of thousand of years, archeologists say. Some of its history has been written in sandstone walls and its hills provide healing for tribal members.

While the monument stands outside reservation boundaries, Native people might visit to collect firewood and medicinal herbs as well as to hunt, fish or run in prayer. Meanwhile, those who live far or outside the state often make pilgrimages to the area to connect with their ancestors' spirits.

More than five years before Bears Ears sparked nationwide controversy, Native leaders in San Juan County -- where the monument is located -- began looking into a way to protect the land. They didn't want to be merely observers while others debated the management of public lands. About 47% of the population in San Juan County is Native American, according to US Census estimates.

Utah Diné Bikéyah or ""People's Sacred Lands,"" a Navajo-led group, interviewed numerous elders and proposed multiple government protections for Bears Ears to local and state officials. As the years passed, leaders from different tribes joined efforts and they created conservation plans that would allow the tribes to co-manage the land.

""Those five tribes have their own way of traditionally take care of the land and is particularly different from the Western way of taking care of the land. So we came up with a thought out plan from these different tribes,"" said Woody Lee, executive director of Utah Diné Bikeyah.

In his proclamation, Obama directed officials to engage tribal government officers in the development of a management plan for the monument.

Before a year had passed, the tribes and their supporters went from ""an incredible amount of jubilation and joy,"" Gonzales-Rogers said, to a feeling of ""loss and a form of depression.""

Trump had decided to split the monument into two separate units that comprised approximately 201,876 acres. The boundaries had been cut by roughly 85%.

Ancient history in danger

From the low desert elevations to the highest mountain areas in Bears Ears, there's evidence of 10,000 years of human occupation, said Lyle Balenquah, a Hopi archeologist who has studied the area extensively.

""There has never been a time when the whole region has never been occupied by some Indigenous group, all the way back into the Paleolithic era and into the modern era,"" Balenquah said. ""It contains one of the densest concentrations of archaeological sites in the Southwest.""

Small groups of archeologists have drawn maps in recent years, photographed multiple sites and analyzed a number of artifacts but Bears Ears remains scarcely documented, Balenquah said.

Hikers look around the House on Fire Indian ruins in Mule Canyon, which is part of the Bears Ears National Monument.

Surveying such a sprawling area is considered a daunting task for any archeologists and Trump's decision made it even more challenging. A significant portion of Bears Ears became vulnerable to the drilling industry and threatened by irresponsible tourism.

While the original boundaries of the monument would have prevented new oil and gas exploration or mining in more than 1 million acres, the change left roughly 85% open to new leases.

No oil, gas or coal leases have been issued within the current Bears Ears boundaries or for those lands excluded by the Trump declaration since the original designation in 2016, said Richard Packer, a spokesman with the Bureau of Land Management.

The controversy over the monument's boundaries has drawn even more visitors, making archeologists refocus their work to high traffic areas.

""We know it's old but for the everyday visitor that comes in, they don't know how old it is and they may not realize how fragile these areas are,"" Balenquah said. ""They may not understand that the only reason why some of these places are still standing is because nobody has been visiting them for long periods of time.""

Unlike national parks or other monuments, there are no signs telling visitors that they've entered Bears Ears. Federal officials have not built trailhead signs, fences or bathrooms for visitors.

""You could just walk right up to this 800-900 cliff dwelling,"" said Josh Ewing, executive director of local nonprofit group Friends of Cedar Mesa.

Fearing that scores of visitors would damage the landscape, Friends of Cedar Mesa raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to build and operate a visitors center. Volunteers have built fences to keep animals out of some archeological sites, filled eroded areas with soil, remove graffiti and hike through the monument to teach proper etiquette to visitors, Ewing said.

As an archeologist, Balenquah says he knows it's important to preserve Bears Ears because it's key to understand Indigenous history. As a Hopi person, he can't let his culture and his ancestors' representation be erased.

""We have stories, songs, prayers and ceremonies that talk about these ancestral places,"" Balenquah said. ""We feel that we should have a greater say in how that landscape is managed and a greater role in whatever the Biden administration chooses to do."""
Peeps will be back for Easter after a 9-month hiatus,"New York (CNN Business) After a pandemic break, Peeps are back in production for Easter.

Candy maker Just Born Quality Confections announced Wednesday that the sugary treats are returning to shelves just in time for the holiday, after a nine-month hiatus because of the pandemic.

Just Born decided in April to stop production to protect employees' health as the pandemic took root in the US, the company previously told CNN Business. Consumers missed out on a variety of holiday-themed Peeps as a result, including for Halloween, Christmas and this year's Valentine's Day.

But now Peeps production is back in full force, with the company producing several old favorites and two new flavors inspired by Hot Tamales candy and Froot Loops cereal.

Easter is a good time for Just Born to bring them back, as Peeps have been the No. 1 non-chocolate brand at Easter for more than 20 years, according to the company.

How Covid-19 vaccines work,"(CNN) Data on vaccines being tested by Johnson & Johnson and Novavax came out last week, and makers of AstraZeneca 's vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine published some long-awaited details about their shots on Tuesday.

All indicate high efficacy against the virus, even though they take very different approaches.

Here's how some of the top coronavirus vaccines and vaccine candidates work.

Pfizer/BioNTech

Pfizer and its German-based partner BioNTech use a new approach to making vaccines that uses messenger RNA or mRNA.

This design was chosen for a pandemic vaccine years ago because it's one that lends itself to quick turnaround. All that is needed is the genetic sequence of the virus causing the pandemic. Vaccine makers don't even need the virus itself -- just the sequence.

In this case, BioNTech researchers used a little piece of genetic material coding for a piece of the spike protein -- those studs that cover the surface of the coronavirus and the source of its name. Corona means ""crown.""

Messenger RNA is a single strand of the genetic code that cells can ""read"" and use to make a protein. In the case of this vaccine, the mRNA instructs the muscle cells in the arm to make a particular piece of the virus's spike protein called the receptor binding domain. Then the immune system sees it, recognizes it as foreign and is prepared to attack when actual infection occurs.

""RNA is like snapchat messages that expire. RNA vaccines do NOT become a permanent part of your body. They are temporary messages instructing cells to make one viral protein temporarily,"" Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, said on Twitter.

""It takes 25 different coronavirus proteins to make a coronavirus, so there is no worry about the RNA making a virus.""

Clinical trials showed Pfizer's vaccine was 95% effective in preventing symptomatic infections. Pfizer is working to show the vaccine can prevent all infections, including those that don't cause symptoms. It has also been testing its vaccine against some of the worrying new variants of coronavirus. So far, the studies indicate the vaccine can protect against variants causing concern in South Africa and the UK.

MRNA is very fragile so it's encased in lipid nanoparticles -- a coating of a buttery substance that can melt at room temperature. That's why Pfizer's vaccine must be kept at ultracold temperatures of about minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 75 degrees Celsius). That means special equipment is needed to transport and store this vaccine.

Pfizer's vaccine won FDA EUA in December and is being delivered to millions of people in the US and UK. The US government has contracted to buy 300 million doses of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine.

Side-effects from vaccination are rare and usually mild. They include fever and headache, although a very few people have experienced allergic reactions to the vaccine. It's not clear what causes the allergic reaction, and the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating.

Moderna

Moderna's vaccine is also based on mRNA. ""mRNA is like software for the cell,"" Moderna said on its website.

And like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, it codes for cells to make a piece of the spike protein.

The Moderna vaccine also goes into the muscle cells of the arm, and perhaps to nearby immune system cells, and instructs them to make pieces of spike protein.

Clinical trials showed Moderna's vaccine was 94% effective in preventing symptomatic infections and the company says it has data showing the vaccine also prevents all infections, including those that do not cause symptoms.

Moderna thinks its vaccine will protect against the coronavirus for at least a year

Moderna has come up with a different formulation for the lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA in its vaccine. These formulations are corporate secrets, but Moderna thinks its approach is better and said its vaccine can be shipped at minus 20 degrees C (minus 4 degrees F) and can be kept stable for 30 days at 2 degrees to 8 degrees C (36 to 46F), the temperature of a standard home refrigerator.

The FDA authorized Moderna's vaccine in December. The US government has contracted to purchase 200 million doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine, and is in talks to purchase another 100 million doses.

Johnson & Johnson's vaccine arm, Janssen Pharmaceuticals

Janssen's coronavirus vaccine is a recombinant vector vaccine. It uses a genetically engineered version of adenovirus 26, which can cause the common cold, but the gene tinkering has disabled it. It also delivers the genetic instructions to make a piece of spike protein.

This is one vaccine that has been tested on the market before. The adenovirus 26 vector was used to make the company's Ebola vaccine, which won marketing authorization from the European Commission in July.

It's the only vaccine tested as a single shot -- a significant advantage in a world complicated by the need to ensure people get two carefully spaced doses of vaccine. Plus, it can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures.

Preliminary data released last week showed the vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial, but 72% effective in the US trial. Plus, it was 85% effective in preventing severe disease, and almost completely effective in preventing death.

""A vaccine that's inexpensive, that's a single dose, and that has no cold chain requirements -- that's pretty good,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN.

Johnson & Johnson is expected to apply for emergency use authorization this week. The company said expects to supply 100 million vaccine doses to the US government in the first half of 2021.

The company is also testing a two-dose regimen in volunteers to see if adding a second dose gives better or longer-lasting protection.

AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca's vaccine, made with a team at Britain's University of Oxford, is, like Janssen's, a vector vaccine. It uses an adenovirus that infects chimpanzees, but doesn't make people sick, to carry the spike protein from the coronavirus into cells.

It was modified so that it doesn't replicate itself, then genetically engineered to inject cells with the DNA encoding for the full coronavirus spike protein.

It's a cheaper way to make vaccines -- but slower than using RNA. The company has pledged to make its vaccine available inexpensively to countries around the world. The vaccine can be kept stable for six months at standard refrigerator temperatures, the company said.

It's approved in Britain but the US FDA is waiting for data from US trials.

Data released from trials in Britain, South Africa and Brazil in a Lancet preprint Tuesday indicated it's about 67% effective at preventing symptomatic infection two weeks after two doses. But the Oxford team also tested some volunteers to see if they became infected at all, and said they think the vaccine prevents infections in general.

Plus, the studies indicated a single dose of vaccine prevented 76% of symptomatic infections for up to 90 days, and if more time passed between the first and second doses, the efficacy improved. When volunteers waited 12 weeks between doses, the vaccine's efficacy went up to 82%. A longer wait between doses would help get more people vaccinated, since the companies are struggling to keep up with demand.

Novavax

Maryland-based biotechnology company Novavax specializes in ""protein subunit"" vaccines. They use virus-like nanoparticles as a base and cover them with genetically engineered pieces of the coronavirus spike protein.

This is also a tried and true vaccine approach. A hepatitis B vaccine given to newborns is a protein subunit vaccine, as is the human papillomavirus or HPV vaccine and FluBlok, Sanofi's influenza vaccine.

Novavax uses an insect virus called a baculovirus to get the coronavirus spike protein into moth cells, which then produce the protein. This is harvested and mixed with an adjuvant -- an immune booster --based on saponin, found in soap bark trees.

A Phase 3 trial conducted in the UK showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 89%, the company said last week. It has not published any data yet, but announced results in a news release. The vaccine was found to have 95.6% efficacy against the original novel coronavirus and 85.6% against the variant first identified in the UK, known as B.1.1.7.

And a Phase 2b study conducted in South Africa indicated the vaccine was 60% effective against a variant circulating there and known as B.1.351 -- although efficacy went down if HIV-positive volunteers were included.

Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline

This is also a protein subunit vaccine, using Sanofi's FluBlok technology with a GlaxoSmithKline adjuvant. It also uses a baculovirus to grow little bits of spike protein.

Phase 1/2 trials showed the vaccine elicits an immune response in younger adults that's comparable to patients who recovered from Covid-19, but the vaccine did not produce the desired immune response in older adults. The companies plan to launch a new trial in February.

Sinovac and Sinopharm

Chinese company Sinovac's CoronaVac uses an inactivated virus -- one of the oldest methods for vaccinating people. Whole batches of coronavirus are grown, ""killed"" and then made into vaccine. Likewise, Sinopharm's vaccine uses an inactivated virus.

China's Center for Disease Control said this week that tests showed the Sinopharm vaccine was effective against the B.1.351 variant.

Sputnik V

Russian researchers were heavily criticized for rolling out the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine last year without providing any data to show it was safe or effective.

On Tuesday, interim data from a Phase 3 trial were finally published in the Lancet medical journal and showed the vaccine is 91.6% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 and 100% effective for preventing severe illness.

The vaccine is a two-dose adenoviral vector vaccine, with doses administered 21 days apart. It uses two common cold viruses called adenovirus 5 and adenovirus 26 to carry the genetic material for the spike protein into the body."
Canada will list the Proud Boys movement as a terrorist group,"Ottawa, Canada (CNN) Canada announced Wednesday that the Proud Boys will be designated as a terrorist entity along with 12 other groups.

The Proud Boys will be deemed an ""ideologically motivated violent extremist group"" along with three others: Atomwaffen Division, The Base and Russian Imperial Movement, the government said in a news release.

""Their violent actions and rhetoric are fueled by white supremacy, anti-Semitism, racism, homophobia, Islamophobia and misogyny, and unfortunately, often in combination of all of the above,"" said Public Safety Minister Bill Blair at a news conference Wednesday.

Government officials say the move will help Canada freeze the groups' financial assets and criminalize financing, training and recruitment for all such groups.

When asked about the new terrorist designation for the Proud Boys, Blair said that the events of January 6 on the US Capitol did initiate a ""political response"" in Canada, but that the decision was not political.

Morgan Wallen apologizes for racial slur as backlash grows,"(CNN) Morgan Wallen is apologizing after a video surfaced in which he reportedly used a racial slur and profanities.

The country singer, who in October was rescheduled from appearing on ""Saturday Night Live"" after breaking Covid-19 protocols, is seen on a video first posted by TMZ with a group outside of his Nashville home.

""Take care of this ""p*ssy-a** m*ther**ker"" -,"" Wallen can be heard saying, before adding ""take care of this p*ssy-a** n***er"" ,"" apparently in reference to one of the people with his group.

""I'm embarrassed and sorry. I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back,"" Wallen said in a statement. ""There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better.""

TMZ reported that one of Wallen's neighbors recorded the exchange.

SoulCycle instructor apologizes after being criticized for jumping the line to get Covid-19 vaccine,"(CNN) A popular SoulCycle instructor is apologizing for ""a terrible error in judgment"" after getting the Covid-19 vaccine.

Stacey Griffith, a New York-based instructor, said she drove one hour to Staten Island to get the Moderna vaccine, according to an Instagram post that has since been deleted but circulated online, credited to Griffith's account.

""Now I can teach @soulcycle with a little more faith that we're all gonna be ok if we get the (vaccine),"" her post read.

After her post and telling The Daily Beast that her role as an ""educator"" made her eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine, many were outraged with her decision because of how difficult it has been for other, vulnerable groups to get it themselves.

CNN reached out to Griffith but has not heard back."
British teenager Joseph Flavill fell into a 10-month coma before the pandemic. Now he's waking up,"London (CNN) Joseph Flavill slipped out of one world and woke up in another.

On March 1, 2020 , when the 19-year-old was struck by a car in Staffordshire, central England, the United Kingdom had recorded just 23 cases of a concerning new virus. The vast majority of Covid-19 infections were still confined to China, and the United States had confirmed just one death.

Sporting events, bars and restaurants teemed with life. And in Flavill's home country that day, newspaper front pages were leading not with the spreading disease, but on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement that he and his fiancée were expecting a child.

Weeks later, the world had ground to a halt. But everything that has happened since March 1 has passed Flavill by, even though he caught Covid-19 while unconscious.

Now, the teenager has begun to emerge from a 10-month coma -- elating his family but confronting them with a new question: How do you explain a year like no other?

""When he comes out of this, life will not be as he knows it at all,"" Flavill's aunt, Kate Yarbo, told CNN. ""How do you describe it?

""I think it's going to be a shock. We're all still processing it -- I'm not sure you can ever actually describe how this pandemic feels.""

The family's ordeal began just days before the rapid onslaught of cancellations, fatalities and lockdowns.

Flavill, a cricket and hockey fan, was preparing to visit Buckingham Palace in May to collect the Duke of Edinburgh youth achievement award. But a collision with a car left him with a traumatic brain injury to the back of his head, and he was rushed to a hospital in Leicester, central England.

Flavill had planned to visit Buckingham Palace in May to receive a youth achievement award.

Three weeks later, Britain was in lockdown -- meaning only his mother, Sharon Flavill, was permitted to visit him in hospital, at a distance, dressed head-to-toe in protective equipment. ""Life was suspended, and then lockdown happened,"" said Yarbo.

His mother is still waiting until it's safe to touch her son, who is now recovering at a care home.

The pandemic has drastically affected Flavill's hospital care, but it is unclear whether he has grasped his family's explanations as to why.

""How scary is it to (have nurses) in PPE when you don't understand what's going on?"" Yarbo asked.

""He's only ever going to understand it through our ability to describe it, and through news stories. The horror,"" she said. ""So many people have said it's like sitting watching a sci-fi film, isn't it? You couldn't write the pandemic as a film.""

""That's what it's going to be exactly like for Joseph ... never having to go through the fear and emotion we all had, because when you're looking at it afterwards, hopefully lots of the fear will be gone.""

'You want to hold his hand'

The rest of the family spoke to Flavill virtually, trying all they could to stimulate his brain through video and audio, enlisting the help of relatives and friends through the Joseph's Journey fundraising page.

""He's been in such pain, he's had seizures, it's been a horrible traumatic journey for him,"" Yarbo said. And then, in the past few days and weeks, a breakthrough came.

First, Flavill smiled when he was played audio recorded in a plane cockpit. Next came a Zoom call with his aunt. ""I was joking with him that one day he'll be able to talk, and reminiscing about our Cornwall holidays. I said, 'will you promise me your first word is going to be pasty?'"" Yarbo said, referring to the famous Cornish pastry. ""And then he blinked.""

""Something just turned in my tummy. I said 'did you blink on purpose?' and he blinked twice. Then we knew he was communicating.""

Since then, his progress has been rapid.

""The last week has been incredible,"" Yarbo said. ""He can't speak yet but clearly he's starting to gain control of his limbs, and his sense of humor's there, he's starting to laugh at jokes.""

""We're all really stunned, it's amazing what the brain can do.""

Flavill caught Covid-19 while in a coma, which has prevented him from receiving a vaccine, but he will soon be eligible for a jab, his aunt says.

His family have also discussed how to talk to him about the news of the past 10 months, once he's fully able to comprehend it.

""We'll be led by the personal feelings: Did you know we weren't there?"" she said. ""That's a big thing for his mum to emotionally manage, watching him through a screen. You want to hold his hand, you want to be there all the time.""

Flavill will be one of very few adults in the Western world to learn of the pandemic secondhand. But he will also learn of the lengths to which his family and friends went in their quest to communicate with him again.

London's streets lay deserted in late March, just weeks after Flavill slipped into a coma.

They have raised nearly £33,000 ($45,000) to help with the costs associated with his care once he leaves hospital, many of which are still unknown. ""Nobody knows what the long-term impact will be, but we do know that the journey could be long and costly,"" they wrote on their website.

His mother, Sharon, has received audio and video clips from well-wishers to play to her son, some of which may have contributed to his progress, his aunt says.

And the family say they have another aim -- to raise awareness of the impact of traumatic brain injuries.

""The thing about Joe is that he was always such an energy force. He is the most determined person,"" Yarbo said. ""Who knows how far he's going to go now."""
Elon Musk admits Tesla has quality problems,"New York (CNN Business) Critics have slammed Tesla for Model 3 quality issues for years. And now CEO Elon Musk is admitting even his harshest critic was right.

In early 2018 engineering consultant Sandy Munro, who tears apart and reverse-engineers cars to assess quality, issued a brutal appraisal of the Model 3 citing ""flaws that we would see on a Kia in the '90s."" He noted inconsistencies such as uneven gaps between exterior panels and paint job issues, telling Autoline , ""I can't imagine how they released this.""

""I thought your criticism was accurate,"" Musk told Munro in an interview that aired Tuesday on the YouTube channel and podcast "" Munro Live .""

In the interview Musk also admitted that it might not be a good idea to buy a Tesla during a new model's ramp-up period. Munro's ""Kia"" critique came when Tesla was still struggling to meet early production targets for the Model 3.

Musk's admission is quite a warning considering that the company is getting ready to start production of the Cybertruck pickup late this year, and is set to open new plants outside of Austin, Texas , and Berlin, Germany

""Friends ask, 'When should I buy a Tesla?'"" Musk said. ""Well, either buy it right at the beginning or when production reaches steady state. During that production ramp, it's super hard to be in vertical climb mode and get everything right on the details.""

Munro also questioned Musk about quality control problems more recently. He bought a 2021 Model 3 late last year, and compared it to a Model 3 someone else purchased a month later -- and saw significant improvement.

""At the end of the day, this guy's car was fabulous ... as good as anybody could possibly do,"" Munro said. ""I just don't understand. Mine was built this month, his was built a month later. Mine had problems. His was perfect.""

Musk said Tesla continued to make progress even as recently as December of last year, noting that the company is finding issues more quickly as the pace of production continues to speed up.

""When you go faster, you just discover these things,"" he said. ""If we knew them in advance, we'd fix them in advance.""

Musk also discussed some other challenges that the company has previously experienced. After Munro praised the seats in the Model 3 as the most comfortable he has ever experienced in a car, Musk volunteered that he used to refer to the seat in the early Model S, one of the company's first vehicles, as a ""stone toadstool.""

""The early Model S's probably had the worst seat of any car I ever sat in,"" Musk said."
Supreme Court deals setback to Holocaust victims in art disputes,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday wiped away lower court decisions that had gone in favor of Holocaust victims and family members who are seeking to bring suit in US courts against Hungary and Germany for property they say was stolen from them during World War II.

The court said lawyers for the victims had not reached the necessary bar to prove their claim falls under an exception to a federal law that generally provides immunity to foreign states from suit in US courts. The justices sent the cases back to the lower courts to allow victims to press other arguments in their favor.

In the case concerning Germany, Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for a unanimous court, said: ""As a Nation, we would be surprised -- and might even initiate reciprocal action -- if a court in Germany adjudicated claims by Americans that they were entitled to hundreds of millions of dollars because of human rights violations committed by the United States Government years ago.""

The first case involving Hungary was initially brought in 2010 by 14 Jewish survivors -- including four United States citizens -- who sued Hungary and its state run railway company in US courts seeking compensation for the property that was stolen from their families in 1941. They said their possessions and those of their families were taken from them as they boarded trains destined for concentration camps and they seek to represent a class of victims who have been injured in similar ways.

The plaintiffs said that while the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act generally provides immunity to foreign states from suit in US courts, their case falls into an exception because the goods were stolen in violation of international law. But lawyers for Hungary said that such litigation would interfere with the foreign policy of the United States, and that US courts have long dismissed such claims so as to avoid ""international discord.""

Georgia state GOP lawmakers introduce voting restriction legislation,"Washington (CNN) GOP state senators in Georgia introduced a slate of bills on Monday that seek to roll back voter access in the state, such as ""no excuse"" absentee voting and automatic voter registration.

If passed, the nine proposed measures -- which follow elections where Democrats made historic gains in the state -- could considerably reshape Georgia's electorate and have a significant impact on the 2022 midterm elections. Republicans, echoing a baseless argument frequently made by former President Donald Trump, claim that the measures are necessary to prevent voter fraud, even though no evidence exists that it played a factor in the outcome of the 2020 election.

One of the bills would require an excuse to vote absentee, undoing a 2005 Republican-backed law allowing no-excuse absentee voting. Under the bill, voters would need to be 75 years old or older, absent from their precinct, observing a religious holiday, have a physical disability, be required to provide constant care for someone with a physical disability, or required to work ""for the protection of the health, life, or safety of the public during the entire time the polls are open"" to qualify to vote absentee.

The bills would also ban ballot drop boxes and require voters to provide identification when they request an absentee ballot application. Another one of the bills would limit who can distribute absentee ballot applications to Georgia election officials and campaigns, blocking outside groups and nonprofit organizations from sending applications to voters.

Other measures introduced by state Republican lawmakers would expand poll watcher access, prohibit new Georgia residents from voting in runoffs, and mandate monthly updates to election officials of voters who have died.

"Teachers have lost colleagues to Covid-19 and worry about being next. But, they say, no one's listening","(CNN) Were it not for the health benefits, Aimeé Gotreaux says she would have already resigned from her job as a special education teacher in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Ever since her school district announced a return to in-person classes last October, the 26-year-old has been frustrated by the decisions made by local and state leaders.

She was angry that she wasn't given an option to continue working remotely, despite being the primary caregiver for a mother with lung cancer. She was uncomfortable with the high coronavirus case numbers in the county, coupled with a lack of testing for employees and students. Then three educators in her district died of Covid-19 within the span of a month , and she was upset at seeing business continue as usual.

""What is the magic number for them?"" Gotreaux said. ""How many teachers are they going to let die before they say, 'OK, this is a problem?'""

The past few months as a teacher have made her feel disposable, she said. So once her unpaid medical leave expires, Gotreaux plans to leave her job -- and possibly the profession.

Though cases of teachers quitting over Covid-19 concerns are rare , Gotreaux isn't alone in feeling expendable. In districts around the country, several teachers who spoke to CNN reported being at their wits' end: constantly being asked to do more with less while feeling like their anxieties aren't being heard.

On top of all that, they're seeing colleagues getting sick and even dying of Covid-19 -- and worry they or their loved ones could be next.

Hundreds of educators have died of Covid-19

There's no definitive number that records exactly how many teachers, administrators and school employees have died of Covid-19, though new reports of deaths seem to surface with increasing frequency.

Various unions have compiled their own statistics. The American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation's largest teachers' unions, estimates more than 530 of their members died of the virus last year. But one of the more extensive efforts to track educator deaths from Covid-19 comes from a memorial run by the trade publication Education Week.

""We felt a duty and responsibility to remember and to document as best we could the teachers, the bus drivers, the principals, the key people who keep our schools operating day in and day out,"" Lesli Maxwell, managing editor of Education Week, told CNN.

As of February 1, the site estimates that at least 707 retired and active teachers, coaches, custodians and other staff members have died of Covid-19.

Crucially, that number doesn't account for whether an employee was exposed to the virus at school or in some other setting. There's also no evidence to suggest more teachers are dying than people in other professions. In fact, recent studies have concluded that in-person classes aren't significantly contributing to coronavirus spread -- an in-depth look at two US schools released last week found that there ""was no evidence of student-to-teacher or teacher-to-student transmission"" when proper precautions were taken.

Still, the loss to the profession, said Maxwell, is noteworthy.

""Every death in this pandemic matters,"" she added. ""Every one of these people matters and should be remembered.""

She finds it hard to sleep on Sunday nights

The deaths so far are enough to worry educators and school staff in some districts.

Cree Hare, an elementary school counselor in the Georgia district where three educators recently died, has been working in person since October.

A colleague of hers was married to one of the teachers who passed away of Covid-19. Hare, who is 43, said she knows how seriously the couple took the pandemic, but it still cost her coworker's husband his life.

For Hare, having three educators die in a month is a clear indication that the school district should be fully virtual for the time being. But she said nothing much has changed.

So each Sunday, as the prospect of making it through another work week looms over her, Hare said she finds it difficult to sleep. The fact that her husband, also an educator, is still recovering from Covid-19 doesn't help.

""You are risking your life every day going to work,"" she said. ""I don't feel like people have compassion towards that or if they truly understand that that is what we do.""

She's mourning her colleague's death

For Isabel Alvarado Vasquez, a second grade teacher in San Antonio, Texas, the loss has hit close to home.

Recently, a teacher at another school in Vasquez's district -- a woman she worked with for four years in a previous job -- died of complications from Covid-19. Losing a colleague to the virus encapsulates many of the safety concerns that Vasquez and her coworkers have been feeling in recent weeks.

""What made her life any less than any of these huge companies that are having their employees work from home?"" Vasquez asked. ""Why are we so insignificant?""

Alabama Teachers Against Covid-19 protest the reopening of schools in Montgomery, Alabama, on July 23, 2020.

The Texas school district where Vasquez works has been conducting in-person classes since September. Parents could choose whether their child attended virtually or in person, but teachers weren't given an option: They had to report to the building.

At first, Vasquez, who is 49, said she was willing to give the arrangement a try. Coronavirus cases in San Antonio were relatively low at the time, and teachers had been assured that schools would go fully online again if infections got out of hand, she said. But when Covid-19 cases began rising sharply around December, that didn't happen.

Dax Gonzalez, division director of governmental relations for the Texas Association of School Boards, said that local school trustees are balancing the competing needs of their communities, administrators and teachers. There's pressure from state leaders, too.

To qualify for state funding, every school district in Texas is required to offer an in-person learning option unless the state makes an exception due to high coronavirus spread. If a significant number of students elect to be in the classroom in a given district, in-person teaching staff will be needed to support them.

And then there are parents who fear that remote learning is causing children to fall behind or who cannot afford other child care arrangements during the day.

""It's certainly not a lack of empathy,"" Gonzalez said, of the decisions that school leaders are making. ""When you're responsible for the education of 5.4 million children across the state, there are sometimes going to be decisions that not everyone's happy with.""

Vasquez said she recognizes the difficult choices that school officials have to make. But in that delicate balancing act, she said, she feels that the concerns of teachers aren't given the same consideration.

""We almost feel as if we are being selfish if we're saying we're afraid to get sick,"" she said while choking up.

He worries about infecting family members

Christopher Terrazas, who teaches English and language arts to sixth graders in the same San Antonio school district, considers teaching his true calling and cares deeply about his students.

But since students at his school started returning to the classroom, the 24-year-old says he's felt unsafe. The culture around social distancing and other safety protocols seemed to ease up over time, with no one strictly enforcing the rules, he said. Then the notices about Covid-19 cases at the school started coming in, including two in his own classroom.

Terrazas, who lives with his mother, grandparents and sisters, said he worried about putting his family members at risk.

""It feels scary to go to your job and not know if you could catch this deadly virus and potentially bring it back home to family members who are already vulnerable,"" he said.

Terrazas knows there are no easy answers, and that parents and students are struggling too. But, in challenging situations such as these, he said he would appreciate teachers being consulted.

""When decisions are made about the lives of teachers, teachers need to be involved in those discussions,"" he said.

Some teachers have few options besides quitting

Whether to teach K-12 students virtually, in-person or through a combination of the two is an issue that has divided people in many of the nation's largest school districts . And how teachers feel about their situations -- and the recourse they have -- varies widely from district to district and region to region.

At least 25 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have made some or all teachers eligible for a coronavirus vaccine as of February 1, Education Week reports. But eligibility does not equal availability, and it could be a while before many of those educators get a shot.

Still, some officials and parents are pushing for a quicker return to in-person classes. Though some teachers fear being back in classrooms while the virus is still raging in their communities, other leaders argue that the educational toll on students and the stress on families are more urgent concerns.

Supporters of the Chicago Teachers Union prepare for a car caravan on January 30.

Kevin Brown, executive director of the Texas Association of School Administrators, said he understands how educators are feeling. Though the former school superintendent currently represents other superintendents and administrators, he's been a teacher and principal, too.

In Brown's view, schools in his state have engaged in ""very heroic efforts"" to make things work, reducing class sizes, arranging food delivery for students in need and disinfecting and sanitizing buildings.

""That said, we've had teachers, coaches, principals, and superintendents get ill on a pretty regular basis and die,"" Brown said. ""It's a pretty tragic thing to be happening in our country right now.""

Superintendents are doing the best they can, but they're dealing with a lose-lose situation, he said. For his part, his organization is advocating that the state prioritize teachers for the Covid-19 vaccine. But he knows that the current situation is testing teacher morale.

In states such as Texas and Georgia, there's not much teachers can do about situations in which they feel unsafe besides resigning. Still, educators there are finding ways to make their voices heard.

In September, a local teachers' association in central Texas filed a grievance with their district over what they referred to as unsafe conditions. In October, more than 100 teachers in Austin stayed home on the first day of in-person classes despite the district's orders. That same month, a Georgia teacher sued state leaders and local school officials for allegedly putting students, staff and families at risk.

In places with strong teachers' unions, educators have more power

Chicago's planned return to in-person classes was pushed back a day after the school district and teachers' union failed to reach an agreement. Philadelphia's plan to return on February 22 could also face uncertainty if the teachers' union isn't on board. And unions in West Virginia and New Jersey have responded to reopening plans with similar pushback.

So, some are planning to step down

Gotreaux, the special education teacher in Georgia, said she's been in a process of mourning ever since she decided to eventually leave her job.

She's wanted to be a teacher for as long as she can remember, and isn't really sure what other options exist for her. But given how events have unfolded in her district after the death of three educators, submitting her resignation letter won't be hard.

Gotreaux said she was on the fence about it until she heard that the superintendent and some board members at a school board meeting refused a request to put on a mask in honor of one of the fallen teachers. The district has said board members were in compliance with a policy that allowed people to have their masks off as long as they were physically distanced.

But for Gotreaux her and other colleagues, it was ""the straw that broke the camel's back.""

""It's us, the teachers and staff trying to stay alive, versus them, the board members who refuse to acknowledge what we're going through and the board members who refuse to work in the office,"" she said.

Gotreaux said she feels immense guilt over the decision, knowing that some people might believe that she just wanted extra time off -- or that she didn't care enough about her students.

She does care about her students. But she wishes school officials cared about their teachers."
House Republican leader punts on punishing Marjorie Taylor Greene as Democrats move toward removing her from committees,"(CNN) House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy broke his silence on Wednesday over the uproar caused by freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's conspiracy theory views, suggesting Republicans would not move to strip her from her committee assignments, effectively forcing Democrats to take action on their own.

Yet Greene has allied herself with Trump, and many House Republicans say she shouldn't be punished for views expressed before she was an elected member of Congress -- even as lawmakers in both parties are alarmed at revelations that she suggested school massacres were staged events and made many other shocking and racist claims.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, made the first move toward stripping Greene of her roles on two important House committees after speaking with McCarthy on Wednesday.

""I spoke to Leader McCarthy this morning, and it is clear there is no alternative to holding a Floor vote on the resolution to remove Rep. Greene from her committee assignments,"" Hoyer said in a statement. ""The Rules Committee will meet this afternoon, and the House will vote on the resolution tomorrow.""

Hours later, McCarthy answered Hoyer's action by announcing no new repercussions for Greene with a statement that amounted to a slap on the wrist for the first-term Republican and spent more time criticizing Democrats than her past comments questioning if the Pentagon was struck by a plane in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, advocating for the assassination of top Democrats or calling a high-profile school shooting a ""false flag"" operation.

McCarthy said in a statement on Wednesday that Greene's past statements ""do not represent the values or beliefs of the House Republican Conference."" But he did not announce any sanction against Greene, instead saying he would ""hold her to her word"" that she would be more careful with her comments going forward.

McCarthy's statement mostly attacked Democrats for Hoyer's move to strip Greene of her committee assignments.

""I understand that Marjorie's comments have caused deep wounds to many and as a result, I offered Majority Leader Hoyer a path to lower the temperature and address these concerns. Instead of coming together to do that, the Democrats are choosing to raise the temperature by taking the unprecedented step to further their partisan power grab regarding the committee assignments of the other party,"" McCarthy said, going on to repeat several attacks on Democratic members.

Concerns rise in House GOP

The statement is unlikely to calm any fears among GOP members, who are growing nervous that his lack of action could embolden fringe members in the conference, damage the party's reputation and ultimately serve as a long-term distraction that will endanger their ability to win back the House in 2022.

A senior Republican House member, speaking on condition of background in order to freely discuss the ongoing going discussions, told CNN ""if he doesn't act, he's going to continue to look indecisive.""

Another Republican member familiar with the process, had a more colorful assessment: ""Either he has sh** the bed on this thing or he shows he's going to get us through this. We have to deal with our own House. We have to clean up the mess in our own House.""

That member argued that if McCarthy doesn't take decisive action, he will force his own Republican conference to walk the plank when Democrats force a resolution that would remove Greene of her committee assignments . It's a tough vote and one that would force every single member to decide if they stand with Greene or not.

""It's the job of leadership to protect our rank-and-file members,"" the member said.

Hoyer explained on a call with reporters later Wednesday the thinking behind the vote stripping Greene of her committee assignments.

""She has placed many members in fear for their welfare and she has attacked and made incendiary remarks prior to but also during her term as a member of Congress with respect to the safety and welfare of the Speaker of the House and others in the House. And we believe she also gave aid and comfort to those who led an insurrection,"" Hoyer said. ""The language that she has used, in many respects, goes far beyond the remarks that Steve King made through the years.""

Still, McCarthy is walking a fine line, needing to strike a position on Greene that won't alienate some of his most conservative members of the Republican conference, unleash the ire of former President Donald Trump or set a precedent that allows representatives to be pulled from committees for comments they made before they were in Congress.

One member argued that while Greene's comments were ""bat**** crazy,"" she made them before she was in Congress and that makes it harder for McCarthy to act.

""We need to be thoughtful. I'd like to see her be a productive member of Congress,"" the person said before adding ""I don't know if that is possible.""

Greene refuses to show remorse

When Greene was handed committee assignments weeks ago, the thinking among members and leadership was that it would provide the congresswoman a chance to prove she could do the work and move past her conspiracy-theory ridden past.

The thinking -- before it was resurfaced that she'd harassed a Parkland survivor on Capitol Hill and argued the shooting was a false flag event -- was that the House Committee on Education and Labor would put her under the tutelage of Rep. Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican with a reputation for running a tight ship and standing up against colleagues who step out of line. Greene was then put on Budget where the top Republican, Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, had a reputation for helping new members understand the intricacies of how Congress worked.

As more and more information about Greene's past came out and as the congresswoman showed no remorse, the issue of keeping her on the committees appears to have become untenable.

Following his meeting with Greene on Tuesday, McCarthy summoned the powerful Steering Committee for a late-night meeting. The GOP steering panel can remove Republican House members from their committee posts, but two officials with direct knowledge of the meeting told CNN that the committee did not make a decision as of Tuesday night.

During his meeting with Greene, McCarthy asked if she would apologize for her past comments and views, which she did not agree to, a person with knowledge of the matter told CNN. Another person familiar with their conversation also said that McCarthy provided a slew of options to her, including that she could show remorse and apologize.

McCarthy and the steering committee also discussed other options, including forcing her off just the Education Committee but letting her stay on the Budget Committee, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.

Officials said the Steering Committee will meet again Wednesday to see if they can come to a decision. Greene did not meet with the panel.

In relaying how the meeting with Greene went, the two officials who spoke with CNN on Tuesday night said that McCarthy gave no indication that Greene showed any remorse or contrition for her comments.

""And Kevin McCarthy and all these leaders, the leadership, and everyone is proving that they are all talk and not about action and they're just all about doing business as usual in Washington. And so what's the difference between them and the Democrats? There isn't a difference,"" she said.

Greene told the Examiner Democrats are ""stupid"" for moving toward stripping her of her committee assignments, adding, ""I'm pretty amazed at how dumb they are."" She said she's not worried about losing her assignments.

""Oh no, it doesn't hurt me at all, I think it's going to give me more time on my hands, I think, which is fantastic because then I can gain more support, I can help really get Republicans running in these primaries and elections in 2022,"" Greene said.

Some come to Greene's defense in closed-door meeting

The congresswoman was more conciliatory when speaking to the House Republican Conference Wednesday night. According to a person in the room, she said that her social media posts do not reflect who she is as a person.

Following her remarks to the caucus, about half of those in attendance clapped and stood up for her, commending the Georgia freshman on how she addressed the controversy, according to a separate source in the room.

Several GOP House members came to Greene's defense during the meeting, additional people in the room said, echoing many arguments that have become commonplace in the last week -- largely focusing on how she made the controversial remarks before being elected. Some lawmakers argued that Democrats have also said offensive things and Republicans shouldn't disregard voters who sent her to Congress, those people said.

It was a stark difference compared to the reception Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, was receiving in the meeting. Cheney, who is under fire from Trump-backing lawmakers in her party over her vote to impeach the former President, recceived far less support. One of the people in the room said it seemed as if Republicans who were almost certain to vote for her are not speaking out loud on her behalf. A handful of critics voiced their concern with Cheney, saying she has a right to her own vote, but adding that they believe she doesn't represent the views of the conference and shouldn't be in leadership, the people said.

It's unclear if removing Greene from committee spots will be seen by some in the GOP as too far. Rep. Jim Banks, who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee, told CNN that ""it's a slippery slope"" to strip Greene from her committee spots, echoing arguments many of his GOP colleagues are making.

McCarthy told reporters on Wednesday that he had suggested to Hoyer putting her on the House Small Business Committee, but the minority leader signaled he did not think Greene should be punished for comments made before her time in office.

""This was before she was ever elected. They were concerned about her being on Ed, Workforce and Labor,"" McCarthy told reporters. ""And Marjorie's also a small business owner. Move her to Small Business. I made that offer to Democrats and they chose to do something that Congress has never done, and if they are going to pick people based on what they said before, are they going to hold them to the same standard to what people said now?""

US drops discrimination lawsuit against Yale,"(CNN) The Justice Department on Wednesday dropped an affirmative action lawsuit the Trump administration had filed against Yale University last year accusing the school of discriminating against Asian American and White applicants in its undergraduate admissions process.

The lawsuit was originally filed in October when the department, led by then-Attorney General William Barr, alleged: ""Yale rejects scores of Asian American and white applicants each year based on their race.""

The decision to drop this lawsuit is the latest move by the Biden administration to change its positions in several cases that are pending in federal courts around the country. The new administration also recently asked the Supreme Court to pause arguments in cases involving the US-Mexico border wall and US asylum policy.

The case against Yale came on the heels of a similar case against Harvard University, where an anti-affirmative action group sued the university claiming their admissions practices discriminated against Asian American students. Lower courts ruled Harvard does not discriminate in its admission decisions.

""The department has dismissed its lawsuit in light of all available facts, circumstances, and legal developments, including the November 2020 decision by the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejecting a challenge to Harvard University's consideration of race in its admissions practices,"" a DOJ spokesperson said in a statement.

Black people in history: Little-known figures to know,"Cycling is viewed mostly as a White sport. But one of the fastest men ever to race on two wheels was Marshall Walter “Major” Taylor, an American who dominated sprint cycling in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

A hugely gifted rider, Taylor won the first amateur race he entered, at 14. He turned professional four years later and continued winning races, most of them sprints around oval tracks at Madison Square Garden and other arenas in the eastern US.

Soon Taylor was competing in races across Europe and Australia, becoming the second Black athlete to win a world championship in any sport.

He did all this while battling bitter racial prejudice – often from White cyclists who refused to compete against him or tried to harm him during races. One rival, after losing to Taylor in Boston, attacked him and choked him unconscious.

“In most of my races I not only struggled for victory but also for my very life and limb,” Taylor wrote in his autobiography.

But this didn’t stop him from setting world records, drawing huge crowds and becoming perhaps the first Black celebrity athlete."

A congressional tribute for fallen US Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick is being held in the building's famous Rotunda.

The officer died due to injuries suffered in the Jan. 6 insurrection on the Capitol.

Sicknick joined the USCP in July 2008, and most recently served in the Department's First Responder's Unit. Sicknick was originally from South River, New Jersey, and the youngest of three sons, according to a statement issued by his brother, Ken Sicknick, on behalf of his family.

Sicknick's family was ""very proud"" of his service to his country, Ken Sicknick said.

""Brian is a hero, and that is what we would like people to remember,"" he said.

Sicknick ""wanted to be a police officer his entire life"" and joined the New Jersey National Guard in his pursuit of that goal, Ken Sicknick said.

According to a statement from New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office, Sicknick was a staff sergeant for the New Jersey National Guard.

He served as a fire team member and a leader of the 108th Security Force Squadron, 108th Wing, at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Murphy's statement said.

Sicknick's service included two deployments — one as part of Operation Southern Watch and another as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Murphy said.

""Officer Sicknick gave his life protecting the United States Capitol, and by extension, our very democracy, from violent insurrection,"" Murphy said."
Gun sales in January set a new record after Capitol Hill insurrection,"New York (CNN Business) The Capitol Hill insurrection and the inauguration of a Democratic president who campaigned on strengthening gun control measures helped the firearms industry set a January gun sales record last month, according to data released Monday.

Gun merchants sold more than 2 million firearms in January, a 75% increase over the estimated 1.2 million guns sold in January 2020, according to the National Shooting Sports Federation, a firearms industry trade group.

The FBI said it conducted a record 4.3 million background checks in January. If that pace continues, the bureau will complete more than 50 million gun-related background checks by the end of the year, shattering the current record set in 2020, according to a new report from Bespoke Investment Group.

The NSSF, which cross references reported background checks with actual sales figures to come up with its more-accurate, adjusted gun sales data, said three of the top 10 weeks for FBI instant criminal background checks came last month.

The only three months on record when more FBI gun background checks were conducted were January 2013, when Barack Obama was inaugurated for his second term in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre, and this past June and July following the police killing of George Floyd , according to the FBI."
Wall Street is keeping very close tabs on WallStreetBets. Here's how,"New York (CNN Business) Hedge funds, investment bankers and other institutional investors are desperate to find the next GameStop -- before it's too late.

That's why Thinknum Alternative Data quickly built and launched a tool that provides its hedge fund and investment bank clients a ranking of the most-mentioned stocks on WallStreetBets as well as the Stocks subreddit.

""The inbound inquiries from people asking about the dataset has been insane. I've never seen anything like it,"" Justin Zhen, Thinknum's co-founder and president, told CNN Business.

Thinknum's new offering shows how quickly Wall Street is adapting to this new phenomenon -- ensuring it maintains control, even as traders on Reddit believe they've gained the upper hand on the establishment.

GameStop GME AMC AMC Some hedge funds that bet againstand other stocks have been crushed by the Reddit-fueled rally. Those gains caused a massive short squeeze, where a stock climbed sharply, forcing those who bet against it to buy the stock back to avoid even greater losses.

""Everyone is saying, 'I need to track Reddit.' It's become one of the most important drivers of market movement,"" Zhen said.

BlackBerry BB As of Tuesday evening, the top mentioned stocks on Thinknum were GameStop, AMC and

Thinknum's new tool gives hedge funds and other sophisticated investors a view into what stock tickers are most talked about on Reddit's WallStreetBets and Stocks subreddits.

Thinknum is hardly the only Wall Street firm that has developed new ways to keep an eye on what retail investors and the WallStreetBets crowd are up to.

For instance, Nomura and Wolfe Research recently launched the Wolfe Retail Red Alert basket. According to Nomura, the tool analyzes Fidelity, Reddit and other sources of retail trading flows to monitor mentions and trading activity and measure that information against statistics on how heavily shorted stocks are.

'Bad things can happen'

CarMax KMX Founded in 2014, Thinknum lets users comb through 30 different datasets to make investment decisions, everything from vehicle inventory posted byand job postings to government contracts.

The platform has more than 130 hedge funds as clients as well as eight of the top 10 biggest banks, according to Zhen. Thinknum's pricing starts at $16,800 per seat per year and goes up from there based on how much data is consumed. Some clients pay six-figures per year for access to the platform.

The Thinknum president said hedge funds especially need to know if their short bets are being discussed on WallStreetBets, indicating a potential short squeeze in the works.

""If you don't know, then bad things can happen -- as you've seen recently,"" Zhen said.

Keeping an eye on Reddit

Of course, one risk with making investment decisions solely based on what is being mentioned on Reddit is that there is no way to confirm that the stocks being touted are actually being bought. Some WallStreetBets users claimed this week that hedge funds co-opted their movement by suggesting they were behind a surge in silver prices.

Rather than ascribing intention, Zhen said the tool is used to merely track how many mentions a stock gets on Reddit.

""You don't have to know who they are and whether they like the stock or not. The main thing is knowing that people are talking about the stock,"" the Thinknum president said.

Zhen added that demand was so strong for this tool that Thinknum created it in just days last week.

""I don't have to pitch it to clients,"" he said. ""It pitches itself."""
"CDC’s ensemble forecast now projects up to 534,000 US Covid-19 deaths by Feb. 27","A pharmacy technician prepares doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at a mass Covid-19 vaccination event on January 30, in Denver, Colorado. Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Good Morning America Wednesday that delaying second doses of Covid-19 vaccine so that as many people in the US can get a first dose is “not necessarily” what he recommends.

Fauci told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that it looks like there is going to be a much steadier supply or cadence of vaccines coming in through February and into March.

“Certainly you don’t want vaccines sitting around in the refrigerator or in a freezer if they’re ready to go, you want to give them to people,” Fauci said. “But if you balance it well, George, you can get as many people in their first doses and then when the next shipment comes in, take care of the people that are about due for their second and then give more to the first.”

“I think you can accelerate it without necessarily dramatically delaying the second dose,” Fauci said. “If you miss it by a few days to a week or two, I don’t think that’s a big problem, as the CDC says, but I’d be concerned about delaying it for three months or so.”

When asked about Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine data that found 76% efficacy up to three months following one dose and possible higher efficacy among more spaced-out doses, Fauci reminded that this a different type of vaccine from the mRNA vaccines already in use in the United States.

“You got to be careful because you’re dealing with different vaccine platforms,” he said, adding that the data that is available for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines “are solid” about getting a second shot 28 days and 21 days later, respectively.

“We know just from immunology in general that a little flexibility on either end of that is not going to be a big deal, however if you delay it longer you don’t know whether or not the efficacy is going to be maintained over a period of time, and you don’t know how low it’s going to go,” he said."
US extends nuclear arms treaty with Russia,"Washington (CNN) The United States has extended a key nuclear arms control treaty with Russia for five years, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday.

""Extending the New START Treaty makes the United States, U.S. allies and partners, and the world safer. An unconstrained nuclear competition would endanger us all,"" Blinken said.

The treaty -- the only one left regulating the two largest nuclear arsenals in the world -- was set to expire on February 5. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law extending the treaty for five years on Friday.

President Joe Biden made renewing the pact a priority when he entered office, even as he launched a review of Russian malfeasance ranging from the SolarWinds hack to the alleged bounties Moscow offered for the death of US troops in Afghanistan.

In a statement, Blinken said the extension of the New START Treaty allows for verifiable limits on Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers until February 5, 2026 and the treaty's ""verification regime enables us to monitor Russian compliance with the treaty and provides us with greater insight into Russia's nuclear posture, including through data exchanges and onsite inspections that allow U.S. inspectors to have eyes on Russian nuclear forces and facilities.""

Fact check: Trump's official response to impeachment includes obvious lies,"Washington (CNN) Former President Donald Trump continues to defend the ludicrous lie that led him down the road to a second impeachment -- even in his legal team's official response to that impeachment.

The legal team's initial written response to the House's article of impeachment against Trump, submitted to the Senate on Tuesday, focuses on debatable constitutional arguments, particularly the claim that someone who is no longer in office can't be convicted by the Senate. (Many legal scholars disagree .) But the response also includes defenses of some Trump claims that are very obviously not true -- including the bonkers claim that he actually won the election.

The old big lie

The House article of impeachment charges that Trump incited the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6. It alleges that earlier the same day, Trump made a nearby speech in which he repeated ""false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide.'""

The response from Trump lawyers Bruce L. Castor, Jr. and David Schoen ? Yes, Trump gave a speech and exercised his First Amendment right to express his opinion -- but if the House is alleging his opinion ""that the election results were suspect"" is factually inaccurate, Trump ""denies this allegation.""

That is, frankly, ridiculous. Trump lost fair and square. Joe Biden was legitimately elected president. Trump's opinion is factually inaccurate. The end.

Another section of the Trump team's response rejects the House's assertion that, in the months prior to January 6, Trump ""repeatedly issued false statements"" in which he claimed the ""election results were the product of widespread fraud."" The Trump team calls into question the legitimacy of pandemic-era changes in state and local election procedures, then argues: ""Insufficient evidence exists upon which a reasonable jurist could conclude that the 45th President's statements were accurate or not, and he therefore denies they were false.""

That is very, very wrong. There is copious evidence that numerous specific Trump claims about supposed fraud are false . And Trump and his allies have thoroughly failed, in court and elsewhere, to prove his vaguer conspiratorial claims that the election was ""rigged"" and ""stolen.""

Another big lie

The Trump team's response makes a third claim that is transparently false: ""It is denied President Trump made any effort to subvert the certification of the results of the 2020 Presidential election.""

Subvert can mean overturn, overthrow, undermine -- and whatever definition you choose, Trump clearly tried to do it.

We don't even have to get into Trump's prolonged behind-the-scenes effort to change the outcome of the election; he waged much of his campaign in public. For example, on the morning of January 6, the day of the insurrection and the certification, Trump tweeted that he wanted then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify the results: ""States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval. All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!""

In his rally speech later in the day, Trump urged Pence again to ""come through for us."" When Pence did not do so -- Pence never had the constitutional power to reject the certification of Biden's victory -- Trump criticized him in a second tweet

Trump probably won't face a Senate penalty for continuing to propagate his lies. Most Republicans in the 50-Republican, 50-Democrat Senate appear poised to vote against convicting him , and conviction requires the support of two-thirds of senators present.

But it's telling that Trump won't even stick to the truth when it's apparent he's probably going to win regardless."
Some good news from Britain on vaccines and transmission,"A version of this story appeared in the February 3 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday

(CNN) The Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca not only prevents people from developing symptomatic coronavirus infections, but also appears to slow down transmission of the coronavirus, researchers reported on Tuesday.

The findings, released in a preprint paper that has not yet been peer reviewed, are the first evidence that a Covid-19 vaccine can reduce the virus' spread, and underlines the importance of mass vaccination as a way out of the pandemic.

Researchers at the University of Oxford measured transmission by swabbing some participants every week to detect signs of the virus, and found that the rate of positive PCR tests declined by about half after two doses of the vaccine. If the vaccine were simply making infections more mild, PCR positivity would not change, the authors argued.

The study also found that a single shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine provided 76% protection against symptomatic Covid-19 when the second shot was delayed by up to three months, supporting the vaccination plan rolled out by Britain and other countries stretching time between the first and second doses (Note: The data does not mean the same will be true for other vaccines).

The researchers said spacing doses by three months was ""an effective strategy for reducing disease, and may be the optimal for rollout of a pandemic vaccine when supplies are limited in the short term."" That is good news, especially in the United Kingdom, where the race is on to vaccinate as much of the population as possible while a new, more transmissible variant spreads."
Read: Hill staffers sign letter urging senators to convict Trump at impeachment trial,(CNN) More than 370 congressional staffers from both the House and Senate have signed a letter advocating for former President Donald Trump's conviction. In the letter they detail their experiences during the riot at the Capitol on January 6.
Hundreds of congressional staffers sign letter to senators urging them to convict Trump,"(CNN) Hundreds of congressional staffers wrote an open letter to senators urging them to consider the trauma aides experienced during the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol and to convict former President Donald Trump ""for our sake, and the sake of the country.""

""We are staff who work for members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, where it is our honor and privilege to serve our country and our fellow Americans. We write this letter to share our own views and experiences, not the views of our employers. But on January 6, 2021, our workplace was attacked by a violent mob trying to stop the electoral college vote count. That mob was incited by former president Donald J. Trump and his political allies, some of whom we pass every day in the hallways at work,"" more than 370 staffers, who are predominantly Democrats, wrote in the letter released Wednesday.

Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives before he left office in January for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol, which forced lawmakers and staffers alike to evacuate their offices. Arguments in the Senate trial are set to begin next week, and House impeachment managers will argue that Trump is 'singularly responsible' for the riot, according to a brief they filed Tuesday.

""As Congressional employees, we don't have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our Senators do. And for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.""

Signers of the letter come from over 100 House offices, 15 Senate offices and 10 different committees, including the House Judiciary, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, according to the organizers.

America's inequality problem isn't new. The pandemic is just emphasizing it,"New York (CNN Business) The pandemic is shining a spotlight on America's inequality problem , but the nation's economic playing field was far from level long before the virus hit -- even as the US job market grew to its strongest point in 50 years.

Covid-19 exacerbated the wage, wealth and income inequality that that was already present

Politicians and economists are calling the recovery ""k-shaped,"" a recently created term that means prosperity is returning more rapidly for some Americans as many others struggle to get by. The terminology might be new, but America's economy has always been shaped that way.

""People worry about a k-shaped recovery to the pandemic -- and that is a cause for concern -- but long before Covid-19 infected a single individual, we were living in a k-shaped economy, one where wealth built on wealth while certain segments of the population fell further and further behind,"" said Treasury Secretary and former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in a message to her department's staff last week

Take home ownership, the bedrock of household net worth in America . It is vastly unequal: Nearly 75% of White households own their homes, compared to only 44% of Black households, according to data from the Census Bureau released Tuesday.

Although both White and Black homeownership has increased marginally over the past few years, oscillating in a narrow range since 2016, the gap between them hasn't narrowed perceptibly.

And even as the jobless rate fell to a historically low 3.5% right before the Covid-19 pandemic, Black and Hispanic workers still faced much higher rates of unemployment, and women were more likely than men to hold multiple jobs, often working part-time as well.

Before the pandemic, the US economy recorded more than a decade of growth -- its longest expansion in history . But wages only really began to rise appreciably toward the end of this expansion, helped in part by increases in the minimum wage, said Kate Bahn, economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, told CNN Business last month. The last time the federal minimum wage rose was in 2009, although some states have increased it since.

Wage inequality has been rising since the late 1970s in America, as the post-war economic growth burst slowed down. Since the turn of the millennium, wage growth has been strongest for higher-wage earners, according to the Economic Policy Institute

Then came the pandemic, which hit the weakest groups in the US economy especially hard.

Lower-paid workers, minority communities and women accounted for many of the workers in sectors most affected by lockdown measures. As of December , the jobless rates for Black and Hispanic workers were still far higher than the 6.7% national average -- at 9.9% and 9.3%, respectively. In fact, this trend has held true since the government started compiling jobs data by race.

The Biden administration acknowledges the disparities between different groups in America's economy. But it remains to be seen whether it can break this inequitable, decades-long trend."
Jobless Americans missed $17.6 billion in benefits last month because of relief bill delays,"(CNN) Jobless Americans missed out on billions of dollars of benefits last month because then-President Donald Trump and Congress did not finalize a coronavirus relief bill until the end of December .

And many may face another break in payments next month if lawmakers again wait until the last minute to approve yet another extension of key federal pandemic unemployment programs, which are set to start expiring in mid-March.

The unemployed were left waiting for $17.6 billion in benefits in January because it took states several weeks to update their computer systems with the new relief provisions, said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation, who co-authored an analysis of the fallout from the delay released Tuesday.

The $900 billion aid package lawmakers passed in late December provides a $300 weekly boost to unemployment benefits through the week ending March 13.

It also extends two pandemic unemployment programs for 11 weeks, with benefits starting to expire the week ending March 13. Payments will continue as late as the week ending April 10 for those who have not yet reached their maximum number of weeks.

Created by Congress in late March last year, the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program initially expanded jobless benefits to gig workers, freelancers, independent contractors, the self-employed and certain people affected by the coronavirus for up to 39 weeks. The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program initially provided an extra 13 weeks of payments to those who exhaust their regular state benefits.

Now, with the economic recovery still on shaky ground, President Joe Biden wants to bump the federal weekly enhancement to $400 and extend it and the two pandemic programs through September, as part of his $1.9 trillion rescue package

A group of Republican senators, meanwhile, this week unveiled a $618 billion proposal that would maintain the $300 weekly benefit through June.

Biden has said he'd like his relief package to go through Congress with bipartisan support. However, with hopes of garnering GOP votes waning, Democratic leaders are moving to fast-track it through a procedural process called reconciliation, which would allow the deal to pass without Republican support.

The goal is to be finished and have the bill signed into law by March 14, a Senate aide told CNN.

But passing a bill that late could cause another break in payments, experts said. Lawmakers would have to act in coming weeks to give the US Department of Labor time to issue guidance and state unemployment agencies time to incorporate the new provisions in their computer systems.

""You would want them to have acted by the end of February,"" Indivar Dutta-Gupta, co-executive director of the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality, said of lawmakers. ""That's just to keep people from missing a week of checks. People also need to be able to plan their finances and plan their spending.""

Even before the pandemic, many families would have struggled to handle a week without pay. It's even tougher now for many out-of-work Americans to go without a few weeks of unemployment benefits, since many have tapped out lines of credit and loans from friends and family members.

""You are definitely going to see consequences of people missing payments if policymakers wait until mid-March to act,"" said Dutta-Gupta, who advocates tying benefit extensions to economic measures rather than calendar dates.

Those missed payments really add up, as Stettner's analysis of Department of Treasury data found. Actual unemployment payouts totaled only $28.7 billion in the first four weeks of January, which is 38% less than workers would have received if their benefits had been uninterrupted and they had received the $300 weekly supplement, he said.

Lawmakers passed their $900 billion relief package on December 21, less than a week before the pandemic unemployment payments from Congress' March relief deal were to lapse. Trump further delayed the extension by not signing the legislation until December 27.

While some states began paying the benefits soon thereafter, others took weeks, according to The Century Foundation's review of state unemployment agency websites and local news coverage.

There are still 11 states that have not confirmed they are paying Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits, and 13 that have not confirmed they are paying Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits, as of January 30, the analysis found.

Also causing delays: Some out-of-work Americans must provide additional documentation to meet new eligibility criteria contained in the December package, while others who exhausted their payments before the end of the year have to reapply and verify they are still out of work.

While the benefits are retroactive, that doesn't immediately help those who are missing payments.

""They will get the money later, but they just won't get it in January when they might have had bills due or were trying to buy food or put gas in their car,"" Stettner said."
"AstraZeneca vaccine appears to substantially reduce transmission of the coronavirus, study shows","London (CNN) The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine appears to substantially reduce transmission of the virus, rather than simply preventing symptomatic infections, UK researchers have suggested.

The rate of positive PCR tests declined by about half after two doses, according to preliminary results by researchers at the University of Oxford that have yet to be peer reviewed.

Their analysis, released as a preprint Tuesday,also supports spacing out doses and estimates good efficacy after just one shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

The study did not measure transmission directly -- for example, by tracing contacts who were infected by study volunteers. But the researchers did collect regular nasal swabs from some participants and found that the rate of positive PCR tests fell by half after two doses of the vaccine. After one dose only, the rate of positive tests fell by 67%.

""While transmission studies per se were not included in the analysis, swabs were obtained from volunteers every week in the UK study, regardless of symptoms, to allow assessment of the overall impact of the vaccine on risk of infection and thus a surrogate for potential onward transmission,"" the authors write.

If the vaccine were simply making infections milder, PCR positivity would not change, the authors argued in the preprint analysis. ""A measure of overall PCR positivity is appropriate to assess whether there is a reduction in the burden of infection.""

Coronavirus vaccine trials have primarily looked at prevention of symptomatic cases of Covid-19. Previously, there has been little other public data suggesting that vaccines could prevent people from passing the infection to others.

Speaking to the UK's Science Media Centre (SMC), Helen Fletcher, professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the data in the study ""suggest a possibility that the vaccine could have an impact on transmission but further follow-up would be needed to confirm this.""

Dr. Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, told the SMC the study ""hints that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine may be effective in stopping people being able to transmit the virus.""

He added: ""While this would be extremely welcome news, we do need more data before this can be confirmed and so it's important that we all still continue to follow social distancing guidance after we have been vaccinated.""

Salim Abdool Karim, the chair of the South African government's coronavirus advisory panel, told CNN on Wednesday that the results shared in the preprint were a ""promising start"" to understanding coronavirus transmission after vaccination but that more research is needed.

A patient receives an injection of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination center in Brighton, southern England, on January 26, 2021.

Dose spacing

The vaccine showed 66.7% efficacy against symptomatic disease starting two weeks after the second shot, researchers at the University of Oxford said.

The new analysis adds new trial sites and a month of new data to the mix, building upon earlier results announced by AstraZeneca that its vaccine had showed an estimated 70.4% efficacy.

However, the latest research also suggests the vaccine may offer substantial protection after a single shot.

The study estimates 76% efficacy up to three months following one dose. This is based on a subset of 88 symptomatic infections, split unevenly between the vaccine and placebo groups between 22 and 90 days after vaccination. The study also found relatively stable levels of antibodies during this time frame, ""with minimal waning by day 90.""

Furthermore, the authors suggest there could be higher efficacy with more spaced-out doses. Among adults age 18 to 55, vaccine efficacy appeared to rise when the time between shots was spaced out from less than six weeks to more than 12. However, more information is needed to know how statistically different that finding is.

Taken together, the findings may bolster the UK's decision to recommend spacing out doses up to 12 weeks apart, according to a statement from the chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial and co-author of the paper, Andrew Pollard.

""This is positive news as it shows that just one dose of this vaccine generates good levels of immunity and that this protection does not seem to wane in the shorter term,"" said Brown, of the British Society for Immunology.

""In immunology terms, this finding is not unexpected as we know that some other vaccines confer better immunity when the doses are more spread out. Although further information is required to confirm these findings for older age groups, overall this new research should provide reassurance around the UK's decision to offer the two doses of this vaccine 12 weeks apart.""

Professor Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, cautioned against interpreting the estimates in the study as indicative of a higher efficacy with a longer dosing gap, citing limitations with the study design.

""Most importantly, the study was not designed to look at different dosing gaps or at one versus two doses. This means that participants weren't randomised and it is therefore quite possible that there are other things that are driving this apparent trend with dosing schedule,"" she told the SMC.

""The only way in which this question can be answered robustly is in a prospective trial with different dosing schedules compared side-by-side.""

'Inevitable uncertainty'

Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the extra data in the paper were helpful but that some ""inevitable uncertainty"" around exact efficacy values remained.

""The data definitely provide some evidence to suggest that the eventual protection from two doses of this vaccine are not worsened by having a longer than 28 or 42 day period between doses and tend to confirm what had been shown before, that if anything the eventual efficacy was better,"" he said. ""The data also do not provide any evidence that efficacy wanes after the first dose.""

Similar data is not yet available on delaying the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to 12 weeks after the first dose, said Dr. Gillies O'Bryan-Tear, past chair of policy and communications at the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine in comments to the SMC. But, he added, ""most commentators agree that it is likely to be the same with that vaccine, and indeed, other two dose vaccines.""

The authors caveat that the trials were not initially designed to evaluate efficacy by dose intervals, but the data ""arose due to the logistics of running large-scale clinical trials in a pandemic setting.""

The primary analysis is based on 332 symptomatic infections that occurred among more than 17,000 trial volunteers in the UK, Brazil and South Africa more than two weeks after their second dose.

AstraZeneca announced last month it had completed enrollment in its Phase 3 trial in the United States, which will serve as ""the primary basis"" for the company's eventual application to the US Food and Drug Administration.

The vaccine has already been authorized in a number countries, such as the UK and India, but authorization may not come in the US until late March at the earliest, according to Operation Warp Speed's Moncef Slaoui."
I've had my Covid-19 vaccine -- now what can I safely do?,"(CNN) The day has finally come. You've received the second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine currently on the Western market -- Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca.

Does that mean you're free to go about life as you did before the pandemic once immunity kicks in?

Sorry, there is no immunity passport yet, experts told CNN. There are still safety precautions you need to follow in order to keep you, your loved ones and everyone else safe and protected from the deadly coronavirus.

Read on for answers from the experts on top questions such as when can you stop wearing a mask, eat inside a restaurant, travel, go to sporting events and concerts, and freely visit friends and family.

Can I please stop wearing a face mask?

Let's ""face"" it: The answer is no.

Try to think of a face mask as your new best friend, one that you plan to cherish and appreciate for a good, long time. Here are five reasons why.

1) It's not 100% protection. Even the best of the currently available vaccines only offer up to 95% protection when you are fully immunized. That means there is a 5% chance you can catch the novel coronavirus at any time.

Think that sounds small? Let's compare that risk to birth control : Pills, patches, vaginal rings and shots are 91% to 96% effective. Yet that translates to nine women becoming pregnant for every 100 women on each of those forms of birth control, according to the US Food and Drug Administration

2) Everyone's different. Some people are going to mount more robust immune responses to both rounds of the Covid-19 vaccination than others. That's one of the key reasons experts are insisting everyone receive the second shot of the vaccine within a key time frame.

""In looking at the Phase 1, Phase 2 data, what I saw with a single dose is some people had high levels of virus-neutralizing antibody, others were nonresponders,"" said vaccine scientist Dr. Peter Hotez, professor and dean at the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, in a prior interview

""So the major reason for the second dose is to get everybody to respond. If you just get a single dose, you don't really know where you stand,"" Hotez said.

Remember, it can take two to three weeks after you get the second shot before your immunity fully kicks in.

3) A moving target. As is typical with viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mutating around the world -- creating variants that are proving to be more contagious than those the US is currently battling.

Experts are already warning that antibodies from a prior case of Covid-19 won't protect against being reinfected with a variant from South Africa.

""If it becomes dominant, the experience of our colleagues in South Africa indicate that even if you've been infected with the original virus that there is a very high rate of reinfection,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday. ""Previous infection does not seem to protect you against reinfection.""

There is also a possibility that the current vaccines won't fully protect against the new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. That's being studied feverishly right now, so stay tuned.

4) You could be a silent spreader. Remember Remember ""Typhoid Mary"" Mallon ? She was an Irish immigrant who worked as a cook for New York families and refused to believe she was an asymptomatic conduit for typhoid fever because she remained healthy. Refusing to cooperate with authorities, Mallon contaminated at least 122 people in the 1880s, leaving five dead, before she was caught and quarantined twice for a total of 26 years.

That scenario could apply to Covid-19.

""We don't yet know whether being vaccinated means that you're no longer a carrier of coronavirus. That is, fully immunized people may still be able to spread Covid-19 to others,"" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.

""It's possible that someone could get the vaccine but could still be an asymptomatic carrier,"" Wen said in a Q&A for CNN . ""They may not show symptoms, but they have the virus in their nasal passageway so that if they're speaking, breathing, sneezing and so on, they can still transmit it to others.""

5) Will immunity last? Researchers don't yet know just how long the immunity given by the current vaccines -- such as it is -- will last. There is a possibility that booster doses may be needed in the months or years to come. That's not uncommon -- adults need tetanus and diphtheria boosters every 10 years.

So until more is known about how long the protection lasts -- and against which variants -- stay safe and protect others by wearing a mask.

When can I hang out with friends and family?

That depends on everyone's vaccine status, experts say. If friends or other members of your family have also received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, the risk is greatly reduced, especially if the visit is outdoors.

""It's probably pretty safe to see others who were also vaccinated, after everyone gets both doses and waits a few weeks,"" Wen said.

It would also be safe if the unvaccinated friends or family members or friends quarantined for 10 days before the outdoor get-together.

However, if the visit is indoors, ""there is going to be some level of risk,"" Wen said, especially with the current spread of more contagious variants and the less than 100% efficacy of today's vaccines.

""That risk will be much lower than if you were not vaccinated, but the risk is still going to be there to you, and you could still be a risk to the unvaccinated members of your family, as you could be an asymptomatic carrier who transmits to them,"" Wen said.

""If you really want to spend time with the grandkids indoors, the safest way to do this is still for everyone to quarantine for at least 10 days and lower their risk during these 10 days,"" Wen said. ""Quarantining for seven days and a negative test is an option too, but everyone also has to do the quarantine — a negative test alone is not enough.""

And again, just because you've been vaccinated, that doesn't reduce your responsibility. You should continue to wear a mask and practice social distancing whenever you are around others.

""You wouldn't want to engage in activities where you could potentially acquire the novel coronavirus and then transmit it to others,"" Wen said.

""That includes seeing other people who are vaccinated, but not wearing a mask — based on what we know now, they could have the virus and pass it onto you, and you could pass it onto the people you live with. An abundance of caution is still a good idea.""

When can I eat at an indoor restaurant or go to a concert or sporting event?

Indoor restaurants are likely hotspots for Covid-19 transmission. That's partly because no one is wearing a mask while they eat, thus spreading their respiratory droplets around as they socialize.

The other reason? Most restaurants do not have HEPA filters or other filtration equipment on their circulation systems, leaving the air poorly ventilated and a prime breeding ground for virus spread. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends avoiding ""poorly ventilated spaces.""

So even with a second vaccine, you're still taking a chance that you might be exposed to Covid-19 and become a silent spreader.

But won't the typical 6-foot spread between tables or booth partitions do the trick?

""I think the 6 feet indoors is not enough by itself,"" said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, who has been studying Covid-19 transmission.

""You have to have good ventilation in that bar or restaurant,"" said Marr, the co-author of a paper on airborne transmission of Covid-19 via very small droplets called aerosols.

However, even a HEPA filter wouldn't make environmental engineer Marr feel comfortable eating inside a restaurant. In order for the filter to protect you, the virus-laden air would have to pass through the air handling system and be filtered first before it gets to you, she said.

""HEPA filters reduce the amount of virus in the background air, but most transmission takes place in these close contact type of scenarios where you're near someone that's infected and they're spreading lots of virus. The HEPA filter doesn't help with that,"" she said.

""And since I can't wear a mask while I'm eating, I'm just avoiding indoor restaurants until this is over,"" Marr said.

What about fun things to do, such as concerts and sporting events?

""Once vaccinated, an outdoor sporting event or concert is probably safe, if there is good social distancing between households and everyone is wearing masks,"" Wen said. ""Indoor, crowded gatherings are probably still best to avoid even if you're vaccinated.""

Can I travel if I've been vaccinated?

""I want to emphasize that now is not the time to be traveling period, internationally or domestically, it's just not a good time to be traveling,"" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's new director, in a CNN global town hall last week

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

And that applies to people who have already been vaccinated, added Fauci, the White House chief medical adviser.

""Getting vaccinated does not say now I have a free pass to travel,"" Fauci said at the CNN global town hall. ""Nor does it say that I have a free pass to put aside all of the public health measures that we talk about all the time.""

""I mean, if you absolutely have to travel and it's essential, then obviously, one would have to do that. But we don't want people to think because they got vaccinated, then other public health recommendations just don't apply,"" Fauci said."
There are no Black execs at the top of Britain's biggest companies,"London (CNN Business) The number of Black executives at the very top of the biggest companies on the London Stock Exchange has fallen to zero.

FTSE 100 UKX There are no Black CEOs, CFOs or chairs in theindex for the first time in six years, according to a study published on Wednesday by Green Park, an executive recruitment and diversity consultancy agency.

No progress has been made on diversity since Green Park began researching the issue. Only 10 of 297 people in the three top leadership positions do not identify as White, the same proportion as in 2014, the research found.

""The snowy peaks of British business remain stubbornly white,"" Trevor Phillips, the chair of Green Park, said in a statement. ""We know there is no shortage of qualified candidates to fill these roles if companies are willing to look,"" he added.

UK companies have faced growing pressure to tackle racial injustice in their own ranks in the wake of the killing of George Floyd last June, which sparked Black Lives Matter protests across the United States, Britain and elsewhere.

Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi detained for 2 weeks under import-export laws following coup,"(CNN) Myanmar's deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained for two weeks, according to her party's spokesperson, two days after the country's powerful armed forces seized control in a coup.

Suu Kyi, who was the country's de facto leader under the title state counsellor, was issued with an arrest warrant for breaching the country's import and export laws.

National League for Democracy (NLD) spokesperson Kyi Toe, posted on his Facebook account Wednesday that Suu Kyi would be detained until February 15.

""According to reliable information, a 14-day arrest warrant was issued against Daw Aung San Su Kyi under the Import and Export Law,"" he said.

Deposed President Win Myint was also detained under the country's Disaster Management Law, Kyi Toe said. Neither he nor Suu Kyi has been charged.

Suu Kyi and former President Win Myint were arrested in pre-dawn raids Monday hours before the military declared that power had been handed to commander in chief Min Aung Hlaing over unfounded allegations of election fraud. A state of emergency was declared for one year.

Numerous senior lawmakers and officials in the ruling National League for Democracy Party (NLD) were also detained, with some 400 kept at a guest house in the capital.

Cementing its rule, the new ruling junta removed 24 ministers and deputies from government and named 11 of its own allies as replacements who will assume their roles in a new administration.

The sudden seizure of power came as the new parliament was due to open and after months of increasing friction between the civilian government and the powerful military, known as the Tatmadaw, over alleged election irregularities.

Suu Kyi's party, the NLD claimed an overwhelming victory in the November 2020 elections, only the second since the end of military rule, taking 83% of the vote, which granted it another five years in government.

The country's election commission has repeatedly denied mass voter fraud took place.

Analysts have suggested the coup was more likely to do with the military attempting to reassert its power and the personal ambition of army chief Min Aung Hlaing, who was set to step down this year, rather than serious claims of voter fraud.

""Facing mandatory retirement in a few months, with no route to a civilian leadership role, and amid global calls for him to face criminal charges in The Hague, he was cornered,"" Jared Genser, an international human rights lawyer who previously served as pro bono counsel to Suu Kyi, said in a CNN op-ed

On Tuesday, United States President Joe Biden formally determined that the military takeover in Myanmar constituted a coup, a designation that requires the US to cut its foreign assistance to the country. A State Department official, speaking on a call with reporters, also said that sanctions in response to the power grab remain on the table.

Following the coup, doctors from hospitals across the country prepared to strike in protest, despite the coronavirus pandemic.

Assistant Doctors at Yangon General Hospital released a statement pledging their participation in the ""civil disobedience movement,"" saying they will not work under a military led government and called for Suu Kyi's release.

Video showed medical workers in Yangon outside the hospital Wednesday dressed in their scrubs and protective gear, while wearing red ribbons.

Myanmar's Ministry of Information warned the media and public Tuesday not to spread rumors on social media or incite unrest, urging people to cooperate with the government following Monday's coup.

""Some media and public are spreading rumors on social media conducting gatherings to incite rowdiness and issuing statements which can cause unrest,"" the statement read. ""We would like to urge the public not to carry out these acts and would like to notify the public to cooperate with the government in accordance with the existing laws.""

Anxiety is growing in Myanmar as to what will come next and many in the country have urged the international community to step up government pressure.

For more than 50 years, Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was run by successive isolationist military regimes that plunged the country into poverty and brutally stifled any dissent. Thousands of critics, activists, journalists, academics and artists were routinely jailed and tortured during that time.

Suu Kyi shot to prominence during her decades-long struggle against military rule. When her party, the NLD, won a landslide in elections in 2015 and formed the first civilian government, many pro-democracy supporters hoped it would mark a break from the military rule of the past and offer hope that Myanmar would continue to reform.

""We know that the military cannot be trusted to respect the human rights of people and the rule of law in Burma,"" said Bo Kyi, co-founder of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. ""When the military was last in charge, political prisoners like me were rounded up, sent to prison for decades, (put in) solitary confinement and tortured. We are concerned that if this state of emergency is not reversed, similar things will happen again,"" added Kyi, who is also a former political prisoner.

""There is a fear that the military could continue persecuting officials, activists and crack down on ordinary people. But we have hope that Burma can return on its democratic path."""
FBI raids homes of 2 men who held rally on eve of Capitol attack,"Washington (CNN) The FBI recently raided the homes of two men who sponsored an invective-laced rally near the US Capitol a day before the deadly insurrection, the first known search warrants involving people who organized and spoke at rallies preceding the attack.

CNN learned of the raids through an eyewitness account, public records, a lawyer representing one of the rally organizers and an FBI spokeswoman who confirmed details of the searches.

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller confirmed that federal agents executed search warrants last week at two properties in Orange County, California, which public records indicate belong to Russell Taylor and Alan Hostetter. The two men run the American Phoenix Project, which co-sponsored a pro- Donald Trump rally near the Supreme Court on January 5, one day before the attack.

Neither man has been charged with any crimes.

Court documents related to the search warrants are still under seal, but the raids are the first publicly known federal actions against people who organized rallies linked to the Capitol attack. Federal investigators have issued more than 500 subpoenas and search warrants in the probe.

A key question about the fledgling investigation has been how aggressively prosecutors will scrutinize the people who organized and spoke at rallies that preceded the stunning assault.

Search warrants

Taylor and Hostetter are well-documented promoters of conspiracy theories ranging from QAnon and the ""deep state"" to those related to the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election.

An FBI spokesperson told CNN the search was conducted at the property Taylor owns at 6 a.m. Wednesday. CNN obtained photos and videos of FBI agents at his house hours later.

Spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment further about the raids or what investigators were searching for, noting that the case files are still sealed.

A lawyer for Taylor, Dyke Huish, told CNN that the agents were ""just gathering information on people that were at or near the Capitol building on the day in question,"" referring to January 6. Huish said Taylor ""cooperated with investigators"" and the search was finished ""without incident."" Eimiller, the FBI spokeswoman, said ""no arrests were made"" during the searches.

Taylor acknowledged the raid on his Orange County home in a Telegram post on Friday. Using a pseudonym, Taylor urged his followers to ""hold the line,"" adding, ""I am working with a lawyer and per his recommendation he said to keep on the down low for a bit to stay off any radars.""

Hostetter didn't respond to multiple requests for comment about the raid or his DC rally.

The founder of the group that co-sponsored the rally, Virginia Women for Trump, told CNN that she hasn't been interviewed by the FBI. An employee at Women for America First, a separate organization that held the rally near the White House with Trump one day later, told CNN that nobody at the organization had been interviewed by the FBI either.

Violent rhetoric

Through their right-wing organization , Taylor and Hostetter secured speaking slots at the rally, and used their speeches to spew violent, battle-ready rhetoric.

Weeks earlier, they reached out to Virginia Women for Trump, which was planning an event at the Supreme Court on January 5, one day before Congress would tally the electoral votes and put the final nail in the coffin of Trump's effort to overturn his loss.

Alice Butler-Short, founder of Virginia Women for Trump, said she primarily organized the rally and invited the speakers, but Taylor and Hostetter helped pay for the logistics and security.

""They kind of found me on Facebook,"" Butler-Short said in an interview with CNN.

The lineup of speakers also included the far-right conspiracy theorist Ali Alexander , who ran a ""Stop the Steal"" group, and Trump ally Roger Stone, who supports the Proud Boys extremist group. They pushed the debunked conspiracy theory that the election was stolen from Trump. Though Stone said, ""We renounce violence,"" Hostetter ratcheted things up is his speech.

""We are at war in this country,"" Hostetter said. ""We are at war tomorrow.""

He continued, ""Our voices tomorrow are going to put the fear of God in the cowards and the traitors, the (Republicans in name only), the communists of the Democrat Party, they need to know we as a people, a hundred million strong, are coming for them If they do the wrong thing.""

""I will see you all tomorrow at the frontlines,"" Hostetter said as he ended the speech. ""We are taking our country back.""

Taylor expressed support for QAnon in his speech and issued a call-to-arms, saying, ""In these streets we will fight, and we will bleed before we allow our freedom to be taken from us."" (Huish, his attorney, later claimed he was speaking metaphorically and ""has never called for violence."")

The frontlines

Taylor's lawyer tried to distance his client from the mob that invaded the Capitol, saying Taylor was ""outside"" but ""never entered the building nor did he cause any damage to the building.""

""His sole purpose in going to Washington DC was to participate in a peaceful and patriotic protest in those things that he believes to be true and correct,"" Huish told CNN in a statement.

In a since-deleted Instagram video from January 6, Hostetter said he was avoiding the Ellipse because he had ""gear"" that wouldn't be allowed in. In another video obtained by CNN, Taylor said he was walking towards the Capitol and said he was just informed that rioters had breached barricades near the building. He is wearing a flak jacket with what looks like a knife sticking out.

""We'll see if the Capitol Police are oath keepers of the Constitution,"" Taylor is heard saying.

Photos from Hostetter's Instagram and photojournalists place him and Taylor just outside the Capitol building during the riot. An AFP photographer snapped an image of Taylor giving police the finger around 4:30 p.m. near the North side of the Capitol, near the entrance to the Senate.

Two other photos show Taylor near a police line on the North side of the Capitol. One photo shows him using his body to push against a police line; the other shows him near a police line with what appears to be a gas mask.

He later wrote on Facebook that he never made it inside."
British scientists say the next dangerous Covid variant is likely already out there. We just don't know it yet,"Cambridge, England (CNN) Almost a month into a third nationwide lockdown , most of England seems to be in hibernation: stores are shuttered, high streets are deserted, and trains are almost empty. But in one small village in the countryside near Cambridge, in eastern England, there is a hive of activity.

Dressed in white lab coats and surgical masks, staff here scurry from machine to machine -- robots and giant computers that are so heavy, they're placed on solid steel plates to support their weight.

The staff at the Sanger Institute are much more than essential workers -- right now, they're doing some of the most important work on Earth: genetically sequencing the coronavirus. Internally, it's called ""Project Heron.""

The labor-intensive project, involving hundreds of people, is being done just down the road from the Cambridge pub that Francis Crick walked into in 1953 to declare he'd ""found the secret of life"" -- the structure of DNA. Today that discovery is allowing scientists to spot dangerous mutations in the genetic code of coronavirus that could make t he pandemic much worse than it already is.

Industrial-scale sequencing

Every day, vans arrive at the Sanger Institute carrying crates full of virus samples from around the UK. The green crates are loaded into an industrial-sized walk-in freezer, set up in the parking lot.

By this point, there are no more cotton swabs. The samples -- both positive and negative -- are in a solution of what's left over after initial testing. The scientists don't need much.

Inside the lab, a robot is programmed to pluck only the positive samples from a small, plastic muffin tin-like plate and consolidate them onto a separate tray which is sealed by hand. Hundreds of samples end up consolidated into a single vial. In another lab, chemicals are added, and shaken by a small machine, then pressed thin between two pieces of glass. The glass plate is put into one of the giant sequencers, a loudly humming machine that looks like a high-tech photocopier.

One of the temporary freezers that have been hurriedly set up in the parking lot of the Sanger Institute to store the thousands of Covid-19 test samples that make it here from across the UK every week.

Fifteen hours later, the computer spits out so much genetic data that entire server farms have been built off-site to house it. From start to finish, the process takes about five days. Around 10,000 samples are sequenced each week in this lab alone -- around a quarter of the total number sequenced globally.

Then comes the hard part: Combing through all that data.

""We're looking for mutations that may allow the virus to either be more transmissible or to cause more severe disease, and particularly now that vaccines are beginning to be rolled out globally, we're looking potentially for mutations that we think might affect the ability of the vaccines to protect people,"" said Ewan Harrison, a microbiologist who is helping coordinate the network of scientists working on the Covid-19 genomics operation in the UK.

A scientist at the Sanger Institute prepares the Covid-19 samples for sequencing. More than 700 positive samples are sequenced in a single run of one machine, which takes around five days.

Harrison explains that if you sequence enough of the population you can see how the virus has moved through the community and where there have been groups of infections -- including super-spreader events. ""That's really powerful ... that's really at the heart of what viral sequencing is for,"" he said.

Harrison has played a leading role in the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK) a team of hundreds of scientists at universities and labs across the country that sprang up at the start of the pandemic, working in unison to create and make sense of the genetic data being sequenced.

Finding the UK variant

Less than two months ago, that network of scientists and Britain's growing mountain of genetic data helped to identify and trace the spread of the variant that has now become dominant in the UK. It was first spotted in Kent, a rural county that also has some of the most deprived communities in southeast England.

""People in Kent weren't all having house parties and going to the same supermarket,"" Public Health England spokesperson Ruairidh Villar told CNN. His scientist colleagues quickly ruled out bad behavior.

And yet, daily case counts continued to climb across the county, even while they were falling in most other parts of the UK, which was under national lockdown.

They found the culprit in the UK's genomic database, which at the time covered about one in every 10 positive Covid-19 samples in the country.

The rogue strain of the virus, called B.1.1.7, had been circulating in Kent since at least September. It spreads 30-70% more easily than the original virus, according to Britain's chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance

It didn't take long for B.1.1.7 to be detected in the capital, and throughout the country. It has now been spotted in at least 70 countries, and most US states. The CDC says it could become the dominant strain of coronavirus in the US by March.

Cambridge University Professor Ravi Gupta said that, based on how quickly it spread in the UK, ""It's probable that the same thing will happen in the US.""

Inside his lab, Gupta showed CNN a ""phylogenetic family tree"" -- the equivalent of ancestry.com for Covid-19. On this tree, B.1.1.7 looks like a second cousin, twice removed, from the original coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The genetic difference is 23 mutations, but the real oddity is that B.1.1.7 has so few close ""relatives.""

""We found very few -- virtually no sequences that are highly related to the B.1.1.7 variant. In other words, it popped out of nowhere,"" said Gupta.

Professor Ravindra Gupta, along with colleagues at the University of Cambridge, was one of the first to spot the UK Covid variant.

Scientists are unlikely to ever find ""patient zero"" of the new variant, but they have a theory.

Last year Gupta was studying a Covid-19 patient with a compromised immune system who couldn't shake the virus for more than three months. Inside a body that couldn't fight back, the virus had time to mutate much quicker than it would being passed from person to person in the population.

Gupta compared the virus of his patient, who eventually died, to the sequencing database and found that there was a virus already circulating that shared one key mutation with his patient: B.1.1.7.

""It was really striking to see,"" he said. The patient didn't have B.1.1.7, but the volume of mutations within their body illustrated for Gupta that it's ""very, very likely"" that if there was a B.1.1.7 ""patient zero"" they were an immunocompromised person. Harrison thinks so too.

Vaccines for a changing virus

Gupta's pre-published lab research indicates the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is still effective in beating the UK variant after one dose, though slightly less so in blood taken from patients aged over 80. Other studies on different vaccines have shown similar results. But the same may not be true for every variant that comes along.

There are already concerns about decreased vaccine effectiveness on the South African variant, prompting vaccine makers like Pfizer and Moderna to start working on booster shots to keep up with a changing virus.

Just this week, Public Health England said a small sample of B.1.1.7 cases from the UK have been found to contain a new mutation also present in the South African variant. Early lab research suggests the so-called ""escape mutant"" may help the virus evade antibodies produced by vaccines -- potentially making them less effective.

Gupta thinks the concern over these variants is well deserved. ""These viruses are already on their way to becoming more resistant to the immune system and to vaccines,"" he said.

The UK variant, like others, has changes on the so-called ""spike protein,"" the part of the virus that helps it invade a human cell. Scientists think this could be why it's more transmissible than earlier strains and also causes worries for the vaccine, as those currently developed work using the spike protein.

Before vaccines can be adapted to the changing virus, samples need to be sequenced. The Sanger Institute, together with 16 smaller British labs, account for around half the world's total sequencing effort. Many countries don't have the ability to sequence any Covid-19 samples at all.

""We talk about the UK variant and South African variant and Brazil variant -- but the irony is it's probably just that these are the countries that have advanced sequencing capacity and [the variants] may well have emerged elsewhere but we simply won't know it. And there may be others,"" said Villar.

Rows of sequencers at the Sanger Institute. Each machine costs around £1 million (around $1.37 million) and has to be placed on a reinforced metal plate as they are so heavy.

Gupta and Harrison believe it's likely that there are already dangerous variants of the virus spreading in countries where scientists won't be able to spot new variants as they arise.

""These immunocompromised individuals are scattered around the world,"" said Gupta. ""So, it is very likely there are undetected variants out there.""

The British government has announced plans to expand its sequencing work to countries that can't do their own. The exact details are still being ironed out.

""It's trying to find those countries that don't have the capacity to sequence themselves, [or have] very low capacity, to improve our global awareness of mutations that could have absolutely devastating public health impacts,"" said Villar. ""Obviously that brings incredible benefits globally but also protects the UK from variants that may endanger the public here too.""

Villar says he is sure that the Sanger Institute will be involved in the effort and that the British government is planning a ""significant increase in the capacity of both sequencing and analysis"" to help in the global fight against Covid-19.

Dr. Ewan Harrison co-ordinates COG-UK, a consortium of scientists which sprang up in March 2020 to form the world's biggest Covid genome sequencing operation.

Harrison isn't sure exactly what his role will be, or when he'll go back to his old job. A year ago, he was studying why people are colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) -- a dangerous, antibiotic resistant strain of bacteria -- before being diverted to ""Project Heron.""

Others were sequencing human genomes, plants, parasites or cancer cells. All of that has been put on hold for something much more urgent.

""It's been a long, long year,"" he said. ""But you know, I think that we're all very proud of what we've achieved in terms of the genomics program."""
Three skiers are missing after getting caught in a large avalanche in Colorado,"(CNN) Three skiers are missing after getting caught in a large avalanche between the Colorado towns of Silverton and Ophir, according to a preliminary report from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.

The three belonged to a larger group of back-country skiers who were traveling Monday and triggered the avalanche in an area locally known as ""The Nose.""

Four people were caught in the avalanche and fully buried in debris, the report said. One of the skiers was found and had sustained minor injuries, the report added.

Search-and-rescue operations for the other three were suspended Tuesday night due to the threat of another avalanche in the area, according to the information center (CAIC).

The San Juan County Office of Emergency Management says the recovery mission for three missing skiers was suspended due to 'considerable' avalanche danger

Even though the recovery mission has been temporarily suspended, the identities of the three skiers is ""still pending per San Juan County Coroner's Office investigation,"" the San Juan County Office of Emergency Management wrote in a post on Facebook.

Biden looks to be in 'lockstep' with allies on China,"Washington (CNN) The Biden administration wants to be ""in lockstep"" with allies and partners and then will engage with China, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Tuesday.

Price said it was ""no coincidence"" that President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken's initial interactions were with partners in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region, noting that ""we see our alliances, our partnerships globally as again this force multiplier across a wide range of challenges, and that includes in our relationship with Beijing.""

Relations between Washington and Beijing during the previous Trump administration were oftentimes fractious, with clashes on issues relating to trade, technology, regional security and human rights.

Price described the US' current relationship with Beijing as one viewed ""through the lens of competition and positioning ourselves to compete and ultimately to out-compete with the Chinese.""

"There's no need to delay second dose of Covid-19 vaccine so more can get the first, Fauci says","(CNN) Delaying second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine so that as many Americans as possible can get the first dose is ""not necessarily"" what Dr. Anthony Fauci recommends, he said Wednesday.

Fauci told ABC's George Stephanopoulos it looks like there will be a much steadier supply of vaccines coming in through February and into March.

""Certainly you don't want vaccines sitting around in the refrigerator or in a freezer if they're ready to go. You want to give them to people,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Fauci added he believes there is a way to accelerate vaccine distribution without delaying a second dose.

""If you miss it by a few days to a week or two, I don't think that's a big problem, as the CDC says, but I'd be concerned about delaying it for three months or so,"" he said.

""You got to be careful because you're dealing with different vaccine platforms,"" he said, adding that the data that is available for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines ""are solid"" about getting a second shot 28 days and 21 days later, respectively.

About 70% to 85% of the US population should be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 before the country can begin to return to a sense of normalcy, Fauci told CNN on Tuesday night.

So far, less than 2% of Americans have received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Across the US, nearly 34 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered, with more than 27 million people having received at least one dose -- or just over 8% of the population. About 6.4 million people have received both doses, the CDC data shows.

Fauci said he's hopeful the country can get to that high level of vaccinations by the end of the summer to the beginning of fall.

""Having said that,"" he added, ""there is an absolute 'but' in that. And the 'but' is that we have to address the variants.""

Experts have sounded the alarm about the new Covid-19 variants that have been detected in the US, warning the country is now in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible before the variants spread too far and possibly trigger another surge of infections.

States begin to identify deaths believed linked to UK variant

Health officials in three states -- New Jersey, California and Alabama -- have begun to identify deaths believed to be linked to the variant first identified in the UK. While the B.1.1.7 variant may be more transmissible, it is not known to be more deadly or cause more severe disease.

Seeing deaths caused by the new variants would be no surprise -- there's no evidence they are more deadly than than older variants of the virus, but there is also no evidence they are any less deadly, and more than 3,000 people are dying from Covid-19 every day in the US.

The University of Alabama Birmingham Hospital told CNN on Wednesday that a man identified as Alfonzia Jackson died February 2 from myocarditis and cardiogenic shock after he contracted the B.1.1.7 variant.

Jackson's wife, Ashley, told CNN it was ""very scary"" when doctors said her husband was infected with a new variant of the virus.

""My first thought was, how, when did he get that? Where? And then also, how many others have that same variant that are unaware?"" she told CNN's Brianna Keilar.

On January 27, New Jersey Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said at a news conference that one person who had died had the coronavirus variant. The patient, who was not identified, had underlying health conditions.

Health officials in San Diego County announced January 28 a ""probable"" variant case in a 71-year-old man who had died.

Dr. Eric McDonald, San Diego County's medical director of epidemiology, told reporters ""this is a household contact of a confirmed case, who unfortunately, we didn't have that sample available to prove that it was whole genome sequence B.1.1.7.

""But because there is an intimate member of the household who did have that variant, and that individual was pretty much exposed to that 71-year-old, we are confident in assigning that as a probable case,"" McDonald added.

The US has been averaging more than 140,000 new coronavirus cases and more than 3,000 reported deaths per day lately, but very few Covid-19 tests are sequenced to find out whether the virus is a variant.

The limited amount of sequencing has found more than 500 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant in 33 states, according to the CDC.

Study: Younger adults are biggest spreaders of virus in US

A group of researchers reported Tuesday that the biggest spreaders of Covid-19 in the US are adults aged 20 to 49 -- and efforts to control the spread, including vaccinations, should probably focus on that age group.

The team of researchers at Imperial College London used cell phone location data covering more than 10 million people and publicly available information on the spread of the virus to calculate which age groups were most responsible for the spread of the virus across most of the United States.

They estimated that people 35 to 49 accounted for 41% of the new transmissions through mid-August, and adults 20 to 34 were responsible for another 35%. Children and teens accounted for just 6% of spread while people 50 to 64 made up 15% of transmission.

Experts have previously warned that the surges were largely driven by younger groups, Fauci said, but that doesn't mean those groups should get the vaccine ""at the expense of getting the older people who have the underlying conditions, get vaccinated.""

""You don't want to deprive them to get the younger ones, because they're the ones that are going to wind up in the hospital and have a higher rate of death,"" Fauci said.

Teachers don't need vaccines for schools to reopen, study says

A growing number of studies show that students should be able to go back to school safely, even if all teachers have not been vaccinated against Covid-19, according to CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.

""There is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen,"" Walensky said at a White House news briefing Wednesday. ""Vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite for safe reopening of schools.""

The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has put teachers in the 1B priority category for vaccination, along with other essential workers, but not all states are vaccinating this group. Walensky said it is important for states to make the decisions on which groups get vaccinated when, depending on supply and local circumstances.

Saturday, Walensky said on NBC's ""Today"" that in most states, if not all states, teachers should be eligible for vaccination now or in the near future.

States will see an increase in vaccine supply

Hoping to slow the pandemic as soon as possible, states have been pushing for more supply and ramping up their capabilities to get more shots into arms faster.

As of Wednesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had provided more than $1.7 billion to 27 states, localities, tribes and territories to aid the vaccination effort, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said.

FEMA has assigned more than 600 staff to the effort -- with more than half of that staff deployed directly to the vaccination sites across the country.

In West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice announced Wednesday the state has now vaccinated all teachers and school staff older than 50 who wanted the Covid-19 vaccine. West Virginia began inoculating teachers and staff January 5.

""As soon as we get an ample supply of vaccines, we'll double back through and get all the people that are under 50,"" Justice said.

The Biden administration said Wednesday the federal government will partner with California to launch two new vaccination centers in hard-hit communities.

One center will be in East Oakland and another on the east side of Los Angeles. Both are predominantly Latino communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

The administration said it has increased vaccine supply to states, tribes and territories by more than 20%, including more than 1.3 million shots per day between January 27 and Tuesday.

Despite efforts to administer more vaccine doses to communities, a new national poll from Monmouth University found 24% of respondents said it is likely they will never get the vaccine if they can avoid it.

""Reluctance to get the vaccine is driven more by partisanship than any single demographic factor,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute. ""It says a lot about the depth of our partisanship divide that it could impact public health like this.""

Among Republicans polled, 42% said they will avoid getting the vaccine if they can, while 25% of Independents and 10% of Democrats also plan to avoid the vaccine if possible.

The poll also looked at race as a factor for vaccine hesitancy and found no racial difference in vaccine reluctance among Republicans, but it did find one among Democrats. The poll found that 79% of White Democrats versus 62% of Democrats of color have either received the vaccine or want to get it as soon as possible."
First came Covid lockdown. Now a bushfire is forcing these Australians to evacuate,"(CNN) The state of Western Australia is facing an ""unprecedented situation"" as it battles a raging wildfire while millions of residents are under coronavirus lockdown, the state's premier Mark McGowan said in a media briefing Wednesday .

The Perth metropolitan area and the Peel and South West regions of Western Australia went into a five-day lockdown Sunday after a single Covid-19 case was identified in a hotel security guard at a quarantine facility in the city. The lockdown is set to lift Friday evening

But the potential threat of a Covid-19 outbreak has been superseded by a more imminent danger -- a bushfire raging near the town of Wooroloo on Perth's outskirts.

""The most important thing is preservation of life and so if you're quarantining and you're required to evacuate, you should just evacuate,"" Western Australia's Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) Commissioner Darren Klemm said in a media briefing Wednesday . ""That evacuation overrides any quarantining requirements that people might have.""

The blaze has already destroyed at least 71 homes, he said, adding that there were no reports of any deaths due to the fire. The number of burned-out homes is expected to rise, McGowan said.

""Western Australia is currently in the midst of an unprecedented situation, we're fighting disasters on two fronts,"" McGowan said.

A helicopter drops fire retardant on a fire near Wooroloo, northeast of Perth, Australia, on February 2, 2021.

Klemm said it was important that people didn't become complacent and kept abreast of updates, adding: ""It will continue to be a challenging fire for us for at least the next three, four, or five days.""

As of Tuesday evening, more than 8,000 hectares (nearly 20,000 acres) had been burned and hundreds of firefighters were involved in controlling the fire, according to DFES. The department said the cause of the ""out-of-control"" blaze is unknown.

Three evacuation centers have been set up, and DFES said it was ""humbled"" by the number of people wishing to help members of the community impacted by the bushfire.

Lockdown in Western Australia

More than 2 million people are affected by Western Australia's ""full lockdown,"" with residents only able to leave their homes for essential shopping, medical needs, exercise, and for jobs that cannot be done at home or remotely.

Schools, most businesses, entertainment venues and places of worship are all closed, and restaurants restricted to takeaway only.

With a population of around 2.76 million, Western Australia has recorded 904 coronavirus infections since the pandemic began, though it currently only has nine active cases, according to the state's health department . More than 800 of the state's confirmed cases are among international travelers and people who arrived by cruise ship or other vessel.

Australia has recorded more than 28,000 Covid-19 cases, with 909 fatalities, the majority of which occurred in the southeastern states of Victoria and New South Wales. The country has shown success in controlling the virus through stringent lockdowns and tight border controls, with all international visitors required to undergo testing and quarantine.

Other parts of Australia have also gone into lockdown over relatively few cases.

Last year, South Australia ordered a six-day shutdown after reporting 22 Covid cases , although those restrictions were lifted early after officials found a pizza bar worker had lied to the contact-tracing team, making authorities initially believe the person had caught coronavirus after a very short exposure"
Several people were injured after a small explosion sparked a fire north of Los Angeles,"(CNN) Several people were injured Tuesday after a small explosion near a filming site in the hills north of Los Angeles sparked a fire, officials said.

Three people sustained critical burn injuries and were transported to a local hospital, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman and Battalion Chief Roland Sprewell told CNN. One other person reportedly made their own way to the hospital, Sprewell added.

An initial call to 911 came in on Tuesday around 4:45 p.m. local time, Los Angeles County Fire Department Inspector Henry Narvaez told CNN.

The incident occurred in what was described as an industrial center or parking lot in Santa Clarita, where several semi-trailers had been parked, Sprewell said.

Movies are often filmed at the site, but there were none filming at the time of the explosion, Narvaez said.

Trump powers GOP schism over Greene and Cheney,"(CNN) The Republican civil war hits a critical moment on Wednesday over the fate of two prominent lawmakers who represent rival visions for a party torn by the toxic but still powerful influence of Donald Trump .

Real-time reckonings for third-ranked GOP House leader Liz Cheney and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , a freshman congresswoman who has espoused outlandish and dangerous conspiracy theories, will help establish the extent to which a loyalty oath to the ex-President remains the party's dominant principle.

Cheney is expecting to confront a venting session over her vote of conscience to impeach Trump in the House Republican Conference on Wednesday. In the coming days she faces a fight to hang onto her leadership post. She is also confronting a potential primary challenge at home over her decision.

Party leaders will meanwhile resume consideration of whether to censure Greene, who spent several hours in a meeting with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday evening. There is pressure from Democrats and Senate Republicans for her to lose committee assignments over offensive social media activity before she ran for office and her behavior in only a month as a Georgia representative.

The challenges facing Cheney and Greene encapsulate the raging battle for the control of the GOP between orthodox conservatives and pro-Trump radicals who are viewed by the establishment as a ""cancer"" and ""wacky weeds.""

Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is the epitome of the old school, ultra-conservative but internationalist Republican Party that disdains Trump's assault on democracy. Greene is a proponent of the QAnon conspiracy theory and is an avatar of the wild fringe welcomed into the GOP by Trump.

McCarthy's painstaking effort to walk a line between the wings of the party represented by the two lawmakers was made immeasurably more difficult when, according to Greene , she and Trump spoke in a recent phone call, The former President's power play came after he received McCarthy for an audience at his Florida resort. The visit was a stunning indication of how Trump is still calling the shots for much of the House GOP -- even after his mob invaded the Capitol in a January 6 insurrection

In a somber reminder of the cost of Trump's actions, President Joe Biden traveled to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to honor fallen Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick who died as a result of the assault. Sicknick's cremated remains lay in repose in the very Rotunda breached by Trump's rioters nearly a month ago.

No sign of regret from Greene

The volatile state of the GOP is evident in the way that Cheney faced far more public criticism from her House colleagues than Greene, an advocate of a fringe conspiracy theory anchored on baseless claims that Democratic leaders are pedophiles.

Two officials familiar with her meeting with McCarthy told CNN's Manu Raju on Tuesday evening that the GOP Steering Committee has not decided whether to strip Greene of her committee posts. There was no indication that Greene has shown any remorse for her extreme behavior, which includes past support for the assassination of top Democratic officials, 9/11 trutherism and claims that the Parkland, Florida, school massacre in 2018 was a false flag hoax.

McCarthy asked if Greene would apologize for her past comments and views, which she did not agree to, a person with knowledge of the matter tells CNN. Another person familiar with their conversation also said that McCarthy provided a slew of options to her, including that she could show remorse and apologize.

Top GOP senators, like Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have defended Cheney. But emphasizing her growing estrangement from the GOP House caucus, a Trump acolyte, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, even traveled to Wyoming last week to rally against her and to initiate an effort designed to end her career. The visit underscored how Trump's loyal base is still dictating the party's direction, even with the ex-President out of the White House and as some GOP power players hope his influence will fade.

Tensions sure to rise over impeachment trial

The tussle that is tearing the House GOP apart -- and alienating its members from their brethren in the Senate -- is coming at an especially fraught moment with the second Trump impeachment trial set to start in the Senate next week.

The former President's team indicated Tuesday that it intends to once again highlight Trump's dangerous lies about a stolen election, while Democrats present graphic evidence of his insurrection that will discomfort GOP senators.

The outcome of the drama involving Cheney and Greene are skirmishes in the wider search for the GOP's identity that will shape the run-up to midterm races next year and weigh on the GOP's chances of fielding candidates capable of helping recapture Congress -- a crucial consideration for Biden's presidency.

Fundamentally, the fight that rips away at the Republican Party every day is the one ignited the moment that Trump declared his candidacy for president in 2015 and directed the GOP on a wild populist, nationalist ride.

It has been exacerbated by a generation of pro-Trump figures inspired to run for Congress by his success.

The choice before House Republicans was best captured by John Thune, one of several Senate Republicans who spoke up after their leader McConnell rejected Greene's ""loony lies and conspiracy theories"" as a ""cancer"" for the party.

Thune argued Tuesday that ""the House Republicans are going to have to decide who they want to be.""

""Do they want to be the party of limited government and fiscal responsibility, free markets, peace through strength and pro-life, or do they want to be the party of conspiracy theories and QAnon, and I think that is the decision they've got to face,"" Thune said.

Another mainstream Republican, the party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- who is now an outlier cut off by the Trumpian tide -- also weighed in.

""I think our long history as a party has shown that it's important for us to separate ourselves from the people that are the wacky weeds,"" the Utah senator said. ""If we don't, then our opposition tries to brand us with their image and with their point of view, which has been detrimental to any party that doesn't do that.""

GOP is hostage to its most radical elements

The challenge for the broader Republican Party, however, is that there is plenty of evidence that the party's activist base is not excited by small government, debt reduction, globalization and a hawkish foreign policy -- four pillars of the Republican Party for decades between Ronald Reagan and Trump.

""We have to be aware that Marjorie Taylor Greene has a very wide following in this country,"" said Gabriel Sterling, one of the Republican electoral officials who stood firm against Trump's attempt to steal the election in Georgia.

""I mean, she's raised millions of dollars based on things that she said and sometimes ... being attacked by the quote/unquote 'elites' only drives her up in terms of the esteem she's viewed by many, many people,"" Sterling told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Tuesday.

In many ways, this is a schism that the Republican Party in Washington has brought on itself, and that is already more destabilizing than the influxes of radical lawmakers brought into Washington by the Tea Party uprising and New Gingrich's Republican revolution that captured the House in 1994.

Four years of appeasing Trump's uncouth character, unconstitutional power grabs and appeals to baser instincts -- in a Faustian pact that returned a conservative Supreme Court -- has effectively provided an entry path into the party for the extremists who found inspiration in the ex-President.

McConnell is turning against die hard Trumpists like Greene and Capitol Hill insurrectionists now. But his failure for weeks to condemn the ex-President's assaults on the integrity of the election helped brew the crazed atmosphere that Trump exploited when he incited the Capitol insurrection on January 6.

The strength of the pro-Trump faction in the GOP -- at a time when more traditional conservatives like McConnell would like to rid themselves of his influence -- was underscored by the fact that a majority of House Republicans voted not to certify Biden's election win over election fraud lies.

And even in the Senate, 45 Republicans -- including McConnell -- voted to support Sen. Rand Paul's attempt to have the impeachment trial that begins next week declared unconstitutional.

The conundrum for the wider GOP is that the path to fundraising riches, fame and primary success lies in sponsorship from Trump. McCarthy's pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to meet the ex-President last week shows that he believes his hope of winning the House lies closer to Greene's appeal than Cheney's.

Senate Republicans however have long memories about past races squandered by extremist candidates. And Trump's style of politics just cost the party two runoff elections in Georgia that handed the Senate to Democrats.

""Whose side do I want to be on? Liz Cheney or Marjorie Taylor Greene?"" former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who was himself driven out of the party because of his opposition to the Trump revolt, asked on ""The Situation Room"" with Wolf Blitzer, in encapsulating the electoral conundrum facing an increasingly ungovernable GOP.

""Where do you think the party will likely grow more or where do I want to be as an elected official? It is pretty stark and that is what the party is facing right now."""
Blinken speaks with families of US hostages and wrongful detainees,"(CNN) Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked on Tuesday with the loved ones of Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad -- a gesture of support from the new administration that garnered high praise from the families who spoke with CNN.

It sent a promising signal, the families said, that the Biden administration will make the release of their loved ones a priority, and they expressed hope that the top US diplomat's investment would translate into bringing their family members home.

""It just made my heart sing. I felt like a whole weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I felt heard. I felt cared for. And it was just, it was awesome to feel that way,"" said Paula Reed, whose son Trevor Reed is imprisoned in Russia. ""I was crying when we got off (the call); it was just so emotional.""

According to the Foley Foundation , there are at least 43 publicly known hostage or detainee cases in 11 countries, including Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela, Russia, Egypt, Turkey, Rwanda and Saudi Arabia.

The video call was well-attended by family members and officials from hostage advocacy organizations, including the Foley Foundation, according to those who spoke to CNN. Blinken took time beyond the allotted hour to field questions from those in attendance.

""Secretary Blinken was patient and kind to answer all of our questions and concerns with real concern for each individual case. We are truly thankful,"" Maryam Kamalmaz told CNN. Her father, Majd Kamalmaz , is a humanitarian worker who disappeared in Syria in 2017.

Gabriela Zambrano Hill, whose dad and uncle, Alirio Jose Zambrano and Jose Luis Zambrano, are detained in Venezuela as part of the so-called CITGO 6 , called the meeting ""extremely encouraging,"" telling CNN that ""Secretary Blinken made it very clear that advocating for the release of US hostages is a priority for this administration.""

""It truly was a great gesture from him to take time to speak with families like us -- and so soon, just a week since being confirmed,"" said Cristina Vadell, whose father, Tomeu Vadell, is another member of the ""CITGO 6.""

Elizabeth Whelan -- the sister of Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia for more than two years -- said Blinken promised to be ""very clear and transparent with the families as to what was going on, what wasn't going to happen, so that we understood exactly where we stood regarding the different cases.""

Some of the family members who spoke to CNN said they thought the call would buoy their spirits of their loved ones. Several said Blinken indicated that this was just an introduction and it would not be the last time he spoke with them.

In a readout of the call, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Blinken ""stressed the importance the Biden-Harris Administration places on transparency in our communications with families and ensured that their family members are a top priority in our diplomatic engagements with both allies and adversaries.""

Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, who was asked to stay on after serving during the Trump administration, said he left the call ""feeling motivated, optimistic, and (frankly) emotional.""

""@SecBlinken emphasized transparency in our partnership with families of U.S. hostages and wrongful detainees, and I am grateful for their willingness to put their faith and trust in us,"" he wrote on Twitter.

However, despite their optimism, several family members pointed out that work remains for the government as well as for the personal advocacy on behalf of their loved ones.

""The family is constantly involved in working for their loved ones' release until their loved one comes home,"" said Whelan, who described it as sometimes overwhelming.

Others also noted that it was a call in which they wished they didn't have to participate.

""Everyone doesn't really want to be on that call, right, because of what it means. It's unfortunate. But at the same time, I'm pretty sure that when everybody hung up, each family, no matter how encouraged they were or weren't with whatever he said, felt just at least a little bit better,"" Vadell said.

CLARIFICATION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized Elizabeth Whelan's description of Blinken in the meeting. She said he promised to be transparent in discussing their cases."
House approves new fines for members who don't complete security screening before entering floor,"(CNN) The House of Representatives has officially created a new rule that will fine any member for failing to complete security screening prior to entering the House floor.

With the passing of this rule Tuesday evening, members who fail to comply with security screenings will be fined $5,000 for the first offense and $10,000 for a second offense. These fines would be deducted directly from members' salaries by the chief administrative officer.

When metal detectors were installed outside of the House floor January 12 for all members and staffers to walk through, many lawmakers aired their frustrations . Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who filmed a campaign advertisement vowing to carry her handgun around Capitol Hill prior to arriving in Washington, was also involved in a standoff with Capitol Police while trying to get on the floor when the metal detectors were newly installed. Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland tried to take a concealed firearm on the House floor.

On Tuesday evening, lawmakers appeared compliant with the new security measures and went through the metal detectors before entering the House floor. The vote was 216-210 in favor of the new rule.

Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat who's chairman of the Rules Committee, said on the House floor Tuesday why it was important for members to abide by the metal detectors.

New York governor signs bill to repeal 'walking while trans' ban,"New York (CNN) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill Tuesday repealing a controversial statute commonly known as the ""walking while trans"" ban.

Both houses of the New York Legislature voted Tuesday to pass the bill that repeals a 1976 penal law statute aimed at prohibiting loitering for the purpose of prostitution, but which ultimately led to years of law enforcement discrimination against trans people of color.

The statute ""led to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by targeting women from marginalized groups that are at high risk for sex trafficking and other exploitation and abuse,"" according to the sponsor memo from state Sen. Brad Hoylman.

The statute allowed police to ""stop-and-frisk trans women of color and other marginalized groups for simply walking down the street,"" Hoylman said in a news release

""This outdated, discriminatory statute has led to hundreds of unnecessary arrests of transgender women of color and a broader culture of fear and intimidation for transgender and gender nonconforming New Yorkers,"" Hoylman said.

From 2012 to 2015, 85% of people arrested under the penal law were Black or Latinx, according to city arrest statistics cited in the sponsor memo.

""Officers have expressly warned transgender women that 'girls like them' would be arrested if they were seen outside after midnight. One officer, when asked how he was trained to identify prostitutes, testified that he was trained to look for women with Adams apples, big hands and big feet,"" it says.

The Legal Aid Society filed a class action lawsuit against the City of New York and New York Police Department (NYPD) officers in 2016 on behalf of several transgender women who argued they'd been unjustly targeted by law enforcement under the law.

That lawsuit resulted in the NYPD revising its patrol guide in 2019 regarding loitering for purposes of engaging in a prostitution, ""which now specifically prohibits officers from relying on 'gender, gender identity, clothing, and location' alone or in combination to establish probable cause, and requires more detailed factual narratives about officers' observations,"" a Legal Aid Society news release says.

CNN reached out to NYPD officials for comment on the new legislative change but did not immediately hear back.

District attorneys in New York have also declined to prosecute cases connected to the penal law in recent years.

""The Legal Aid Society has represented women assumed to be loitering for prostitution because they were wearing a 'short dress,' 'a skirt and high heels,' 'tight black pants,' or 'a black dress.' Women were also targeted for standing outside, speaking to one another, or walking from a subway or grocery store back to their residence,"" the organization said in a news release Tuesday.

Cuomo, in a statement released after he signed the bill into law, called the statute ""archaic.""

""COVID exposed low tide in America and the 'walking while trans' policy is one example of the ugly undercurrents of injustices that transgender New Yorkers -- especially those of color -- face simply for walking down the street,"" Cuomo said in the statement.

""For too long trans people have been unfairly targeted and disproportionately policed for innocent, lawful conduct based solely on their appearance. Repealing the archaic 'walking while trans' ban is a critical step toward reforming our policing system and reducing the harassment and criminalization transgender people face simply for being themselves."""
What's gotten into Mitch McConnell? (opinion),"Richard N. Bond was the Republican National Committee Chairman from 1992-1993. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has recently become the Republican Party's leading truth teller. He started by directly blaming Donald Trump for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot, something most of his fellow Republican senators have been unwilling to do.

Then he made two additional comments this week that have placed him head and shoulders above his colleagues in acknowledging the danger the GOP is in as it looks to the future.

Now McConnell is condemning ""loony lies and conspiracy theories,"" such as those issuing from Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (though he avoided naming her), including questioning whethe r 9/11 happened and her assertions that some mass shootings were staged. McConnell called them a ""cancer for the Republican Party.""

As a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and longtime McConnell observer, I enthusiastically endorse all of his recent moves. But it is fair to ask: What's gotten into Mitch?

I think it's two things: freedom from the shackles of the Trump presidency, and his astute political calculation that he has a now-or-never opportunity to lead the GOP away from the toxicity of Trump and QAnon crazies like Greene.

It was no secret in the Senate that McConnell had little use for Trump, indeed on occasion calling him ""nuts."" But the two men found common cause in appointing right-leaning judges, cutting taxes and moving the country in a conservative direction.

Indeed, McConnell undoubtedly had his eye on that cooperation ahead of the two Georgia runoff elections last month that could have (but didn't) secured his Senate leadership, when he said that Trump was ""within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options"" as Trump tried to prove that ""voter fraud"" had robbed him of the election (a claim that would soon be rejected dozens of times by the courts).

But their already-shaky relationship broke when McConnell acknowledged Joe Biden as president-elect on December 6, after the Electoral College certified him the winner. An enraged Trump accused McConnell of ""jumping ship"" and issued a graphic making the absurd allegation that he, Trump, had been responsible for McConnell's reelection.

The truth is that McConnell has won election seven times, beating his opponents by an average of 12 points and last year by a whopping 20 points. This was hardly Trump's doing.

The Trump-McConnell breakdown worsened with the loss of two Republican Senate seats in Georgia, followed by the Trump mob's violent assault on the Capitol. McConnell rightly held Trump culpable for both the election losses and the riot, pointing out that Trump's incessant claims of election fraud in Georgia and elsewhere depressed GOP turnout and ignited the violent insurrection.

McConnell has since hinted that he is open to convicting Trump in next week's Senate impeachment trial, depending on the evidence presented by the House impeachment managers. (He did, however, vote last week along with 44 GOP senators to keep alive an effort to dismiss the Senate impeachment trial on constitutional grounds.)

Unlike most of his colleagues, though, McConnell knows that the GOP is at a tipping point. Republicans can continue to embrace Trump's toxicity and big-lie tactics and continue to coddle extremists. Or, they can, like the fictional newscaster Howard Beale in ""Network,"" declare that they are mad as hell, are not going to take it anymore, and are going to change their ways and reclaim their party.

McConnell knows the GOP still holds a winning hand. In the 50-50 Senate, they can block most liberal excesses. Moreover, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi holds the slimmest majority in over 20 years and will be unable to run roughshod. The 6-3 conservative edge on the Supreme Court also will serve as a further brake on the Democrats.

So have at him, Mitch. Will you really rise to the moment and gather 17 GOP votes to convict Trump, and ban him from ever holding federal office again? On behalf of many Americans who want to lower the volume in Washington and return to civility, I pray that you do."
Georgia secretary of state investigating whether pro-Trump attorney voted illegally,"(CNN) Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has launched an investigation into whether attorney Lin Wood voted as a legal resident in the November election, a source with Raffensperger's office confirmed to CNN.

Wood, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, was one of the lawyers who unsuccessfully pushed a handful of lawsuits to block Georgia's election results after alleging fraud. The cases were rapidly dismissed by the courts and described as disinformation by state election officials.

Wood said in a statement to CNN, ""I have been a resident of the State of Georgia since 1955. I have changed my residency to South Carolina yesterday.""

""This is pure harassment by the Georgia Secretary of State,"" he added before pushing more baseless voter fraud allegations.

Amazon gets court to block $3.3 billion retail deal involving India's richest man,"(CNN Business) Amazon has been handed a major legal victory in its fight to block a multibillion-dollar deal between two of India's biggest retailers.

A court in the country's capital, New Delhi, ruled on Tuesday that an agreement by Reliance Industries to purchase local rival Future Retail for $3.3 billion should be put on hold afterobjected to it last year. The Delhi High Court said it was ""satisfied that immediate orders are necessary to protect the rights of [Amazon]"" and ordered all parties involved in the deal to ""maintain status quo"" pending its final judgment.

""We have utmost respect for the Indian legal system and appreciate the interim order of the ... Delhi High Court,"" an Amazon spokesperson told CNN Business.

Future Retail said in a statement that it would ""explore all legal remedies and take appropriate steps to pursue"" its deal with Reliance. The company could potentially challenge any judgment in a higher court.

Reliance declined to comment.

The ruling is the latest development in what is shaping up to be a proxy battle between two of the world's wealthiest men for India's fast-growing online retail market. What's at stake is strategic access to a network of popular grocery stores and retail shops in India, something both Jeff Bezos' Amazon and Reliance — owned by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani — want to either have for themselves, or to prevent the other from acquiring.

At the heart of the current battle is Future Retail, the cash cow of Indian conglomerate Future Group. The retail unit includes brands such as Big Bazaar, a popular supermarket chain. In August 2019, Amazon invested in a Future Group entity that gave it a roughly 4.8% stake in Future Retail as of September 30 last year, according to securities filings . The deal gave Amazon the right of first refusal to acquire more shares in Future Retail, according to one of the filings

Amazon argued that the 2019 deal struck between it and the Future Group entity included a non-compete clause, a person familiar with Amazon's perspective told CNN Business in October last year. The clause listed 30 restricted parties with which Future Retail and Future Group could not do business, and Reliance was on that list, the person said.

Amazon sought to enforce that agreement through the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), with the Southeast Asian country often seen as a neutral jurisdiction to settle disputes. The SIAC emergency arbitrator ordered a temporary halt to the deal last October.

While Future Group had raised questions about the validity of the Singapore arbitration court's order in India, the Delhi High Court declared Tuesday that the order is ""enforceable.""

Walmart WMT Amazon and-owned Flipkart dominate online shopping in India, controlling more than 60% of the market between them. But Ambani and Reliance have made an aggressive play for a slice of that market through JioMart, an initiative announced in 2019 to bring online thousands of India's mom-and-pop stores known as ""kiranas.""

Ambani definitely has the resources to match Amazon. His tech subsidiary, Jio, has more than 400 million users, and Reliance Retail has more than 12,000 stores across India.

According to analysts, Future Retail's 1,500-odd stores are not a must-have for either company but the legal fight could turn into an ""ego battle"" between the two billionaires.

And while it's currently advantage Amazon, that battle is far from over."
"Democrats look to barrel ahead with 'big, bold' Covid-19 relief plan","(CNN) Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said President Joe Biden told Senate Democrats at lunch Tuesday that he wants a ""big, bold package"" on Covid-19 relief and that he told Senate Republicans that their $600 billion proposal is ""way too small.""

It was a point White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated during her briefing -- there are certain ""bottom lines"" that Biden wants to be in the next round of Covid-19 relief, including direct payments reaching more Americans than what the Republican proposal would include.

""His view is that at this point in our country, when 1-in-7 American families don't have enough food to eat, we need to make sure people get the relief they need and are not left behind,"" Psaki said.

She again said the administration views the risk ""is not going too big, it is going too small.""

Schumer also warned fellow lawmakers not to repeat ""the mistake of 2009"" and risk undershooting the stimulus package on a call Tuesday with his caucus, Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, an aide to a Democratic senator told CNN.

"Mickey Callaway, Angels pitching coach, accused of sexually inappropriate behavior","(CNN) The Los Angeles Angels suspended pitching coach Mickey Callaway on Tuesday following a report by The Athletic alleging Callaway sent inappropriate pictures and unprompted texts to at least five female reporters over a span of at least five years.

In a wide-ranging report by The Athletic, one woman, who spoke out on the condition of anonymity, accuses Callaway -- who was the New York Mets manager for two seasons -- of ""thrusting his crotch near her face"" while the reporter was conducting an interview with Callaway.

Another reporter claims Callaway said he'd share information about his former team the Mets if the journalist got drunk with him.

Two of the women interviewed said they had been warned about Callaway's repeated inappropriate behavior, according to The Athletic. One reporter told the publication that Callaway's lewd behavior ""was the worst-kept secret in sports.""

CNN has made repeated attempts to contact Callaway for a comment, including inquiries through the Angels.

Experts split on delaying Covid-19 vaccine second doses. Here's why,"(CNN) To help speed up Covid-19 vaccinations across the United States, especially among high-risk older adults, one idea continues to surface: Postpone second doses. The idea is that delaying second doses for those who have already received a first dose would allow for more people in prioritized groups to get at least one dose if they haven't received it already.

""We get down the list faster if we do all those first doses,"" Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health , told CNN on Monday.

""My view is that the weight of the evidence suggests that we would probably save more lives by delaying second doses than by insisting on the schedule that was tested in the trials,"" he said.

Yet not all experts agree that changing dosing schedules is a good idea.

""We have two problems with that. The first -- they may not get fully protected and that might accelerate the rate of variants taking over and causing us much more trouble in the future,"" William Haseltine, chair and president of the global think tank ACCESS Health International , said during an appearance on CNN's New Day on Monday.

""Secondly, we really don't know if delaying the second dose for a long time is going to give you the same degree of protection,"" he said. In other words, there's not much research as Covid-19 vaccines were developed only recently.

Meanwhile, as debates around delaying second doses continue in the United States, so do a slow vaccine rollout, more Covid-19 deaths and the spread of newly identified coronavirus variants that appear to be more transmissible.

Getting second doses is priority, but 'there is some wiggle room'

It is still recommended for people to get their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine on time, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a virtual White House briefing on Monday.

JUST WATCHED Dr. Fauci says US won't delay second dose of vaccine Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dr. Fauci says US won't delay second dose of vaccine 01:32

""Until we have further data,"" Walensky said, people should continue to follow the data from trials by continuing the schedule of receiving two doses 21 days apart for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 28 days apart for the Moderna vaccine. Those are the two vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the United States.

""The policy is that we certainly want everyone who gets a first dose to get their second dose,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to President Biden and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during Monday's briefing.

But also on Monday, during a meeting of the International AIDS Society, Fauci said that if you're late by just a couple of weeks there isn't a cause for concern. ""There is some wiggle room,"" he said. ""It's not the end of the world if you delay a little bit. If you want to delay it by six months, that's different.""

Delaying second doses would go against the vaccine schedules that have been authorized under the US Food and Drug Administration.

In January, the FDA made clear that it does not plan to change coronavirus vaccine dosing schedules -- and for such adjustments to occur, the vaccine manufacturer would have to specifically ask the agency to adjust authorization.

CNN confirmed with the FDA in January that if a manufacturer requests a change to its emergency use authorization, the manufacturer would need to submit data to the FDA supporting the requested change.

Some experts argue that there is evidence to support a possible change.

'We need to have a really comprehensive review and discussion of this'

Lipsitch of Harvard University is in favor of spreading out vaccine doses in a larger population rather than doubling doses for half of that population. ""If you can get at least half the benefit, then it's better to spread it out,"" he said.

For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, called BNT162b2, data suggest that the vaccine has 52% efficacy after just one dose and then provides 95% protection against Covid-19 after two doses.

In a Phase 3 trial that was conducted at 99 sites in the United States, data suggest that Moderna's vaccine mRNA-1273 showed efficacy after the first dose.

But trials haven't been conducted to test single doses of mRNA vaccines.

Some emerging evidence in a pre-print paper , posted to the online server medrxiv.org on Monday, found that after getting just one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine, people who were previously infected with the virus tended to have antibody levels that were at or above those of people who had gotten both doses but never been previously infected. The study does not specify which vaccine participants received.

For many other vaccines -- such as the chickenpox, HPV and measles, mumps and rubella vaccines -- their second-dose booster shots are given several months later, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN on Monday.

""At this point, everything we know about vaccines suggests that actually the protection may be enhanced by giving a booster several months after the first dose,"" said Osterholm, who was a coronavirus adviser to the Biden transition team.

JUST WATCHED Dr. Fauci discusses how variants can affect vaccine efficacy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dr. Fauci discusses how variants can affect vaccine efficacy 02:22

Osterholm pointed to a letter-to-the-editor that published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases last week, in which Dr. Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Neal Halsey of Johns Hopkins University calculated about how many people could be protected against Covid-19 if single doses are given.

The researchers hypothesized, ""suppose that 1 million people are to be vaccinated but only 1 million doses are available. If two doses are given to each vaccinee and the efficacy is 95%, 475,000 people will be protected. If single doses are given and the efficacy is 80%, 800,000 people will be protected.""

Osterholm said that getting people vaccinated -- even with just one dose for now -- remains urgent as more coronavirus variants circulate , including the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.351 first identified in South Africa, P.1 variant first identified in Brazil and the L452R first seen in California.

""We need to have a really comprehensive review and discussion of this as quickly as possible because you know this new variant B.1.1.7 could cause a surge in our cases within weeks,"" Osterholm said. He described the emergence of these variants as similar to a hurricane approaching on the horizon.

""I feel like I'm sitting here on a beautiful beach -- the light breeze, perfectly blue skies and everybody -- and I'm telling them to start to evacuate. People are saying, 'Are you crazy?' But I see that 450 miles south, there's a category five hurricane,"" Osterholm said. ""That's the challenge. How do you get people to take action?""

Other experts, however, argue that having a longer period of time between vaccine doses could come with the risk of being more vulnerable to the novel coronavirus and its variants.

Overall, Fauci said on Monday that getting vaccinated against Covid-19 can help prevent more coronavirus variants from emerging in the future.

""You need to get vaccinated when it becomes available as quickly and as expeditiously as possible,"" Fauci said during Monday's White House briefing, adding that viruses cannot mutate if they don't replicate.

White House concerned about providers holding back doses

The Biden administration expressed concern on Monday that health care providers could essentially be hoarding Covid-19 vaccine doses for second shots that could be administered for initial shots.

""We believe that some health care providers are regularly holding back doses that are intended as first doses, and instead keeping them in reserve for second doses for patients,"" Andy Slavitt, White House Covid-19 senior adviser , said at Monday's virtual briefing. ""We want to be clear that we understand why health care providers have done that, but that it does not need to happen, and should not happen.""

As of Monday, nearly 50 million doses of coronavirus vaccine have been distributed across the United States and about 32 million doses have been administered so far, according to the CDC

CDC data show that about 26 million people have received at least one dose so far -- but, among them, nearly 6 million have received their two doses.

""On January 20, states had administered 46% of their inventory. Today, that number is 62%. We are focused on this every hour of every day,"" Slavitt said on Monday.

Slavitt suggested that in some cases, patients' appointments for a first dose are being canceled and pressed the urgency in getting first doses out as quickly as possible. He said the administration's move last week to provide a three-week window into vaccine shipping plans was meant to allay concerns that second doses could get held up."
"As a voice for social justice, the legacy of Patrick Mahomes grows","The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback has the opportunity to win back-to-back Super Bowls -- such a feat was last accomplished by Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in the 2004 season -- and aims to become the youngest starting quarterback to win multiple Super Bowls.

""I know I have a pretty good job of trying to bring people together, pretty good understanding. So I'm going to try to do that. As I continue to learn about different people and different things in life I'll try to use my voice to continue to try bring people together and make the world a better place.""

On June 1, Mahomes took to social media after the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died a week earlier after pleading for help as a White police officer knelt on his neck while pinning him to the ground.

""As a kid who was born with a black dad and white mom, I have been blessed to be accepted for who I am my entire life, but that isn't the case for everyone,"" Mahomes wrote . ""The senseless murders that we have witnessed are wrong and cannot continue in our country.""

A few days later, Mahomes was part of a group of NFL players that called on the league to condemn racism , referencing the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and others.

""On behalf of the National Football League, this is what we the players would like to hear you state,"" they said. ""We, the National Football League, condemn racism and the systemic oppression of Black people. We, the National Football League, admit wrong in silencing our players from peacefully protesting. We, the National Football League, believe Black lives matter.""

Mahomes and his foundation split the cost with the Chiefs to pay for Arrowhead Stadium, where the Chiefs play their home games, to be open on Election Day as a polling place. Chiefs president Mark Donovan told reporters at the time that it cost ""six figures"" to make it happen.

""I thought it was very important not only just to get as many people out to vote as possible but also to use a place as Arrowhead where we have a lot of fun, show a lot of love and unity where people (are) coming together, and use that as a place where we can come together and vote and use our voice,"" Mahomes told NFL Media's Jim Trotter and Steve Wyche on the NFL's ""Huddle and Flow"" podcast around the election. ""I thought Arrowhead was the perfect place for it, and the Chiefs were all on board with it.""

When speaking with reporters Tuesday, Mahomes was asked if there are any current athletes he models himself after in regards to his community work. He said that he's been in touch with Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James.

""There's a lot of great, great athletes that are doing things the right way. LeBron is one of them,"" Mahomes said. ""He's someone that I can talk to and get advice from, but there's others. I mean, there's a ton of people that are using their voice to make a difference in this world, and I try to take from them and then kind of use my own voice in my own way, to make an impact in my community.""

When asked whether Mahomes could reach a level like James in terms of influence and impact overall, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid replied, ""Yeah, absolutely. I think he's got a way about him where he understands people and they are interested in things he has to say, or back, and believe in. So, I think that presents yourself with a good combination to whatever platform that you want to support or take, that you have that ability.""

In July, after signing the massive contract extension, Mahomes was asked what the number $503 million meant to him and how to push forward off the field.

""Obviously, in the time that we are in right now, there's so much opportunity to go out there and try to help the world become the best place that it can possibly be,"" Mahomes said then. ""I feel like having the security and this trust in the organization and obviously the financial help, I'll be able to do that and not only in the Kansas City community where I hope to impact as much as I can as quickly as I can, but hopefully around the world.

""To have this trust in the organization to be behind me, not only on but off the field as well, I feel like I'll be able to make a huge impact in this world in many ways and I'm just excited for the next step and to continue doing whatever I can to help achieve that."""
More than 100 bills that would restrict voting are moving through state legislatures,"(CNN) State lawmakers across the US have filed more than 100 bills since the November election aimed at reforming election procedure and limiting voter access, according to a new report from the Brennan Center for Justice .

In all, 28 states have introduced, pre-filed or are advancing 106 restrictive bills for the 2021 legislative session, a significant spike from just 35 bills in 15 states in 2020, according to the Brennan Center analysis. The majority of bills look to restrict or put limitations on how and who can vote by mail, while others look to impose photo ID laws and take a more aggressive voter purge policy, according to the report.

Their sponsors argue that the measures are necessary to restore confidence in and integrity to the voting process after it was marred by baseless allegations of voter fraud pushed by former President Donald Trump and other GOP officials, culminating with the deadly January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.

Mail-in voting was dramatically expanded in 2020 because of the pandemic as election officials and lawmakers looked to balance public health precautions with the right to vote -- and led to a dramatic shift in voter turnout, with Democrats disproportionately favoring mail-in or early voting options.

Though there has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud, Republicans nationally have made election law changes a priority this year.

Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel has said the party will be taking a ""heavy role"" in pushing for the election changes.

""It's going to be done at the state level. I think a lot of these states are already looking at their state laws,"" McDaniel said in an interview with Fox News on Monday.

Opponents of the measures say that they make the voting process less secure while also limiting voter participation.

""There are some politicians that are very concerned about the historic turnout that we saw in the 2020 election and are determined to put barriers in front of the ballot box to try and give themselves a job security play,"" Myrna Pérez, director of voting rights and elections at Brennan, said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday.

""There are some politicians who are trying to manipulate the rules of the game so some people can participate and some people can't,"" Pérez added.

Rolling back 'no excuse voting'

Among the states where Republicans are leading a charge against mail-in voting is Pennsylvania, where mail-in ballots sealed President Joe Biden 's victory over Trump. Lawmakers have offered three different proposals that look to eliminate so-called ""no-excuse"" mail voting legislation that passed in 2019 with a GOP-led legislature.

Pennsylvania state Rep. Jim Gregory, a Republican co-sponsor of one of the bills , previously told CNN that the goal is to restore ""integrity and trust"" in the voting process.

""The confusion that took place afterwards, and just the lack of faith in how things were run, is really affecting people's belief and desire to want to vote again. That is especially true in my district,"" he said.

In Arizona -- another battleground state -- that flipped to Democrats for only the second time in more than seven decades, Republicans have introduced legislation that would repeal the state's permanent early voting list -- which allows voters to automatically receive their ballots by mail for every election.

Covid-19 as an excuse for requesting absentee ballots, while a Lawmakers in Missouri are also looking to eliminate concerns aboutCovid-19as an excuse for requesting absentee ballots, while a North Dakota bill would limit who can vote by absentee ballot.

Clamping down on applications and third-party involvement

Other states like New Jersey, Texas and Washington are considering bills that would limit who can send absentee ballot applications, or how widely they can go out.

In the lead-up to the November election, Texas in particular became the center of a fight over ballot mail-in ballots applications when Harris County, which includes the state's largest city of Houston, was blocked from sending out applications to all voters amid legal fight with Republicans. The GOP argued that the applications should only go to voters qualified to vote by mail.

A slew of other bills being considered include measures that would restrict assistance to voters, would enhance witness requirements and would limit the options a voter has for returning their absentee ballot.

Requiring photo ID

Legislators in nearly a dozen states have introduced bills that would impose a photo ID requirement either for early in-person voting or voting by mail.

Proponents of photo ID requirements argue that it prevents voter fraud, although studies of recent elections show in-person voter fraud to be rare

New Hampshire Republicans introduced a bill that would require voters to include a copy of their photo ID with their absentee ballot application and when returning their completed ballots.

Similar legislation was introduced on Monday in Georgia , where Republicans split with Trump to defend the November results but have since signed on to proposed reforms.

The Granite State is also considering a bill that would prevent the use of student IDs as identification for voting. Mississippi is weighing legislation that would prohibit the use of out of state drivers' licenses.

Voter purges

GOP lawmakers are also focusing on voter roll maintenance, specifically looking to remove voters from rolls for inactivity.

An Arizona Republican legislator has introduced a bill that would remove voters who fail to vote in a four-year election cycle and fail to respond to a notice. Mississippi is considering a similar measure."
Biden signs three executive orders on immigration. Here's what they will do.,"General Lloyd Austin testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee during his conformation hearing to be the next Secretary of Defense on January 19 in Washington. Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool/Getty Images

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has dismissed hundreds of members of 42 Pentagon advisory boards, including controversial late appointments by the Trump administration, as the Pentagon announced a review of the membership of the boards Tuesday.

The announcement comes after the Trump administration appointed several loyalists to advisory boards in the final months of his administration, including former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie who served as Trump’s deputy campaign manager.

The Pentagon took no pains to hide the fact Austin took the action because of concerns the Trump administration had openly packing some boards with loyalists.

“The secretary was deeply concerned with the pace and the extent of recent changes to advisory committees and this review will allow him to get his arms around the purpose of those boards and to ensure that these boards are providing the best advice to department policies,” chief Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report Austin's decision.

Current members being told to step down are only those appointed by the Pentagon and not those appointed by the White House or Congress. For example four people appointed by the Department of Defense to a congressionally mandated commission on stripping the names of confederate generals from military bases will be removed but others on that panel to be appointed by Congress will remain.

A review of all the boards, and whether they are still needed, will now be the focus before new members are named.

“There’s no question that the frenetic activity that occurred to the composition of so many boards in just the period of November to January deeply concerned the secretary and certainly helped drive him to this decision,” Kirby added.

“Our stewardship responsibilities require that we continually assess to ensure each advisory committee provides appropriate value today and in the future, as times and requirements change,” Austin said in a memo to the department.

The 42 advisory boards cost taxpayers potentially millions of dollars each year and some of their work is believed to be potentially redundant which added to the need for the review.

The action effectively removes, for now, several hundred people serving on boards who advise on everything from defense policy, science, innovation, health issues, coastal engineering, sexual misconduct and diversity and inclusion.

More background: In December, CNN reported that former President Trump purged a Pentagon business advisory board and replaced its members with his former campaign manager and deputy campaign manager, neither of whom have served in the military or have any apparent experience with the defense industry.

One Trump loyalist expected to keep her advisory role is Kellyanne Conway who Trump named to the Air Force Academy of Visitors. Seats on that board are controlled by the President so the Austin memo does not cover those panels where the White House names members."
"A famed private investigator died after an attempted robbery. He cracked his own case, says DA","(CNN) Two men could face murder charges in connection with the death of famed private investigator Jack Palladino, who authorities say may have helped solve his own case.

Palladino, 76, fell just outside his home in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood after two men tried stealing his camera last Thursday afternoon, according to the San Francisco Police Department.

""Witnesses reported seeing a suspect in the passenger side of a vehicle in a physical struggle over the victim's camera,"" said a statement from SFPD. Palladino allegedly fell as he grabbed onto the camera while the thieves' car sped away.

When officers arrived on the scene, they found Palladino on the street suffering from injuries, a statement from the department said. The suspects did not take Palladino's camera, which is now part of the investigation -- containing key evidence.

""We know that Mr. Palladino took photos right before his injury causing death,"" said San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin during a news conference Tuesday. ""That photo we expect will be used in court as part of our case to hold the two men that caused his death accountable.""

How Anthony Fauci beat Donald Trump in 2020,"(CNN) ""People are tired of Covid. People are saying, 'Whatever, just leave us alone.' People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,"" President Donald Trump said on a campaign call in October 2020. ""He's been here for, like, 500 years. He's like this wonderful sage telling us how -- Fauci, if we listened to him, we'd have 700,000 [or] 800,000 deaths.""

Those comments were indicative of Trump's broader message to the public last fall when it came to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic: Who are you going to believe -- me or Anthony Fauci?

(Fauci, in case you have been living on another planet for the last few years, is the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.)

That was a fight Trump should not have picked, according to a detailed polling analysis by Tony Fabrizio, the lead pollster for the ex-President's reelection campaign. (The document was obtained and posted , in full, by Politico.)

In fact, it may well have cost Trump the election.

"Over one-third of young adults misuse psychoactive medications, study says","Some 34% of adults ages 18 to 25 misused their psychoactive medications, defined as opioids, stimulants, tranquilizers and sedatives, according to a study published Tuesday in the British Medical Journal.

Misusing the drug was defined as taking a prescription in larger quantities than prescribed, more frequently than prescribed, for longer than prescribed or in any way that was not specified by their health care provider. Someone taking a drug that was not prescribed to them was also considered misuse.

The misuse of psychoactive drugs can lead to overdoses, chemical dependency and in severe cases, death, said lead study author Israel Agaku, lecturer in the department of oral health policy and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.

Reseachers gathered data from surveys of US youth and young adults taken between 2015 and 2018.

Over 20% of youth ages 12 to 17 who took psychoactive medications were also found to be misusing these drugs. The higher number of young adults misusing drugs compared to youths could be attributed to a lack of parental supervision, Agaku said.

Adults could be getting these prescription medications from their peers, he said, ""which could be facilitated in social circles where there is some measure of social acceptability."" This could include performance-enhancing stimulants called ""study drugs,"" Agaku said.

Multiple prescriptions increase chance of misuse

Taking multiple psychoactive medications greatly increased the likelihood of misuse, researchers also found.

Over 60% of adults who took multiple psychoactive drugs reported misusing at least one of their prescriptions. For youth ages 12 to 17, the number was over 46%.

People can become dependent on drugs and need more to feel ""high,"" Agaku said. He also believes there might be a social component, in which people who take these drugs ""receive more social and environmental cues to engage in such behavior.""

Opioid use was the highest for both young adults and youths, with 30% of adults using psychoactive drugs taking opioids and 19% for youths.

However, stimulants and tranquilizers were by far the most misused drug. Over 40% of youths who took tranquilizers reported misusing them, and over 51% of adults who took stimulants said they misused them.

Stimulant misuse may have been high among young adults because they ""may be getting it from their healthcare providers intentionally for non-medical purposes,"" Agaku said in an email. Stimulants also have less of a stigma among young adults in environments such as college campuses, he said.

Steps forward

For psychoactive drugs like opioids, there should be a lower supply of them to the public, said Dr. Andrew Saxon, professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the study.

Starting in the 1990s, ""the message that doctors were getting was if you're a compassionate, caring physician, and your patient has pain, you'll prescribe them opioids because it's not dangerous to do so,"" Saxon said.

That was true for some patients, he said, but the opioids did more harm than good for others. Saxon recommended doctors look into other forms of treatment for their patients like cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT.

To decrease the misuse of psychoactive drugs, Agaku recommended behavior counseling as an alternative before prescribing medication. For youths in particular, he asked that parents take responsibility for their own medications to keep them out of the hands of their children."
"Shutout by allies, Canada will produce its own vaccines by the end of 2021","Ottawa (CNN) Canada says it has signed a tentative agreement with US vaccine firm Novavax to produce millions of doses of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate at a facility in Montreal.

The agreement, announced Tuesday by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is the first of several being developed as Canada says it intends to repatriate vaccine production for decades to come.

""What we're very clear on is Canada will be developing domestic manufacturing, so regardless of what could happen in the future, we will have domestic production on top of all our partnerships and contracts signed with companies around the world,"" said Trudeau during a news conference in Ottawa Tuesday.

He added that it was important for Canada to be ""self-sufficient"" in vaccine production.

Novavax is still doing clinical trials of its vaccine but submitted more data to Health Canada for review Friday. Canada has an agreement to buy 52 million doses from Novavax when and if its vaccine candidate receives Canadian approval.

Clarence Thomas' wife apologizes to his former clerks for divide that developed amid fallout over Capitol riot,"Washington (CNN) Ginni Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas and a longtime conservative activist, has apologized to his former Supreme Court clerks for her role in creating a divide between them that came after her post-election support of former President Donald Trump and her early endorsement of Trump's January 6 rally that later resulted in a deadly riot at the US Capitol, one of the justice's former clerks and a source familiar with the online discussions confirmed to CNN.

""I owe you all an apology. I have likely imposed on you my lifetime passions,"" Thomas wrote in mid-January to an email list comprised of former clerks and their spouses and partners.

The emails were first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday.

""My passions and beliefs are likely shared with the bulk of you, but certainly not all. And sometimes the smallest matters can divide loved ones for too long. Let's pledge to not let politics divide THIS family, and learn to speak more gently and knowingly across the divide,"" Thomas wrote to the former clerks.

""I would ask those of you on the contrary side to have grace and mercy on those on my side of the polarized world, and feel free to call and talk to me individually about where I failed you as a friend here,"" she said. ""I probably need more tutoring ... Otherwise, on behalf of both of us, be assured of our love for each of you.""

Opinion: Joe Manchin's realism is just what the country needs,"Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) For some politicians, being the fulcrum of nearly every hot-button issue would be hell. But for the Gentleman from West Virginia, I suspect it is almost heaven.

Sen. Joe Manchin, widely viewed as the most conservative Democrat in the now 50-50 US Senate, has announced he will support the budget resolution on Covid-19 relief being introduced by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders. In so doing, Manchin has laid down a marker: he is with his party at the beginning of this process, but if the Democrats cannot bring some Republicans along by the end, they may not be able to count on him in the final vote.

Manchin's insistence on moderation and bipartisanship is deeply felt, and Washington DC had better get used to it. They are going to see a lot of it in the next two years.

Some label Manchin's approach as centrism, and it is in a sense. But what really is the center? It is not merely splitting the difference between the extremes. Rather, it is the pragmatic place from which a divided nation can find a consensus for action -- and action in the Joe Biden era means some movement in a progressive direction.

And so, on the matter of reconciliation, Manchin is aligned with a Democratic Socialist from Vermont -- for now. But alliances may shift over time, as Manchin strives to hold the Senate in the moderate mainstream.

In 1949, as the globe was transitioning from World War to Cold War, a young historian named Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. wrote a book called "" The Vital Center ."" It made the case that government-regulated market capitalism was the sweet spot between fascism on the right and communism on the left.

The phrase caught on, as did the concept. President John F. Kennedy, to whom Schlesinger was close, took the label and ran with it. Kennedy used it to describe the office of the presidency itself, which he called ""the vital center of action in our whole scheme of government."" And when I worked for former President Bill Clinton, he was fond of applying the phrase to domestic politics: the vital center, to him, was a third way between the fringes of the two political parties.

While there is some truth to the left-right paradigm, it seems to me the real divide in American politics is between the reality-based world and the conspiracy-addled fabulists. No discussion of the political center is honest or accurate without recognizing that the two parties' fringes are not equidistant from the center. For example, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, who has trafficked in conspiracy theories and bigotry, cannot be portrayed as merely the GOP's version of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive New York Democrat, who argues in favor of a higher minimum wage and health care access for all. You may disagree with Ocasio-Cortez's agenda, but she operates in the world of facts -- not fiction.

A confession: I know and like Manchin. I have since the days he was an up-and-comer in the Mountain State and helped the 1992 Bill Clinton-Al Gore ticket win a landslide in his state, carrying 42 of its 55 counties . His commitment to helping everyday Americans facing real problems in the real world led him to take a leadership position in crafting a temporary Covid-19 relief bill in the closing days of the Donald Trump presidency (for which I praised him then.)

Like all politicians, I agree with him on some issues, and disagree on others. But what I like about him is his rock-ribbed commitment to the reality-based world.

With the narrowest possible majority in the Senate, it is simply not realistic to expect to see Biden sign radical, revolutionary bills into law. Nor is it realistic (nor decent) to ignore the pain of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs , and the families of hundreds of thousands who have lost their lives due to the pandemic.

And so Manchin is in the hot seat. So hot that, last week, Vice President Kamala Harris beamed into West Virginia television station WSAV. She never mentioned Manchin by name, but she did say , ""The President and I feel very strongly that these are the moments when we are facing a crisis of unbelievable proportion (and) that the American people deserve their leaders to step up and stand up for them.""

Manchin expressed annoyance that Harris had come into his state (albeit via satellite) without telling him first. And soon the White House was back to playing good cop, with press secretary Jen Psaki soothingly assuring us, ""Not only is he (Manchin) a key partner to the President and to the White House on this package, but on his agenda and we will remain in close touch with him.""

Interestingly, the Harris interview may have had a more beneficial impact on an unintended target: West Virginia's Democrat-turned-Republican Gov. Jim Justice. On Monday, Justice told CNN's Poppy Harlow that fiscal responsibility is less important than immediate action in this crisis. ""If we actually throw away some money right now, so what?"" Justice said . ""We have really got to move and get people taken care of and get people back on balance and I want to work with the Biden administration just like I worked with the Trump administration and I want us to move forward.""

This leaves Manchin in the unusual position of potentially wanting to spend less than his pro-Trump governor, while simultaneously being nudged to spend more by the Democratic White House. One Manchin aide told me he is unfazed: ""For Senator Manchin, it is less about carving out a lane in the middle and more about identifying what's best for West Virginia and the country.""

Manchin has spent decades in the whitewater of West Virginia politics. He will likely support the highest level of spending that can pass with some modicum of Republican support. Rather than labeling that as centrism, it more accurate to call it realism."
Biden administration prepares to open overflow facility for migrant children,"(CNN) The Biden administration is opening an overflow facility for unaccompanied migrant children apprehended at the US-Mexico border, the federal agency tasked with the children's care told CNN in a statement.

The Health and Human Services Department will reopen a facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas, that can accommodate about 700 children and can be expanded if necessary.

The reopening of the facility comes amid an increase in apprehensions of unaccompanied children on the Southwest border, fueled in part by deteriorating conditions in Latin America and a perceived possible relaxation of enforcement, and reduced capacity limits at other facilities due to Covid-19. It also comes as President Joe Biden rolls out new immigration executive orders tackling migration to the US southern border.

Unaccompanied children who cross the border are taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security and referred to HHS, though a Trump-era policy also makes them subject to expulsion . If placed in care, case managers work to place a child with a sponsor in the United States, like a parent or relative.

The facility in Carrizo Springs will be used for children who are medically cleared from Covid-19 quarantine and will not be used for those younger than 13, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency within HHS that is responsible for the care of migrant children.

As of Thursday, there were approximately 4,730 children in Office of Refugee Resettlement care.

""HHS is mindful of these children's vulnerability, and our priority is the safety and wellbeing of each child in our care. HHS anticipates the need to start placing children at Carrizo Springs in 15 days or soon after,"" the agency said in a statement, citing limited capacity due in part to Covid-19.

Since the start of the pandemic, the agency has also had to contend with Covid-19 infections among children and staff. As of last week, there have been a total of 1,748 Covid-19 cases among children, the majority of whom have recovered and been moved from medical isolation. More than 21,000 coronavirus tests have been completed for children in the program, according to the agency.

No children who tested positive have required hospitalization, the agency said.

""The situation remains extremely fluid and can change rapidly,"" the Office of Refugee Resettlement said in a statement.

A White House spokesperson said that it's not this administration's policy to expel children apprehended at the border, a departure from the Trump administration's posture. ""The Border Patrol will continue to transfer unaccompanied children to the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement so they may be properly cared for in appropriate shelters, consistent with their best interest,"" the spokesperson said.

The Department of Homeland Security is also beginning to expand its processing capacity. US Customs and Border Protection, for example, is building soft-sided structures in Donna, Texas, to provide processing capacity in the Rio Grande Valley, one of the busiest regions for illegal border crossings, due to a nearby processing center being closed because of renovation.

While fluctuations in migration flows are common, the coronavirus pandemic complicates the usual procedures.

Trump policies can't all be reversed quickly

Under President Donald Trump, the US-Mexico border operated under hardline policies intended to keep migrants out of the United States, including a policy that required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until their court dates in the US and a public health order allowing quick expulsion of migrants encountered by border agents.

Moves to increase capacity and shelter for migrants are indicative of one of the looming challenges for the Biden administration -- more migrants at the border -- but also signal a shift from the Trump administration's posture of turning everyone away.

While administration officials have condemned Trump's actions, they're still relying on them as they sort out next steps and urging patience as they work to reverse them.

""The executive orders that were rolled out on day one and (Tuesday) is just the beginning,"" said a senior administration official. ""Fully remedying these actions will take time and require a full government approach, but President Biden has been very clear about restoring compassion and order to our immigration system.""

In the absence of information over when border policies will be pulled back, immigrant advocates and attorneys, who work directly with migrants along the southern border, have been scrambling to get clarity to advise people, many of whom are in life or death situations.

Linda Rivas, an immigration attorney and director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, a group that represents people in the so-called ""Remain in Mexico"" program, has been trying to console her clients this week, including a Honduran mother who said she had been raped while waiting in Mexico under the Trump-era policy and is now concerned for her 11-year-old son.

""Definitely a loss of hope,"" Rivas said. ""The trauma they are enduring is unimaginable."""
Every US state will see below freezing temperatures over the next week,"(CNN) It's about to get so cold that boiling water will flash freeze, frostbite could occur within 30 minutes and it will become a shock to the system for even those who are used to the toughest winters.

The coldest air of the season will be diving south, not leaving anyone out. Every single state in the US -- including Hawaii -- will reach below freezing temperatures on Monday morning.

This includes 86% of the country and 235 million people, and one blast of arctic air is responsible for much of that.

The polar vortex is to blame

This frigid cold is compliments of the polar vortex , a large area of low pressure located near the poles. During the winter months it breaks down, sending cold air that has been bottled up, southward. It can be responsible for extremely frigid temperatures and huge plunges of cold air.

The polar vortex has been weakened even more so this year by the Sudden Stratospheric Warmings that occur about six times a decade

This will cause the polar vortex to weaken even further, bringing cold air outbreaks to the US, which allows cold air that has been bottled up high int he atmosphere, to be release southward, making for bitterly cold conditions at the surface.

The cold trend will continue for the next 10 days..

A flash freeze to hit the Midwest

The cold air will start diving down through the upper Midwest and Midwest on Saturday. Places in Central Wisconsin could see temperatures plummet to -25F on Sunday, with high temperatures struggling to make it to zero.

It's a shock for some of the toughest population in the Midwest, when it comes to cold.

""We get 2-3 of these cold snaps every year,"" said National Weather Service Office Meteorologist Marcia Cronce. ""We are heading into the coldest air of the season, it will feel jolting.""

With highs right around freezing for much of the week, Madison will plummet by the end of the week with a high of only 10 degrees by Saturday. And it's not just the cold air, the wind plays a big factor too. Wind chills for areas outside Milwaukee could reach 20-30 degrees below zero Saturday and Sunday nights.

After the snow on Thursday, the coldest air of the season is looking to settle into southern WI this weekend. #swiwx pic.twitter.com/rcMxQ3uaCH — NWS Milwaukee (@NWSMilwaukee) February 2, 2021

This cold air will come on the heels of a wet snow that's expected on Thursday, which could create even more problems.

""Whatever snow and sloppy precipitation we get on Thursday and Friday, it will freeze quickly,"" Cronce said.

""You will have a short time to clear the snow before temperatures drop quickly and the roads freeze rapidly.""

Highs for much of the Midwest will run 15-20 degrees below normal. Chicago will stay in the single digits on Sunday and Monday.

The NWS office in Chicago also warned about the dangerous temperatures in their forecast discussion.

""Bitterly cold to extreme cold air mass arriving over the weekend and continuing into next week, with low temps in some spots 10 below or colder and wind chills of -20F to -30F or even colder possible on Sunday night into Monday,"" they say.

If proper clothing isn't warn, frostbite could occur in as little as 30 minutes.

An active weather pattern as of late will also turn significantly colder this weekend into early next week. Confidence is increasing in widespread sub-zero lows, with single digit highs possible. Good time to brush up on cold weather safety! https://t.co/9Sv6zy4s3r #ILwx #INwx pic.twitter.com/R7Fbg5dyaE — NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) February 2, 2021

In fact, 16 states across the Midwest and Northern Plains will experience temperatures below zero on Monday morning. That covers 16% of the country and 41 million people.

Some areas may experience coldest temperatures in years

The cold air will then continue its journey south and east as it spills over much of the South by early next week. There is still some uncertainty about how far south the arctic blast will reach.

Early this week, forecast models were showing places like Atlanta seeing the coldest air since 2018.

""If Monday morning's low of 19 degrees verifies, that would be the coldest we have been in three years,"" said NWS Atlanta Meteorologist Kyle Thiem. Atlanta hasn't seen temperatures below 20 degrees since January of 2018.

While temperatures in Atlanta will run 15 degrees below normal for this cold air event, it still won't break records. Atlanta's record low for February 8 is zero, however, when you factor in the wind chill, the temperature will feel like the single digits.

""Our biggest concerns are people outside for long periods of time,"" Thiem said. ""We always advise anyone outside to dress in layers and try to take a break and get shelter every 30 minutes or so.""

East Coast to experience temperature swing

The cold air is here to stay for at least the next week to 10 days

Temperatures across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will plummet through the day on Monday. Washington, DC, will drop to 16 on Tuesday morning and likely won't get above freezing for the remainder of the week.

Overnight lows in New York City and Philadelphia will send temperatures into the low teens on Monday morning, with highs only in the low 20s Tuesday afternoon. Boston will drop into the low teens on Tuesday morning and quite possibly won't get above the 20s for the remainder of the week.

This comes on the heels of Boston experiencing a warmer than normal January and a late start to the snowy season. The weather just might make up for that in February.

The Great Lakes thaw

The Great Lakes have been setting records this winter for the lack of ice . Lake Erie is well below where the lake should be as far as ice concentration goes. The lake is only about 1.6% frozen at the moment, and should be around 60% right now, according to the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory

The upcoming cold snap will help freeze the lakes a little bit, but it probably won't help them get to where they should be as far as ice cover goes.

Significant changes to the amount of ice cover over an extended period of time could have huge implications for the climate of the Great Lakes region. Less ice cover, combined with warmer surface temperatures, will lead to increased lake-effect precipitation in the future."
North Carolina discontinues license plates with Confederate battle flag,"(CNN) North Carolina will no longer allow specialty license plates depicting the Confederate battle flag, citing the symbol's ""potential to offend.""

At the start of 2021, the state's Division of Motor Vehicles was no longer issuing or renewing specialty license plates ""bearing the Confederate battle flag or any variation of that flag,"" said North Carolina DOT spokesman Steve Abbott in a statement.

""The Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has determined that license plates bearing the Confederate battle flag have the potential to offend those who view them,"" the statement read. ""We have therefore concluded that display of the Confederate battle flag is inappropriate for display on specialty license plates, which remain property of the state.""

The Confederate flag license plates are a specialty plate of the North Carolina Division of Sons of Confederate Veterans. The group has called the new rule ""discrimination,"" and claimed in a statement that the state is breaking the law.

""The NC-DMV has claimed that our civic group's legally registered logo may be offensive and is inappropriate for display. Make no mistake about this... We are a hereditary civic organization that takes great pride in our ancestry, our deep roots, our ethnic heritage, and our ancestor's sacrifices to the Southern States including North Carolina,"" the group said in a statement.

Opinion: 10 GOPers are throwing Biden a lifeline. He should take it,"Lanhee J. Chen is a regular contributor for CNN Opinion. He is the David and Diane Steffy Fellow in American Public Policy Studies at the Hoover Institution and the director of Domestic Policy Studies in the Public Policy Program at Stanford University. Chen previously served as the policy director of the Romney-Ryan 2012 presidential campaign and senior adviser on Policy to the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC). The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) On Monday, President Joe Biden met with 10 Republican US senators at the White House to discuss a roughly $618 billion recovery package they introduced to address the economic and health challenges created by Covid-19. The meeting should be one of many Biden has to make good on his campaign promise to work across the aisle and find a solution that can garner significant bipartisan support. A failure to do so risks not only eroding whatever goodwill he may have built with the calls for unity in his inaugural address , but also his opportunity to secure other bipartisan wins as his time in office goes on.

At the same time, congressional Democrats are moving ahead with an effort to force through relief legislation without Republican support and on a strict party-line vote. Practically speaking, there are policy, political and procedural reasons for Biden to shun this approach and instead to work with the Republican senators to finalize a recovery package this week.

First, while the Republican proposal is substantially smaller than Biden's initial bid of $1.9 trillion , it focuses on many of the key areas where additional government action would be helpful. Biden's proposal costs massively more, in no small part because it offers more direct stimulus payments to individuals and doles out another $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. All of Biden's proposed spending comes on top of the $4 trillion that Congress has already authorized to help America recover from the pandemic.

The GOP framework includes $160 billion in funding for direct Covid-19 response, including money to accelerate vaccine distribution, scale-up testing and provide financial assistance to beleaguered health care providers. It also includes a three-month extension of enhanced unemployment insurance benefits (which are scheduled to expire in March without further action), assistance for schools and small businesses, and an additional $1,000 in direct stimulus payments to families making less than $100,000 per year.

Recent economic data makes the case for more targeted relief. For example, estimates released on Monday by the Congressional Budget Office show the economy is already well on its way toward recovery. CBO concluded that the US economy is estimated to expand rapidly over the next year, growing at a robust 4.6% in 2021 and almost 3% in 2022.

Unemployment is slowly but steadily declining and the size of the civilian labor market should be in 2022 what it was before the pandemic. The size of the "" output gap ,"" or difference between what the economy will produce over the next few years and what it could produce at full potential, suggests that a more modest intervention -- something of the magnitude that the GOP package proposes -- will fully address the short-term economic challenges we face.

Separately, a number of states have reported revenues that are running ahead of expectations, easing the need for significant additional aid to states. California, for example, is expecting record revenues despite the economic shutdowns in reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic. While some states are still facing budget shortfalls, the fiscal impacts of the pandemic aren't as bad as feared, or nearly as significant as they faced in previous economic slowdowns.

Politically, the benefits to working with Republicans -- especially the group of 10 who stepped forward to advance this proposal -- far outweigh the potential blowback that Biden may get from progressives who want him to ""go big"" with this relief package. These Republican senators ( particularly Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska) hold the key to possible bipartisan agreements on other elements of Biden's legislative agenda, in areas as diverse as health care, infrastructure and immigration reform.

Unless Democrats agree to abolish the legislative filibuster, which seems unlikely given West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema 's opposition, Biden will still need significant bipartisan support to get the 60 votes he needs to move legislation to a final vote in the Senate. And he will only be able to use budget reconciliation -- a legislative process that would allow him to enact policy changes that have a substantial relationship to government revenue or spending via a simple majority vote -- twice, at most, during his first year in office. (This is because reconciliation packages must be tied to approved congressional budget resolutions. Congress has yet to pass a budget resolution for the current fiscal year and then could pass a second budget ahead for the new fiscal year, which begins on October 1.)

There's also no guarantee that even if Biden wanted to use a strictly partisan approach to advance a larger package, he'd be able to maintain the unanimous support of Democrats in the Senate to do so. Some moderate Democrats, like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have been irked by efforts to ram through relief legislation on a partisan vote (even though Manchin has now agreed to vote in favor of the budget process). Others have also expressed misgivings about the Biden proposal, which would make advancing the package with votes from his party alone a challenge.

Finally, there are procedural reasons that Biden should work with Senate Republicans to get a relief package passed as soon as possible. Starting next week, Biden's ability to find common ground will be inhibited by the start of the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump. Despite the Biden administration calls for the Senate to "" walk and chew gum "" at the same time, it will be extraordinarily difficult to negotiate an agreement on a major spending bill while a divisive impeachment proceeding is playing out on the Senate floor.

If Biden is truly interested in advancing more substantial reforms, he will have the opportunity to do that through the budget reconciliation process. There are proposals in his package sure to get minimal, if any GOP support -- significantly enhanced funding for state and local governments or a hike in the minimum wage, for example. These are the sorts of things Biden would have greater success pursuing through reconciliation when the time comes for that later this year.

For now, Republicans are offering Biden the opportunity to get some valuable policymaking done to address the health and economic challenges that are most urgent. He should seize this opportunity."
Investigators struggle to build murder case in death of US Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick,"(CNN) Investigators are struggling to build a federal murder case regarding fallen US Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, vexed by a lack of evidence that could prove someone caused his death as he defended the Capitol during last month's insurrection.

Authorities have reviewed video and photographs that show Sicknick engaging with rioters amid the siege but have yet to identify a moment in which he suffered his fatal injuries, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter said.

Soon after Sicknick died on January 7, prosecutors in Washington opened a federal murder investigation , dedicating a team inside the US attorney's office to build out a case, authorities have said.

To date, little information has been shared publicly about the circumstances of the death of the 13-year veteran of the police force, including any findings from an autopsy that was conducted by DC's medical examiner.

In a statement the day after the insurrection, Capitol Police said that Sicknick had been ""injured while physically engaging with protesters"" and collapsed as a result of his injuries sometime after returning to his office. He died the next day in a local hospital.

"'Groundhog Day,' the movie's final life lessons for our perpetual pandemic","David G. Allan is the editorial director for CNN Travel, Style, Science and Wellness. This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project , to which you can subscribe here .

(CNN) ""What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?""

That's what a depressed Phil Connors (played by actor Bill Murray) asks two men at a bar as he contemplates the bleak fate of repeating Groundhog Day over and over. One of them answers: ""That about sums it up for me.""

That about sums it up for a lot of people over the last year. As lockdowns went into place, many of us we were reminded of the film as a useful shorthand description of our new normal. No real travel. No commutes. No classrooms. Every day the same, all blurring together.

Art doesn't just imitate life. Great art helps frame life and give it meaning. I've previously made the case that the movie ""Groundhog Day"" is great art, full of practical and religious insights . And early on in the pandemic, I embraced the Groundhog Day-ness of our lives.

When our lockdown began last March, I set my morning alarm to the audio from the film of Sonny and Cher's ""I've Got You Babe"" followed by the radio DJ dialogue of ""OK campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties 'cause it's cooooold out there today...""

Just as Phil initially and selfishly embraces his temporal loop in the movie, I found some aspects of lockdown great. Working from home. Seeing my family all the time. Running and meditating on the regular. I had some creative projects I'd been wanting to tackle for years and dug in.

Then, like the plot of the film, the initial enthusiasm wore off. The word ""indefinitely"" felt more like a Sisyphean curse than an opportunity. I had nothing brilliant to show for my creative endeavors. Meditating got spotty. Some of my friends began struggling. Fear dictated daily decision-making. People I know got very sick. And above everything brewed a grim storm of pandemic death tolls, racial injustice and political rancor. Act 2 of ""Groundhog Day"" is dark. Phil enters a deep depression; even suicide is no escape for him.

Then Act 3 rescues the perpetual day. Phil comes back around to finding the upsides of being stuck in a skipping record of time. Only this phase is more enlightened. He uses the time for the service of others and in self-improvement. He masters the day, each one getting closer to perfection. Arguably, especially from a Buddhist perspective, this effort is what frees him from his time prison.

As we each pass or approach one year of lockdown, ""Groundhog Day"" still has lessons on how to manage our own loop. The last act of the film reminds us to focus on three areas that bring us closer to happiness if we can muster the effort.

Do the right thing

Phil's perfect day includes fixing someone's flat tire, catching a kid who falls out of a tree and preventing a man from choking at dinner. These are each a part of his daily round of mitzvahs.

It's worth thinking about what that looks like for us in the context of family, friends and neighbors. Maybe it's connecting more, or giving gifts of time, empathy and humor. From a public health point of view, it means avoiding indoor spaces except when necessary, masking up in public spaces, washing your hands regularly and keeping your distance. We know the drill. We just have to keep doing it.

There's a parable by Leo Tolstoy titled ""The Three Questions"" about how we should live our lives. The three answers all boil down to one philosophy: The most important thing to do is do good for those around you, right now.

Of course, we're tired of the vigilance after living it for a year. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't keep doing it, or that we can't. By one estimate, Phil repeats Groundhog Day for nearly 34 years. If you want a nonfiction benchmark, Anne Frank lived in hiding in Amsterdam during World War II for more than two years. Even as you pass 300 days of lockdown and anticipate 400, keep fixing those flat tires, keep wearing your mask over your nose. Please.

""Do not do great things,"" the writer, teacher and pacifist Colman McCarthy said. ""Do small things in a great way.""

It's the little things

Small things can also be sources of profound joy.

Stuck in our own Punxsutawneys -- the Pennsylvania town where the real-life, and movie, Groundhog Day celebration takes place -- many have been denied the things in life that make us happy such as traveling, socializing in restaurants, bars and coffee shops, and visiting extended family.

But if we're lucky (and I know many are not), we may have more opportunities now to appreciate fundamental aspects of life we can still enjoy, the kind of details we tended to overlook and take for granted back in our formerly overextended lives. There is deep contentment to be found in activities such as cooking, talking with and reading to our children, walks though nature, bonding with pets, listening to music, gazing at stars, playing board games, watching great movies, reading good books.

Now could be a good time to start or restart a gratitude journal or share with others what you're grateful for. Numerous studies have shown this simple act of counting one's blessings increases satisfaction with life

Variety is the spice of life

In Act 3 of ""Groundhog Day,"" Phil memorizes French poetry and learns to sculpt ice and play the piano. He may be stuck in the same place, but he retains his memories and builds skills that way.

Now in our own Act 3, we may be burned out on sourdough bread making, but it's not too late to still take up new skills. My wife restarted fiddle lessons. I've picked up a memoir project that had gone dormant. My older daughter has doubled down on her bullet journaling for 2021. We try to hike someplace different every weekend. My wife and younger daughter made care packages for those asking for help along freeway exits in our town. If you're bored, try to do something new, even safely within the confines of lockdown.

CNN's health and wellness writer Sandee LaMotte gave me some more suggestions: Roll a die to decide which radio station to listen to each morning. Call a new friend or family member every day. Make a game of exercise with a deck of cards where the number you draw is how many push-ups or jumping jacks you do. Make a cuisine dartboard or spin wheel to randomly pick what to make for dinner. Add a pinch of variety to give the day some spice.

Or as Phil gleefully says when he finally wakes up to the day after Groundhog Day: ""Anything different is good."""
A California man dies after falling 95-feet while canyoneering in Death Valley National Park,"(CNN) A man canyoneering in Death Valley National Park has died after falling off a cliff, according to the National Park Service (NPS).

Justin Ibershoff, 38, from Los Angeles, died on Saturday as he was descending a technical route in Deimos Canyon with six friends, the NPS said in a news release

All the party members were experienced canyoneers and had descended into this canyon several times.

Ibershoff was descending a steep, rocky slope when he stepped on a loose boulder that triggered a rockslide. He was swept past two of his friends and over the edge of a 95-foot cliff, the release said.

The friends called for assistance and after a few hours, a crew from the Navy's VX-31 helicopter were able to reach Ibershoff and establish he had passed away. His body was recovered the following day, according to the NPS.

Democrats are moving ahead without Republicans on Covid relief,"If Republicans want to come along, great. Democrats are arguing Republicans can vote for budget reconciliation. If Republicans don't like the plan, they can keep talking to the White House, but the underlying takeaway from the meeting on Monday night -- and all the messages from the White House in the days before that -- is the President is only willing to negotiate so much. Republicans' $618 billion proposal with no state and local funding is not going to cut it . Period.

Bottom line: President Joe Biden has the House. Biden has the Senate. He has a procedural process that gives him the chance to pass a $1.9 trillion relief package with just Democratic votes and conveniently, it's a process that Republicans used just four years ago to jam through a tax plan and try to repeal Obamacare.

Democrats are making a two-pronged calculation

We will see on the second point, but when you are talking about giving people direct checks , expanding unemployment insurance, giving people more money to buy food and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour , you aren't talking about unpopular ideas. Democratic aides tell CNN over and over again this isn't repealing Obamacare. They are giving people something, not taking something away, and that's emboldened members to act swiftly and decisively and not give in to talk that they have to unify the country by bringing Republicans onboard with a plan.

That doesn't mean that the impact this could have on the debt and deficit isn't real. That doesn't mean that Republicans aren't going to argue that this plan isn't needed. It's true that there are still billions from the last package that haven't gone out the door. Many Republicans argue it's irresponsible to spend more when you don't even know what you need. Those are arguments they can make to the public. But, Democrats are feeling confident that they can win that public fight.

A bit on the mechanics

One Democratic aide familiar with the Senate's process told CNN that the plan is for the House and Senate committees to work in coordination over the next week and a half to hammer out legislative text. Throughout the drafting, Democrats in the Senate will be consulting with the Senate parliamentarian to make sure their plans are actually allowed under the rules that govern reconciliation. The House will vote to pass the plan first. Then, the Senate will move.

Before the Senate goes to the floor, they will engage in multiple meetings with Senate Republican staff and the Senate parliamentarian on the merits of each provision they want included and whether the provisions meets the strict rules of what can be allowed through reconciliation. The fight over the minimum wage is expected to be a massive one here, but there will be others as well. This process happens in private over several meetings, but it's crucial to determining the scope of what Democrats can do.

The goal is to be finished and have the bill signed into law by March 14, this Senate aide tells CNN. That gives some time for lawmakers to pass this before unemployment benefits run out at the end of March.

It's a massive undertaking, but Democrats aren't working from scratch here. They are going to be taking Biden's $1.9 trillion plan and making it a bill. A lot of the work has already been done on the front end to make sure every committee has the amount of money they need to make this plan a reality. The House and Senate budgets gave 12 and 11 committees respectively reconciliation instructions. That is a lot. It's going to be messy. Aides say they are very clear about what they have to do here, and they are confident this can be done swiftly.

Still, there are going to be some intra-party schisms on how this bill ultimately looks. Not all Democrats are comfortable with raising the minimum wage to $15, for example. In New York, that amount might make sense. In Montana and West Virginia -- where the cost of living skews much lower -- that kind of minimum wage could be the difference between a business staying profitable and not. That's why you have some Democrats arguing any minimum wage increase should be regional, while others are arguing that it should be phased in.

A reminder: The twists and turns of reconciliation are going to be countless. This process is complicated, cumbersome and will force Democrats to walk through a tricky negotiation and stay together in a way they haven't had to do in recent years. Add on top of it the fact that Biden has pledged to The twists and turns of reconciliation are going to be countless. This process is complicated, cumbersome and will force Democrats to walk through a tricky negotiation and stay together in a way they haven't had to do in recent years. Add on top of it the fact that Biden has pledged to keep talking to Republicans throughout this process and the reality that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer can't lose a single member of his caucus and it's fair to say that Democrats have to operate darn near flawlessly to pull this entire thing off by mid March. Passing the budget resolution is the easy part. Getting everyone to the other side of this process without a massive internal backlash? That's a lot harder.

On power sharing: Why Democrats are still not in control of committees

The organizing resolution hasn't been passed yet.

But, the talks have dragged on. They've been productive. They are close to an agreement, but they have dragged on among staff. The initial fight over the filibuster delayed important talks over other procedural and weedy negotiations. The hope and expectation was that the agreement would look very similar to the power sharing agreement of 2001, but that 2001 agreement only lasted a few months and there are some operational changes that had to be made. It's taking time, maybe even longer than it should, but aides say they are close. It could be finished as soon as Tuesday.

The issue is now we are seeing some real effects of what that means for the way the Senate is run. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is technically still the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced Monday night he would not allow a hearing to go forward on Biden's Attorney General nominee Merrick Garland on February 8 because he argued those confirmation hearings for attorney general are typically two days. The Senate impeachment trial starts on February 9 . Again, aides say party leaders are close. We will see if this gets buttoned up Tuesday.

Keep an eye on Republicans

The Republican civil war continues on Tuesday morning.

We are watching to see if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy finally meets with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Tuesday evening and whether he kicks her off of her committees or waits for House Democrats to make that move.

House Democrats have a Rules Committee meeting scheduled on a resolution to remove her from Budget and Education on Wednesday. A reminder that just because they pass the resolution out of the Rules panel doesn't mean it has to go to the floor. It's designed to be a fail safe to force McCarthy to act.

House Democrats will have a conference call at 9 a.m. ET on Wednesday where this issue could come up. There is some growing concern that forcing Greene off committees through a floor vote could set a dangerous precedent for the future if Republicans take back the House and then use the move to oust Democrats they don't like from their committee assignments. Usually, this is a call leadership makes. Giving the full House a vote is extremely unusual."
"Tesla recalls 135,000 cars after pushing back against regulators","(CNN) Tesla ( TSLA ) is recalling 135,000 Tesla Model S sedans and Model X SUVs because their large center touchscreens can fail. Tesla had previously objected to a push to issue a recall from regulators, as it claimed that the problem wasn't a safety issue.

Under the recall, which will begin on March 30, Tesla must notify owners of cars with the failure-prone touchscreens and replace a computer chip that controls the screen. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) considers this a safety issue because without a functioning center screen, drivers lose the display for the car's backup camera and controls for the window defroster and defogger.

Even in its correspondence with NHTSA agreeing to the recall, Tesla noted that it was aware of no crashes related to the problem and said the vehicles could still be safely operated without the screen.

But in its official letter to Tesla demanding the recall, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration discounted Tesla's arguments.

""We note that your report states that Tesla believes that this matter does not have a safety risk,"" read the letter, signed by Alex Ansley, chief of NHTSA's Recall Management Division. ""In our view, this statement has no force or effect in terms of Tesla's obligation to undertake and complete the recall, and NHTSA does not agree with it.""

Thus far, Tesla has been charging customers to upgrade or replace the screens, but the costs of official recall repairs are supposed to be absorbed by the vehicle manufacturer. Tesla said in its letter to NHTSA that it will make the recall repairs for free and will offer a discount on upgraded screen hardware.

Tesla is also required to regularly report to NHTSA on its progress in repairing all 135,000 touchscreens. Automakers face fines for not repairing recalled vehicles quickly enough."
"Hal Holbrook, veteran actor who portrayed Mark Twain, dies at 95","(CNN) Hal Holbrook, a legendary Emmy and Tony Award winning actor, died January 23 at his California home, his daughter Victoria told CNN on Tuesday.

He was 95.

Holbrook portrayed iconic author Mark Twain in one-man shows for more than six decades, winning a Tony Award for best actor in 1966 for his role in ""Mark Twain Tonight!"" which he also directed.

He performed the show across the country and in Europe, becoming synonymous with the famed humorist.

Born in Cleveland to a vaudeville performer mother and shoe salesman father, Holbrook and his siblings were raised by his grandparents in South Weymouth, Massachusetts.

Sent to boarding school as a youngster, and later military school, he found solace in the costumes and characters he portrayed in drama club.

Holbrook first got the idea to do the Twain show after portraying the author as part of an honors project as a drama major at Denison University in Granville, Ohio.

While serving in the Army during WWII, he performed in amateur theater productions, including ""Madam Precious"" while stationed in Newfoundland.

It was there he met his first wife, actress Ruby Johnston, whom he married in 1945.

Back home, Holbrook landed a steady acting gig on the daytime soap opera ""The Brighter Day"" and continued to perform his Twain show.

Ed Sullivan later caught a performance of it and invited Holbrook to appear on his variety show in 1956.

Holbrook's career on stage and screen was prodigious.

He made his Broadway debut in 1961 in ""Do You Know the Milky Way?"" and the Great White Way would become a familiar home for him as he appeared in numerous productions over the years, including ""Man of La Mancha,"" ""An American Daughter"" and -- of course -- ""Mark Twain Tonight.""

He broke ground on the small screen with the 1972 television movie ""That Certain Summer"" in which he played a divorced father who comes out as a gay man.

Holbrook appeared in various other TV productions, including the NBC miniseries ""Lincoln,"" which won him an Emmy in 1976, and the 1980s sitcom ""Designing Women,"" which starred his then-wife, Dixie Carter.

His marriage to his first wife ended in divorce in 1965. The following year, he married actress Carol Eve Rossen. They divorced in 1983, and in 1984 he married Carter and remained married to her until her death due to complications from endometrial cancer in 2010.

He found success in films as well.

In 1973's ""Magnum Force,"" Holbrook played corrupt police Lt. Briggs going up against Clint Eastwood's Inspector Harry Callahan. After Briggs dies when a bomb goes off in his moving car, Callahan famously uttered, ""A man's got to know his limitations.""

Holbrook's role as ""Deep Throat"" in the 1976 political film ""All the President's Men"" gave the public something to hang their hat on as the actual source who advised Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward (played by Robert Redford in the film) in what would become the Watergate scandal.

In 2008, his Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for his role as a retired widower in ""Into the Wild"" made the then 82-year-old Holbrook the oldest performer to ever be nominated in that category at the time.

But it was Twain who Holbrook returned to time and time again."
"5 children and a man are killed in a shooting in Muskogee, Oklahoma","(CNN) A shooting at a home in eastern Oklahoma has left five children and a man dead, and a woman hospitalized with serious injuries, police said Tuesday morning.

A suspect -- Jarron Deajon Pridgeon, 25 -- was taken into custody after someone called 911 about the shooting early Tuesday in Muskogee , police spokeswoman Lynn Hamlin said.

Police did not immediately release the names and ages of the victims or information about a motive.

But investigators believe the victims were a family and that the suspect lived with them, Hamlin said. She did not know whether the suspect was related to the victims, she said.

""It was not random ... because they all did live in this home together,"" Hamlin told reporters Tuesday. ""But as far as what all of those relationships look like, we just don't know that yet.""

Black people in history: Little-known figures to know,"Dorothy Height was often the only woman in the room. She made it her life’s work to change that, fighting battles against both sexism and racism to become, as President Obama called her, the “godmother” of the civil rights movement.

Height felt the sting of racism at an early age. She was accepted to New York’s Barnard College in 1929 but learned there wasn’t a spot for her because the school had already filled its quota of two Black students per year.

Instead she enrolled at NYU and earned a master’s in educational psychology. This led to a career as a social worker in New York and Washington, where she helped lead the YWCA and the United Christian Youth Movement.

In 1958, Height became president of the National Council of Negro Women, a position she held for more than 40 years. In that role she fought tirelessly for desegregation, affordable housing, criminal justice reform and other causes.

By the 1960s, Height had become one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s key advisers. Historians say that as an organizer of the March on Washington, she was the only woman activist on the speakers’ platform during King’s “I Have a Dream’’ speech.

Historians say her contributions to the civil rights movement were overlooked at the time because of her sex. But by the time of her death in 2010, Height had taken her place among the movement’s towering figures.

“She was truly a pioneer, and she must be remembered as one of those brave and courageous souls that never gave up,” Rep. John Lewis once said. “She was a feminist and a major spokesperson for the rights of women long before there was a women’s movement.”"
Three people are dead after an argument over snow shoveling leads to murder-suicide,"(CNN) Three people, including the shooter, are dead after a dispute over snow shoveling in Plains, Pennsylvania, outside Wilkes-Barre on Monday, Plains Township Police Chief Dale Binker told CNN on Tuesday.

At around 9 a.m. Monday, the shooter, Jeffrey Spaide, got into an argument with James and Lisa Goy, who lived across the street, while shoveling snow from his driveway, a release from the Luzerne County District Attorney's Office said.

The Goys were shoveling snow from their parking spots across the street onto Spaide's property, the release said. Spaide asked them to stop and the argument escalated quickly.

As they argued, the release says Spaide went into his house, retrieved a handgun, and came back outside firing multiple shots ""at close range"" at the Goys. He then went back into his house, pulled out an AR-style rifle, and fired at the injured Goys, ""executing them,"" Binker said.

Binker told CNN this was not the first disagreement between Spaide and the Goys over snow this year. Two months ago, another snowstorm also led to an altercation between them, he said, though police were not notified of that dispute and said Spaide was not known to police for any other matter.

Three Rochester police officers are removed from patrol after a 9-year-old girl is handcuffed and pepper-sprayed,"(CNN) Three Rochester, New York, officers have been removed from patrol duty after an incident in which a 9-year-old girl was handcuffed and pepper-sprayed, Interim Police Chief Cynthia Herriott-Sullivan said.

Body camera videos of Friday's encounter -- released by the police department over the weekend -- showed officers restraining the child, putting her in handcuffs and attempting to get her inside the back of a police vehicle as she repeatedly cries and calls for her father.

The officers were responding to what police called a report of ""family trouble"" in an encounter sharply criticized by city officials. The incident led to protests in the community.

Herriott-Sullivan said in a statement that the decision to remove the officers from patrol came in response to Mayor Lovely Warren's order that the three officers be immediately suspended.

One officer has been suspended, and two were placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation, according to the statement.

In two body camera videos, the officers are seen pepper-spraying the girl after she failed to follow commands to put her feet inside the car.

The girl was transported to Rochester General Hospital, where she was later released, according to police.

The officers involved were suspended Monday, city officials said. CNN has reached out to the police union for comment.

The incident has been compared to the disturbing death of Daniel Prude , a Black man who died in March after Rochester police pinned him to the ground and placed a hood over his head as he experienced a mental health crisis.

The police body camera footage of that incident, released in August after city officials intentionally delayed its release , led to protests over the police's treatment of Black people and those experiencing mental health crises. Mayor Lovely Warren later fired the police chief , saying there was a ""pervasive problem"" in the police department.

CNN has not been able to verify the race of the 9-year-old with authorities or family members.

At a news conference Sunday, Herriott-Sullivan said the treatment of the girl was not acceptable.

""I'm not going to stand here and tell you that for a 9-year-old to have to be pepper-sprayed is OK. It's not,"" she said. ""I don't see that as who we are as a department, and we're going to do the work we have to do to ensure that these kinds of things don't happen.""

Warren said the girl reminded her of her own young daughter.

On Monday, New York state Sen. Samra Brouk and Assemblyman Demond Meeks, both Democrats, introduced legislation that would prohibit police use of chemical agents against minors in the state, according to a statement.

""The harrowing experience endured by a nine-year-old girl in our community -- including being handcuffed and pepper sprayed -- should never happen to another child,"" Brouk said in a statement. ""This legislation will ensure that when a child is in crisis, they will never again be met with such violence in the form of pepper spray or other chemical irritants.""

Police called to a report of 'family trouble'

Officers were called to a home on the afternoon of January 29 for a report of ""family trouble,"" Rochester Deputy Police Chief Andre Anderson said Sunday.

The officers were told the girl was ""suicidal"" and that she had ""indicated that she wanted to kill herself and she wanted to kill her mom,"" the deputy chief explained.

The girl tried to flee from officers, Anderson said, and video released by police shows an officer chase her and attempt to provide assistance.

Afterward, he said, her mother arrived and the body camera video shows the two arguing. Anderson said officers then decided to remove the child from the situation and transport her to an area hospital.

But the girl refused to get inside a police vehicle, ""thrashed around,"" and kicked an officer, knocking his body camera around, according to Anderson.

""It didn't appear as if she was resisting the officers, she was trying not to be restrained to go to the hospital,"" Anderson said. ""As the officers made numerous attempts to try to get her in the car, an officer sprayed the young child with OC spray to get her in the car.""

The body camera video shows the girl repeatedly crying out for her father, while being physically restrained by officers. She is seen screaming before her head is held down against the snow-covered ground and is handcuffed. A struggle ensues between the girl and officers as they attempt to get her inside the back of a police vehicle.

At one point, one officer says, ""You're acting like a child.""

""I am a child!"" the girl responds.

Later in the video, a female officer is seen talking to the girl, eventually saying, ""This is your last chance, otherwise pepper spray's going in your eyeballs."" About a minute later, another officer can be heard saying, ""Just spray her at this point."" The female officer is seen shaking a can that appears to be pepper spray and the child continues to scream.

The officers involved in the incident were not identified by police, nor were the child or her mother.

Anderson said Sunday he was ""not making any excuses for what transpired"" and that the department is ""looking at a culture change."" The department is in the process of reviewing many policies and looking to make changes, according to Anderson.

Mayor Warren said she has directed the chief of police to conduct a complete and thorough investigation of the incident and said she welcomes the review of what happened by the city's police accountability board.

After Monday's officer suspensions, she said what happened was ""simply horrible.""

""Unfortunately, state law and union contract prevents me from taking more immediate and serious action,"" she said.

New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a tweet Monday that her office is looking into the incident as well. She called the incident ""deeply disturbing and wholly unacceptable.""

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in his state and across the nation, the relationship between police and community is ""clearly not working.""

""Rochester needs to reckon with a real police accountability problem, and this alarming incident demands a full investigation that sends a message this behavior won't be tolerated,"" he said."
Biden administration announces direct vaccine shipments to pharmacies,"(CNN) The Biden administration announced Tuesday it will begin direct shipments of coronavirus vaccines to retail pharmacies next week, expanding points of access for Americans to receive shots as concerns about variants of the virus expand.

""Millions of Americans turn to their local pharmacies every day for their medicines, flu shots, and much more. And pharmacies are readily accessible in most communities, with most Americans living within five miles of a pharmacy,"" White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said in a briefing.

The program, which will begin rolling out February 11, will start at about 6,500 stores that will receive a total of 1 million doses before eventually expanding, Zients said.

The administration also announced it is increasing the weekly allocation of vaccines going to states, tribes and territories by an additional 5%, bringing the weekly total of vaccines purchased per week a minimum of 10.5 million.

And Zients said the Federal Emergency Management Agency would fully reimburse states for the eligible services they have provided since the beginning of the pandemic in January 2020. The reimbursements will encompass personal protective equipment and the mobilization of the National Guard, Zients said, estimating the price tag will be between $3-5 billion.

Exclusive: Elizabeth Warren wants answers on Robinhood's ties to large hedge funds,"New York (CNN Business) Senator Elizabeth Warren is demanding answers from Robinhood co-CEO Vlad Tenev over potential conflicts of interest caused by the free trading app's relationship with large hedge funds and other financial players.

In a letter obtained by CNN Business, the Massachusetts Democrat called out Robinhood for ""abruptly changing the rules"" on individual investors last week by temporarily banning purchases ofand other stocks backed by traders on Reddit.

""The public deserves a clear accounting of Robinhood's relationships with large financial firms and the extent to which those relationships may be undermining its obligations to its customers,"" Warren wrote in the letter to Tenev.

The letter from Warren underscores the enormous scrutiny facing Robinhood from all sides, including lawmakers, regulators and customers.

During an interview with CNN on Sunday, Warren called for the SEC to investigate the entire GameStop saga. In her letter to Robinhood, copied to the SEC and FINRA, Wall Street's self-regulator, Warren specifically asks whether the startup was in violation of regulations or laws before or during the recent market volatility.

Robinhood has repeatedly said that its controversial trading restrictions were caused by surging financial requirements, not at the behest of Wall Street firms getting hurt by the rally in GameStop, AMC and other stocks popular among short-sellers.

""We didn't want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren't trying to help hedge funds,"" Robinhood said in an email to users Monday night.

Still, Warren said Robinhood's trading limits on small investors ""raises troubling concerns about its relationships with large financial institutions that execute its trades.""

Warren suggests 'conflicts of interest'

Specifically, she pointed to Robinhood's ties to Citadel Securities, a market maker owned by billionaire Ken Griffin. Like other brokerages, Robinhood gets paid to route orders to market makers, a controversial practice known as payment for orderflow. Citadel Securities is a major source of revenue for Robinhood.

Warren said that these developments raise ""further questions about potential conflicts of interest affecting Robinhood's business practices and relationships.""

She asked Robinhood to describe in detail its relationship with Citadel Securities and whether the startup held any talks with any Citadel business or affiliate before deciding to halt purchases of GameStop. Warren also asked Robinhood to explain what user data it shares with Citadel Securities and how much revenue it generates from its relationship with the market maker.

'You're the product'

The Griffin-run entities have denied any role in Robinhood's decision to stop purchases of GameStop.

""Citadel is not involved in, or responsible for, any retail brokers' decision to stop trading in any way,"" the hedge fund said in a statement last week.

Citadel Securities, the market maker, said it has not ""instructed or otherwise caused any brokerage firm to stop, suspend or limit trading or otherwise refuse to do business.""

The turmoil at Robinhood is drawing attention to the free-trading business model championed by the startup -- and its reliance on payment for orderflow.

""With anything that's free, you're the product,"" Mark Yusko, CEO of hedge fund Morgan Creek Capital Management, told CNN Business. ""With Facebook and Instagram, you're the product. With Robinhood, you're the product.""

Yusko said it's free to trade on Robinhood because the app is being paid to route those trades to Citadel Securities and other market makers.

""And guess what they're doing? They're front-running you,"" he said.

'We had no choice'

Robinhood has explained that its decision to impose trading restrictions last week was led by surging financial requirements caused by the market turmoil. Whenever investors buy stocks, brokerages like Robinhood must make a deposit first at a clearinghouse.

Robinhood said its deposit requirements spiked tenfold last week, in part due to the volatility in the suddenly popular stocks. Robinhood received a 3:30 am call Thursday morning from its clearinghouse requesting the company put up a staggering $3 billion, Tenev said. The startup eventually convinced the clearinghouse to lower the sum to $1.4 billion.

""We had no choice in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory requirements,"" Tenev told Tesla CEO Elon Musk during an interview on the platform Clubhouse explaining the controversial trading restrictions.

In a sign of the extreme financial pressure that Robinhood is under, the startup announced Monday it raised an additional $2.4 billion. That brings Robinhood's total fundraising in the past week to $3.4 billion -- far more than what the startup had previously raised.

Forced arbitration for angry customers?

The decision to restrict trading drew the ire of users who threatened to quit the platform.

""We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing,"" the startup said in an email to users Monday.

Some users have filed lawsuits against Robinhood , arguing the restrictions rigged the market against individual investors.

However, Warren said in her letter to Robinhood that she is troubled by the forced arbitration clauses in the startup's customer agreements that require customers to go through an arbitration forum instead of going to court.

Critics say forced arbitration can limit public disclosure of wrongdoing and make it harder for claimants to get a fair hearing. Several tech companies including Google and Facebook have in recent years ended forced arbitration for employee complaints.

""Investors harmed by Robinhood's trading restrictions should be able to argue their case in court,"" Warren wrote, ""rather than in closed-door proceedings that are too often rigged against claimants."""
Biden administration designates Myanmar military takeover as a coup,"Washington (CNN) The Biden administration has formally determined that the military takeover in Myanmar constitutes a coup d'état, a designation that requires the US to cut its foreign assistance to the country.

""After careful review of the facts and circumstances, we have assessed that Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's ruling party, and Win Myint, the duly elected head of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1,"" a State Department official said Tuesday, using another name for Myanmar. ""We continue to call on the Burmese military leadership to release them and all other detained civil society and political leaders immediately and unconditionally.""

The United States provides ""very little"" foreign assistance directly to Myanmar's government and ""the government of Burma, including the Burmese military, is already subject to a number of foreign assistance restrictions, including statutory restrictions on military assistance, due to its human rights record.""

The State Department official, speaking on a call with reporters, said the administration ""will undertake a broader review of our assistance programs to ensure they align with recent events.""

That review will begin ""immediately"" and will ""look at any programs that indirectly benefit the military or individual low level officers.""

"Captain Tom Moore, who raised millions for the NHS, dies aged 100","London (CNN) Tom Moore, the 100-year-old World War II veteran whose efforts to raise millions for the UK's National Health Service made him a universally adored icon during the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak, has died in hospital after himself contracting the disease, his family said Tuesday.

Known affectionately as Captain Tom, Moore raised almost £33 million ($45 million) by walking laps of his garden last year. His exploits united a country frozen in lockdown and made him an unlikely celebrity late in his life, earning him a military promotion, a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II and a number-one single.

Moore tested positive for the virus and was taken to a hospital on Sunday , suffering from breathing problems after being treated for pneumonia, his family said. They announced his death on Tuesday.

""It is with great sadness that we announce the death of our dear father, Captain Sir Tom Moore,"" the family said in a statement to PA Media.

""The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of,"" they added. ""Whilst he'd been in so many hearts for just a short time, he was an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay alive in our hearts forever.""

Buckingham Palace said the Queen was sending a private message of condolence to Moore's family, as numerous figures in British politics, culture, sport and society paid tribute to him.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""a hero in the truest sense of the word,"" and Moore's foundation, set up in the wake of his remarkable fundraising achievements, said it was ""heartbroken.""

A family joke that captivated the country

Moore's fundraising efforts will long be associated with the UK's plunge into lockdown last spring, and his death makes him one of the highest-profile victims of a virus that has claimed the lives of more than 100,000 Britons.

His campaign began as a family joke during his recovery from a broken hip, and he initially sought an unassuming target of £1,000 ($1,370) for his troubles. But within days, his slow but determined journeys around his backyard had attracted rounds of media attention.

Viewers would seek updates on Moore's progress each day, and his final steps were cheered by supporters around the world.

""I'm absolutely overwhelmed by this sum of money,"" Moore told CNN last year. ""We really never, ever for a minute thought we would get to this sort of money. We started off with a little modest figure.""

A birthday message for Moore was displayed on advertising boards in a deserted Piccadilly Circus in London on April 30 last year.

Millions of Britons have received the first dose of a cornavirus vaccine. Moore would have been among the first Brits offered the vaccine, given his age, but he was unable to have a shot because he was being treated for pneumonia, CNN affiliate ITV News reported Monday.

""Captain Sir Tom Moore was a hero in the truest sense of the word,"" Prime Minister Johnson said in a statement Tuesday. ""In the dark days of the Second World War he fought for freedom and in the face of this country's deepest post war crisis he united us all, he cheered us all up, and he embodied the triumph of the human spirit.""

""He became not just a national inspiration but a beacon of hope for the world,"" Johnson said, calling his fundraising ""astonishing.""

Labour leader Keir Starmer added that Moore ""put others first at a time of national crisis and was a beacon of hope for millions,"" adding: ""Britain has lost a hero.""

""Whilst we mourn his loss, we celebrate his life and will be forever grateful for his optimistic philosophy and wonderful spirit,"" Moore's foundation said. ""Because of you tomorrow will be a good day for so many more.""

Moore tested positive for Covid-19 on January 22 after returning home from hospital where he had been diagnosed with pneumonia, his family told PA Media. He went back into hospital on Sunday after needing help with his breathing, his family added.

""Tom was able to have visitors to say goodbye to him at the end of his life. Yesterday evening his daughter Hannah and grandchildren Benjie and Georgia were able to be by his side and his daughter Lucy was able to speak to him on FaceTime.""

'Beyond my wildest expectations'

Long before his fundraising earned him international attention, Moore climbed to the rank of Captain during his service in the British Army's World War II campaigns in Burma (now Myanmar) and India.

Nicknamed ""Tommy"" by fellow troops, Moore held a number of different roles during the conflict, including tank commander, and at one point survived a bout of dengue fever.

""I'd already accepted that this was how it would be, but seeing it written down in black and white was quite a defining moment,"" Moore wrote in his autobiography, describing the moment he was conscripted at the age of 20. ""In truth, I was rather looking forward to the idea of being in uniform, travelling and having different kinds of experiences.""

Captain Tom Moore served in Burma and India during World War II.

Having initially trained as a civil engineer, Moore became the managing director of a concrete manufacturer after the war ended.

Following the death of his wife in 2006, he moved in with his daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren in Bedfordshire, eastern England.

Asked why he believed his fundraiser had struck a chord with so many people, Moore told CNN: ""I think because our National Health Service is good... I had a broken hip and I had cancer and they treated me magnificently.

""I think people realize that... everyone, wherever they are, gets equally treated, just as well, with the same efficiency and kindness that we get from our nurses and doctors -- who, after all, at the moment are on the firing line (of the coronavirus crisis).""

""It has gone far beyond my wildest expectations,"" he added in his autobiography. ""I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart.""

The Queen is sending a private message of condolence to the family of Captain Sir Tom Moore.

Soldiers from the 1st Battalion Yorkshire Regiment gave Moore a guard of honor as he completed his final lap in mid-April. Later that month, on his 100th birthday, he was promoted to Honorary Colonel in the British Army, in recognition of his fundraising achievements, and in July the Queen knighted Moore in her first public duty since the pandemic began.

""If I kneel down I'll never get up again,"" Moore joked as he left his home for Windsor Castle at the time.

The Queen was one of many Brits expressing sadness at Moore's passing on Tuesday. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the country's most senior bishop, said that Moore ""was the very best of us... where he walked, a nation followed.""

The Royal British Legion, an armed forces charity, added: ""He epitomised the spirit of our wartime generation and was an inspiration to millions, bringing us all together in the most challenging of times."""

ExxonMobil reports its first annual loss since its merger,"New York (CNN Business) ExxonMobil lost $22.4 billion in 2020, its first annual loss since the 1999 merger that created the nation's largest oil company.

It's the latest company to report its worst year on record during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The fossil fuel industry has suffered from a plunge in oil prices as stay-at-home orders around both the nation and the world caused the biggest drop in oil use on record -- and oil producers in Russia and Saudi Arabia simultaneously flooded the world with excess supply in a production dispute that lasted for months.

In April, oil prices were trading on global markets at a negative price , as oil producers and traders were having to pay to store all of the excess oil rather than being able to sell it.

Annual revenue at ExxonMobil plunged $83.4 billion, or 31.5%, to $181.5 billion.

""The past year presented the most challenging market conditions ExxonMobil has ever experienced,"" CEO Darren Woods said on a conference call.

The company has taken cost-cutting and reorganization steps that will help Exxon be in better shape going forward, Woods said. Those moves are expected to save the oil giant $6 billion per year by 2023, compared to before the pandemic. It also slashed capital spending to $21.4 billion, which is 35% lower than initially planned for the year.

Exxon said it should be able to keep paying a dividend to investors, as it did throughout 2020 -- a time when other companies discontinued their dividends due to mounting losses.

Digging into the results -- and effect of writedowns

The company's $22.4 billion net loss was largely the result of writedowns in the value of its assets . Even excluding those writedowns, Exxon would have lost $1.4 billion for the year, compared to a profit of $9.6 billion on that basis in 2019.

Excluding special items, the company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $20.1 billion. But that was greatly due to the writedowns.

Exxon reported an adjusted income of $110 million excluding special items, a fraction of the $1.8 billion it made a year-earlier, but still the first profitable quarter it recorded for the year.

ExxonMobil XOM The fourth-quarter results were slightly better than forecast andshares were up nearly 4% in midday trading.

Exxon's stock had fallen 41% over the course of 2020, but shares have rebounded about 9% so far this year on hopes for a recovery in the global economy and a rise in oil prices after OPEC and Russia agreed to continue to limit production . Analysts are forecasting that ExxonMobil should stay profitable in every quarter of 2021, and into the foreseeable future.

Chevron CVX The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that there had been discussions between ExxonMobil and, the nation's No. 2 oil company, about a possible merger. Woods said while the company continues to consider merger and acquisition opportunities, he declined to comment on the report during the company's conference call Tuesday.

Exxon also announced it would name a new board member -- Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, the former CEO of the Malaysian oil company Petronas. It said it is also talking to other potential new board members.

But the company is facing a proxy fight by an activist investor group , Engine No. 1, which last week nominated four candidates for the board. Engine No. 1 argues that ExxonMobil is not making the necessary adjustments to respond to the changing long-term outlook for the global energy industry.



The industry faces challenges around the world to cut carbon emissions in order to combat climate change. The United States rejoined the ""A board that has underperformed this dramatically and defied shareholder sentiment for this long has not earned the right to choose its own new members or pack itself in the face of calls for change,"" said a statement from Engine No. 1 on Tuesday. ""For years ExxonMobil has pursued spending and strategic plans that position it to succeed only in the absence of a material long-term energy demand shift, and it remains positioned for continued value destruction for decades to come under alternate scenarios.""The industry faces challenges around the world to cut carbon emissions in order to combat climate change. The United States rejoined the Paris climate accord on President Joe Biden's first day in office. He also has halted new oil and gas leases on federal lands.

In response to the pressure to reduce carbon, ExxonMobil announced Monday that it had created a new business to commercialize its technology to pull carbon out of the atmosphere, and that it would invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025.

""Carbon capture storage is a critical element to achieving the ambitions of the Paris agreement,"" said Woods.

ExxonMobil captured 120 million tons of carbon last year, which Woods said is equivalent to taking more than 25 million passenger vehicles off the road. But Engine No. 1 said counting on carbon capture is the wrong approach for the company's long-term outlook, and that it should instead make more significant investments in clean energy in order to profitably diversify.

""It is ... poor long-term planning to rely almost exclusively on the idea that carbon capture will become scalable and affordable soon enough to allow for continued oil and gas production growth for decades to come under a Paris-compliant trajectory,"" the group said."
"Angelina Jolie is selling Winston Churchill's only wartime painting, gifted to her by Brad Pitt","By Rob Picheta Chloe Melas , CNN Written by

Angelina Jolie is selling the only painting created by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during World War II , with the work expected to fetch up to £2.5 million ($3.4 million) at auction.

Churchill painted ""Tower of the Koutoubia Mosque"" in Marrakech, Morocco, after attending the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, and gave it to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Actor Brad Pitt bought the painting in 2011 from high-end antique dealer M.S. Rau for Jolie, according to a source with knowledge of the sale. The couple separated in 2016 after two years of marriage and their divorce is still ongoing.

Representatives for Pitt and Jolie did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

Churchill originally created the painting shortly after the wartime summit, during which he and Roosevelt formulated the next stage of their strategy to defeat Nazi Germany.

It ultimately found its way into Jolie's own collection of artworks, and will be sold this year. The estimate on price ranges from £1.5 million to £2.5 million ($2 million to $3.4 million).

""It is the only work that Churchill painted during the war, perhaps encouraged by the recent progress made by the Allies in what he considered to be one of the most beautiful countries he had encountered,"" Nick Orchard, head of modern British art at auction house Christie's, said in a statement.

The painting was made after the two leaders agreed to only accept an ""unconditional surrender"" from the Axis powers, a strategically significant statement of intent from the two wartime figures.

It is being offered by the Jolie Family Collection, Christie's said.

Antiques dealer Bill Rau, who owned the painting previously, told CNN the painting was gifted to President Roosevelt's son, who then sold the piece to a filmmaker in the 1960s. According to Rau, the painting ended up in New Orleans, where it was kept in a local family's closet for over 50 years before the step-daughter of the family inherited the work and contacted his gallery, M.S. Rau.

""The painting depicts the very moment the two world leaders shared as they viewed the majestic landscape of Marrakech as the sun set over the Atlas Mountains, and to know Churchill gifted the painting to FDR after their time together excited me even more,"" Rau told CNN.

Though Churchill painted several scenes in Morocco before the war began, this is the only known work he made between 1939 and 1945.

""'Tower of the Koutoubia Mosque' is therefore arguably the best painting by Winston Churchill due to the significance of the subject matter to him, and the fact that it highlights the importance of the friendship between the two leaders,"" Orchard said.

""The gifting of the work to Roosevelt underlines the fact that Churchill held the American President in such high regard and points to their joint efforts in guiding the Allied powers to the outcome of the Second World War.""

Patrick McCaughey, who was charged with assaulting a police officer seen on video getting crushed by a door and screaming in pain, was reported to the FBI by someone who knew him from childhood, according to court documents. McCaughey's attorney declined to comment.

Andrew Ericson, a 23-year-old man from Oklahoma, was charged with two misdemeanors related to the riot after an acquaintance reported his social media livestream to authorities, court documents show . Ericson's attorney declined to comment.

Matthew Mazzocco was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds without lawful entry and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol Grounds after a tipster told federal agents Mazzocco posted pictures at the Capitol on a Facebook youth sports page, court documents show . CNN reached out to Mazzocco and his attorney but has not heard back.

After a public call for help, the FBI has now received more than 200,000 digital tips from the public, Steven D'Antuono, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington, DC, Field Office, said late January.

""Some of you have recognized that this was such an egregious incident that you have turned in your own friends and family members,"" D'Antuono said . ""We know that those decisions are often painful -- but you picked up the phone because it was the right thing to do.""

At least 150 people have been charged by federal prosecutors in connection with the insurrection. Court documents show at least two dozen of those cases involved tips to the FBI from familiar faces: former romantic partners, old classmates, social media followers, siblings, neighbors, some who said they had noticed a pattern of concerning behaviors before January 6.

While the tipsters' motivations are unknown, Nathaniel Herr, an associate psychology professor at American University in Washington, DC, said it's likely many felt obliged to do something after the authorities' call for assistance.

""When the FBI is making a call, it feels like, 'Here's a legitimate place that I can finally report this thing that's been bothering me for a long time,'"" Herr told CNN. ""I would bet, in many of the reporters' experience, it was something that had been brewing for a while and now it was like, 'OK, someone's asking me for help.'""

'Choose a side or die'

Among those who turned to authorities is 18-year-old Jackson Reffitt, who reported his own father. Guy Reffitt, of Texas, was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and obstruction of justice. Investigators tracked his cell phone location and identified him in photographs taken at the Capitol, according to an affidavit. CNN reached out to Guy Reffitt and his attorney but has not heard back.

Jackson Reffitt told authorities he had heard his father admit he went to the US Capitol to ""protect the country"" and that he brought his gun with him. According to the affidavit, he said Guy Reffitt told them the FBI was now watching him. The son also told investigators his father said he would do ""what he had to do"" if Jackson Reffitt reported him to authorities, the affidavit states.

""He said, 'Choose a side or die,'"" Jackson Reffitt told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""And if I chose a certain side, I would cross a line and he would do something he didn't want to do.""

Guy Reffitt also threatened his daughter, telling her that if she put his comments on social media, he would ""put a bullet"" through her phone, the affidavit said, citing what Jackson Reffitt told investigators. According to the document, Guy Reffitt's spouse did not believe he would act on his words.

Nicole Reffitt, Guy Reffitt's wife, told CNN in a statement she stands with her family and called Reffitt a ""loving husband devoted father, loyal friend and passionate patriot.""

""Many statements have been taken out of context,"" Nicole Reffitt said in the statement. ""I want it to be clear that no one present during the conversation in question ever felt that they were in any danger or felt like they were being threatened. We have texts that prove this.""

Some were annoyed, she said, ""but they never ever feared for their safety.""

""Our home has always been an open door for people who need a warm bed, peace or a simple hug. Our home welcomes all people of all colors, faiths beliefs and opinions,"" her statement said. ""Guy in particular listens to everyone and tries to understand all sides.""

Sarah Reffitt, Guy Reffitt's 23-year-old daughter, told CNN her father ""would never harm or hurt anybody,"" and added she feels ""betrayed"" by Jackson Reffitt's statements.

""My dad is a good man who always would help another in need no matter their political stance, religion or ethnicity,"" she said.

""I feel disappointed in him for making that decision even at all to go up there and risk his life and endanger others and put his family in this situation,"" Jackson Reffitt told Cuomo. ""It might be my fault for talking to authorities but I don't want to think that. He's an adult and he made his own decisions.""

Another tip to the FBI came from Larry Brock's ex-wife, according to an affidavit. Brock, a retired Air Force Reserve officer, walked into the Capitol wearing a green helmet, green tactical vest with patches, black and camouflage jacket and beige pants and holding a white flex cuff, usually used by law enforcement to detain subjects, according to a news release from the Department of Justice.

His ex-wife told the FBI she recognized him in a picture.

""I just know that when I saw this was happening I was afraid he would be there,"" she told authorities, according to the affidavit. ""I think you already know he was there. It is such a good picture of him and I recognize his patch.""

Brock has been charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. CNN has reached out to Brock and his attorney but has not heard back.

For some, a gradual change

For some tipsters, the riots were the culmination of a bewildering descent, propelled by conspiracy theories and radicalization on social media.

But flagging concerning behaviors of a family member or friend isn't easy, experts say, especially when many are unsure if those activities will lead to violence.

""In the aftermath of all these international terrorism cases that we would see, even people in the US, time and time again the family members, the friends would say the same thing: 'I saw something that seemed out of the ordinary, but I didn't know what it meant or didn't know what it was and I didn't really want to confront that person,'"" said Javed Ali, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council and visiting instructor at the University of Michigan. ""I think you're seeing the same phenomena play out here.""

Jackson Reffitt said that for the past four years, he watched as his father ""snowballed,"" becoming more active online, more involved with groups including ""far right extremists.""

According to the affidavit , someone with the name Guy Reffitt previously posted a comment on a ""Texas Freedom Force"" website, which investigators said is a ""militia extremist group.""

""He's been a lot more, I don't want to say aggressive, but a lot more scared,"" Jackson Reffitt said.

""He would never say the stuff he did to me a couple of years ago... not once would he even think about something like that,"" he added.

Similar stories are sprinkled across federal authorities' allegations.

One witness told investigators that Kevin Strong, of California, who is charged with three crimes in connection to the riots, had been showing signs of ""behavioral changes over the last few months, including stockpiling items"" and telling people to prepare for martial law and hanging a flag with a Qanon-affiliated slogan on his house, an affidavit said. The witness also said Strong had sent messages to someone else claiming ""World War 3 is going to occur on January 6.""

CNN reached out to Strong and his attorney but has not heard back.

""As someone who used to look at this phenomenon of radicalization more on the international terrorism side, and looking at how people were similarly radicalized or mobilized to violence just like what happened on the sixth, from the al Qaeda ideology and the ISIS ideology, there are a lot of parallels to that world,"" Ali said.

The fact that there were so many reports to the FBI about loved ones shows, he added, that people's ""antenna was up"" and they saw things that ""in retrospect made them think twice about the person who they ultimately turned in."""
Hedge funds are getting crushed by the worst short squeeze in a quarter century,"New York (CNN Business) Hedge funds that bet against GameStop and other stocks have been crushed by the Reddit army -- and they're infecting the rest of Wall Street.

The most heavily shorted stocks have nearly doubled in value over the last three months, according to Goldman Sachs. Those staggering gains created distress for short-sellers , setting off a negative spiral in the broader markets.

"If your loved one is hesitant to get the Covid-19 vaccine, share this","(CNN) Your loved ones are right to have questions about the Covid-19 vaccine -- the American public hasn't watched vaccine development this closely since Dr. Jonas Salk discovered how to immunize kids from polio in the '50s.

But vaccine hesitancy could put a dangerous damper on the country's response. Pockets of some populations most at risk of severe sickness from Covid-19, including young nurses and Black Americans , are still dubious of the vaccine -- because of the speed at which it was developed, its contents and potential side effects.

To answer questions your family and friends may have about the Covid-19 vaccine, we consulted with two experts:

Medical experts, successful clinical trials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have repeatedly assured us of the safety and effectiveness of the two Covid-19 vaccines available now, from Moderna and Pfizer.

But health experts take your concerns seriously, too, said Schaffner.

""We have to regard everybody's hesitation and skepticism seriously,"" he said. ""This is a new virus in the human population, new vaccines using new technologies, so you understand that people are somewhat hesitant.""

If they say:

""I don't know what's in the vaccine.""

You can say: That's fair. Vaccine ingredient lists include a lot of lengthy names only a chemist would recognize.

Here are the some of the main ingredients in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines , the two vaccines currently authorized for use, and how they work:

mRNA: Short for messenger ribonucleic acid, Short for messenger ribonucleic acid, mRNA is a ""genetic software"" that tells cells how to make the coronavirus spike protein, the structure the virus uses to invade cells. The mRNA gets your immune system's attention, so it's prepared to attack the spike protein if infection occurs. The mRNA disintegrates as soon as it relays its message, Schaffner said, and you excrete its remnants.

Fatty lipids: The mRNA is very fragile, so it's coated in a fatty lipid to protect it. The lipids, a buttery substance, can melt at room temperature -- which is why both vaccines must be kept at extremely cold temperatures. Fatty lipids used in Covid-19 vaccines include polyethylene glycol-2000 and cholesterol, among others.

Salts and sugars: Salts such as potassium chloride and sodium chloride are in the vaccine to balance the acidity in your body, according to the : Salts such as potassium chloride and sodium chloride are in the vaccine to balance the acidity in your body, according to the MIT Technology Review . Sugar, listed as sucrose, is there so the vaccine nanoparticles keep their shape.

Other vaccines still in trials in the US, such as AstraZeneca's, rely on different technologies than mRNA and, therefore, have different ingredients.

Moderna and Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccines must be kept at extremely cold temperatures to keep the vaccine's fatty lipids from melting.

If they say:

""The vaccine was created too quickly to be trustworthy.""

You can say: It's true that the Covid-19 vaccines currently authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration were developed and tested more quickly than other vaccines we're familiar with. But extensive clinical trials have proven their effectiveness.

Part of the reason why the vaccines were developed rapidly is because the circumstances called for speed: We're in a pandemic that's killed more than 2 million people worldwide and sickened over 103 million people. The need for a vaccine is urgent.

So rather than wait for the results of trials to manufacture a vaccine, the companies creating these vaccines produced them simultaneously so they'd be ready to deploy when the trials were completed, Schaffner said. Typically, the companies that create vaccines would wait for a trial to end before giving the OK to manufacture the vaccines.

""Of course, our 'bet,' if you will, came up a winner,"" Schaffner said. Both Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines are 94% to 95% effective at preventing severe sickness from Covid-19.

The technology the vaccines use, mRNA, was developed long before the virus that causes Covid-19 began to circulate in humans, so the tech can be trusted, Schaffner and Karron said.

The Covid-19 vaccine trials included tens of thousands of participants, Karron said, whose reactions to the vaccine were closely monitored for months before the vaccines were approved by the FDA.

Vaccine developers also had the resources to speed up the process -- there were no questions of demand or funding, Karron said.

If they say:

""The vaccine could give me Covid-19.""

You can say: The vaccine cannot give you Covid-19, Schaffner said, because it doesn't contain the virus. It contains mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid, which tells your cells how to create the protein spike the virus uses to infect other cells.

The live virus never enters your body in the vaccination process, Karron said -- your cells learn how to make a part of the virus, but coronavirus can't replicate that way.

You may experience some ""intense but brief"" symptoms like fatigue, nausea and a low fever after you're vaccinated, she said. Those are often synonymous with Covid-19, but these vaccine-induced side effects should subside within 24 to 48 hours, she said.

It's also possible you could suffer no side effects, Karron said, or they could be as mild as a headache and a sore arm. In any case, you won't get Covid-19 from getting vaccinated.

Covid-19 vaccine studies, like this one in Florida, have proven their effectiveness in preventing severe illness.

If they say:

""The vaccine could alter my DNA.""

You can say: The Covid-19 vaccines do not alter or interact with your DNA.

The mRNA never enters a cell's nucleus, which houses DNA, Karron said. It does its work in the cytoplasm, the fluid within a cell.

The mRNA doesn't stick around in the body, either. It dissolves once it's sent a message to cells and exits your body, Schaffner said.

If they say:

""The vaccine could give my child autism or a birth defect.""

You can say: This is not true. Several studies have repeatedly shown that vaccines do not cause autism or development issues in young children. That belief is based on a : This is not true. Several studies have repeatedly shown that vaccines do not cause autism or development issues in young children. That belief is based on a bunk study from the 1990s that has since been retracted.

As stated above, the Covid-19 vaccine does not interfere with DNA.

If they're worried about the risk of getting vaccinated while pregnant, this may assuage their fears: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended the Covid-19 vaccine for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

It's also wise to get vaccinated, Schaffner said, because pregnant women are thought to be at a higher risk of severe illness from Covid-19. Compared to symptomatic people who are not pregnant, pregnant people are at a higher risk of ICU admission, the need for a ventilator and death, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

The risk of severe side effects after getting a Covid-19 vaccine is low, though people with severe allergies should consult with their doctor before getting vaccinated.

If they say:

""The vaccine's side effects could be severe.""

You can say: It's unlikely that you'll have a severe reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine. It's much more likely that you'll have a ""local reaction,"" such as redness and soreness in your arm or a low fever, Schaffner said.

Side effects of the vaccine tend to be more severe after the second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, Karron said, so it's smart to plan around that. You may want to take a day off work after you get the vaccine in case you're too fatigued. The symptoms tend to be more severe in young people than older folks who get vaccinated, she said.

""It's a small price to pay to prevent Covid,"" Karron said.

If they say:

""I could have an allergic reaction to the vaccine.""

You can say: This is possible, but very rare: About 11 cases per one million cases of Covid-19 vaccinations resulted in an allergic reaction, Karron said.

People with severe allergies or those who carry an EpiPen should consult with their doctor before they get vaccinated, she said, but even those with allergies have gotten the vaccine without a reaction."
Meet the 'vaccine hunters',"A version of this story appeared in the February 2 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday

(CNN) If she'd waited to get vaccinated until it was her ""tier's"" turn, Isabela Medina wouldn't have gotten the Covid-19 vaccine until late summer.

Medina, a healthy 25-year-old, moved across the United States to live with her parents on the East Coast after her work in the film industry dried up. Anxious to return to work safely, she decided in mid-January to go ""vaccine dumpster diving.""

Rather than dig through a hospital's garbage for vials, Medina staked out a grocery store pharmacy. She wanted to score a leftover vaccine.

She and a friend arrived in the early afternoon, prepared to wait. A line formed behind them. Hours later, when the day's appointments were done, pharmacy staff offered up eight leftover vaccines. Medina and her friend gleefully claimed two of them, Scottie Andrew and Alisha Ebrahimji report

""Vaccine hunters"" like Medina are a byproduct of a chaotic vaccination rollout in the US, defined by supply shortages, sluggish distribution and discarded doses.

President Joe Biden has unveiled a detailed plan to improve the rollout, aiming to administer ""100 million vaccines in 100 days."" But some health officials believe that target is too modest as new, more transmissible Covid-19 variants spread across America.

Speaking at a White House Covid briefing on Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci , chief medical adviser to the President, said that the best way to fight the new variants is to get people vaccinated ""as quickly and expeditiously as possible throughout the country.""

At the current pace of 1.3 million doses per day the country will reach about 75% of the population by summer 2021. Fauci has said the US Covid-19 vaccine distribution will ""get better very quickly"" as the Biden administration rolls out a series of measures aimed at ramping up inoculation.

But Medina's story underlines another problem with the rollout that may be more challenging to solve: Inequality. To vaccine hunt is to devote hours, possibly days, waiting for a shot -- a luxury many people, like those working at the grocery store pharmacy Medina staked out, don't have. Nearly 40% of grocery store workers are Black, Latino or Asian, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That same population is much more likely to die from contracting Covid-19 and are also being vaccinated at a much lower rate than White Americans

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.

Q: What do we know about the coronavirus variants?

A: Scientists are not surprised to see the coronavirus changing and evolving -- it's what viruses do, after all. And with so much unchecked spread across the US and other parts of the world, the virus is getting plenty of opportunity to do just that.

What scientists most fear is that a coronavirus variant will mutate to the point that it causes more severe disease, bypasses the ability of tests to detect it or evades the protection provided by vaccination. On Monday, Fauci warned that there would be a ""very high rate"" of re-infection if one of the new variants became dominant in the US.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

The pandemic is still dwarfing the size of Washington's efforts to fight it

The long war against Covid-19, ever more daunting in the dispiriting months of winter, is now posing a fundamental question over whether the US has the political, economic and national will to prevail before the disaster gets much worse, Stephen Collinson writes

A race against time to vaccinate sufficient Americans before variants of the virus cause a new wave of sickness and death is turning into a critical stress test for a mass immunization effort that got off to a difficult start. And there is a disconnect in Washington over the scale of the crisis, with Democrats demanding a ""go big"" economic rescue plan and the few Republicans who back action envisaging a much more modest approach.

In a glimmer of hope on the economic fight, Biden spent two hours on Monday in the Oval Office with a group of Republican senators who have offered a counter-proposal less than one-third the size of his $1.9 trillion rescue package. Congressional Democrats, far less concerned than Biden about a bipartisan approach, say the GOP plan is far too small.

Tokyo Olympics will go ahead despite pandemic

The Olympic Games will be held in 2021 ""no matter how the Covid situation will be,"" the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee President Yoshiro Mori said Tuesday, as Japan battles rising Covid-19 cases.

Questions have persisted over the country's readiness to host the Olympics, which are scheduled to be held from July 23 to August 8, as the pandemic rages on. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told Japan's Parliament Tuesday that he plans to extend a state of emergency -- which is set to expire Sunday -- until March 7 for Tokyo, Osaka and eight other prefectures.

Under the state of emergency, companies must facilitate work from home where possible, and restaurants are required to close by 8 p.m. The number of attendees at sports and entertainment events in Japan are also limited.

How Brazil's vaccine plan fell apart

Monica Aparecida Calazans, a nurse in São Paulo, risks her life every day to fight a pandemic that Brazil is nowhere close to getting under control. Yet, in a way, she's lucky. In mid-January, she was the very first Brazilian to receive a vaccine, no small feat in a country where the vaccine rollout has been nothing short of disastrous.

As of Sunday, only 0.5% percent of the country had received a first dose of either the AstraZeneca or Sinovac vaccines. Not a single person in Brazil has been fully vaccinated apart from some who took part in vaccine clinical trials.

The country's massive national healthcare system has a long history of successfully vaccinating its people. But multiple experts say the ineptitude of the federal government, led by Covid-skeptic President Jair Bolsonaro, has sabotaged its coronavirus response. They point to a distinct lack of urgency on the part of the federal government to secure supplies and a lack of diversification in vaccine supply, Matt Rivers and Marcia Reverdosa report

Tens of millions of Americans collected unemployment benefits for at least some period of time last year due to the pandemic's hit on the economy. After the stress of losing a job and figuring out how much the unemployment check would cover, the chances are good that taxes aren't top of too many people's minds. Nevertheless, unemployment compensation is treated as taxable income both by the IRS and by most states.

The preliminary findings were published in The Lancet on Tuesday and are based on data gathered from 19,866 participants, of which around three-quarters (14,964) received two doses of the vaccine and a quarter (4,902) were given a placebo.

Sixteen cases of symptomatic Covid-19 were confirmed in the vaccine group 21 days after participants received the first vaccine dose. Sixty two cases were found in the placebo group -- equating to an efficacy of 91.6%.

The trial included 2,144 people over the age of 60 and a sub-analysis conducted on this group revealed the vaccine was well tolerated and had a similar efficacy of 91.8%.

The team also analyzed the efficacy of the vaccine against severe and moderate Covid-19 disease and 21 days after the first dose no severe or moderate cases were reported in the vaccinated group, while 20 were reported in the placebo group.

"Tokyo Olympics will go ahead despite pandemic, Games chief says","Izakayas in Tokyo, Japan are closed after adhering to a government request to cease business at 8 p.m. Carl Court/Getty Images

Japan plans to extend its state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka and eight other prefectures as the country continues to battle rising Covid-19 cases, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Tuesday.

The move comes as questions persist over the country's readiness to host the Olympics, which are scheduled to be held in Tokyo this summer from July 23 to August 8.

Eleven of Japan's 47 prefectures are currently under a state of emergency that orders companies to facilitate work from home where possible, and requires restaurants to close by 8 p.m. Sports and entertainment events in Japan are also required to limit the number of attendees.

Suga told Japan's Parliament Tuesday that he plans to extend the state of emergency -- which is set to expire Sunday -- until March 7 for 10 of the prefectures. The state of emergency is set to be lifted for one prefecture, he said.

That decision still needs to be finalized by the government's coronavirus task force, and Suga is expected to hold a news conference Tuesday night over the state of emergency rules.

Rising cases: Japan's Health Ministry on Monday reported 1,792 new coronavirus infections and 72 additional deaths, bringing the country's total cases to more than 392,000 and more than 5,800 dead. Almost 50,000 Covid-19 patients are in need of hospital-level medical care as of Monday.

Around one third of confirmed cases are in the capital Tokyo, which on Monday reported fewer than 500 new cases for the first time since December 28.

Judge grants Minneapolis teachers temporary restraining order halting in-person teaching for some,"(CNN) A weekend temporary order allowed some Minneapolis Public School District (MPS) teachers and staff to not return to in-person work Monday due to Covid-19 concerns, according to court documents..

MPS staff were expected to return to in-person teaching Monday, but a ruling from Hennepin County District Court Judge Susan Robiner said that staff and teachers who had accommodations to work from home or were in the process of applying for them did not have to return with the rest of the staff, according to the order obtained by CNN affiliate WCCO.

The ruling came after the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers and Education Support Professionals (MFT) accused the school district of denying accommodations for teachers and staff who were either at high risk of contracting Covid-19 or were caring for a household member who was at risk of getting the virus, according to the documents.

""The risk of contracting a serious illness which has killed almost a half-million persons in the United States is axiomatically a profound harm,"" Judge Robiner wrote in her ruling.

Nintendo keeps blowing past its own sales goals. But it needs more hit games,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Nintendo keeps having one blowout quarter after another. But analysts say it's going to need new games and hardware to keep that momentum going.

On Monday, the Japanese gaming company reported 229.7 billion yen ($2.2 billion) in operating profit for the quarter ended December, topping analyst expectations. Sales of its Switch console reached a record high of 11.6 million units during the all-important holiday season.

The runaway success of the Switch prompted the company to raise itssales and earnings forecasts for the second time since November. It now expects a 24% jump in profit from what it projected just three months ago, with 560 billion yen ($5.3 billion) estimated for the year ending in March.

The results show that even many months into the pandemic, people are still turning to the Switch in droves. Nintendo previously projected that it would sell 19 million units of the console for the year ending in March. It now expects to sell 26.5 million after several upward revisions to the forecast.

Nintendo has been a huge winner of the pandemic-hit economy as more people continue to snap up its games and devices to help them stay entertained at home. Last year, the company's profits soared, sometimes at margins higher than 400%

One major success for the company has been the continued popularity of ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons."" The game, which is set on a relaxing virtual island utopia and allows users to fish, catch bugs and play with friends on the beach, runs on the Switch and has become a best-seller.

Nintendo sold 19.4 million copies of the game in the last nine months of 2020, bringing total sales to about 31.2 million units.

But the company has also been dogged by concerns of how long it can keep its hot streak going, particularly as the world starts to look past the pandemic.

Currently, analysts remain cautiously optimistic.

On Monday, Atul Goyal, an equity analyst at Jefferies, recommended that investors ""buy, but stay nimble.""

""We expected this beat,"" he wrote in a research note reacting to earnings.

But in order to continue its successful performance, the company ""will need a strong game pipeline and a hardware refresh,"" he added.

The company plans to release several new titles for the Switch this year, including ""Super Mario 3D World"" and ""Bowser's Fury.""

But ""there is no denying the title line-up for [the upcoming fiscal year] seems lacking,"" said Takao Suzuki, an analyst at Daiwa Securities in Japan. ""And investors are still closely watching the impact on earnings from a potential change in consumer behavior in the wake of the development and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.""

Nintendo should also work to build its brand ""in business areas other than games,"" such as mobile apps or theme parks, he told CNN Business.

The company has not teased new hardware, though some analysts suggest that could change later this year.

For now, Nintendo ""lacks an earnings growth story,"" wrote Goyal. ""We would have liked to see Nintendo start building a [broader] strategy, but that remains a dream."""
Are we getting weirder? Perhaps we're simply becoming ourselves,"(CNN) Normally reserved and conservatively dressed, my friend was outfitted in a strange mishmash of colorful wigs and Hawaiian shirts and a sequined gown. Her boyfriend was equally festively donned for New Year's Eve.

There may have even been multiple alcoholic beverages in her hands. I wasn't sure how it was possible to wear all of those things at once. More importantly, what had the universe done with my khaki-inclined friend who gravitated toward yoga and crudités?

When I looked beyond my friend's metamorphosis into this unfamiliar and strange being over the past year, I realized it wasn't just her. I didn't have to look far to witness weirdness lurking at every turn.

""The pandemic has made me a little bizarre,"" said Mika Mooney, 38, a lawyer who lives in Long Island with her husband and three kids. ""I now do everything by candlelight. I work with a candle lit, exercise, watch TV. My husband is scared I'm going to burn the house down!""

""Earlier today, I overheard a young woman holding the most beautiful blueberry muffin I've ever seen singing, 'ooh ooh blueberry muffin! I'm gonna eat you, blueberry muffin!'"" said Noah Michelson, 40, a New York-based editorial director, via email. ""At a different point in my life, I would have mocked her but now I feel like we'd be really good friends.""

Whether it's a newfound disdain for modern appliances or a kindred connection with songs about baked goods, people's eccentricities seem to be leaking out of our pores. Is it possible that our brains have moved from panic to boredom to just plain weirdness the past 10 months since Covid-19 upended our normal lives?

Daring to be ourselves

We might stare if you walk your cat on a leash.

It's possible that we're not getting weirder. Maybe we're relaxing into our authentic, uninhibited selves. After all, we don't have the constant barrage of people interactions to keep our quirks in check.

""During a crisis and isolation, many take an inventory of their lives and dare to be themselves, and engage in weird, creative, and non-conforming patterns,"" said Judith Zackson, a clinical psychologist based in Greenwich, Connecticut, via email.

Some of her clients are more outspoken than they were pre-pandemic, Zackson said. They have experienced changes in personal style, weird sleeping patterns and hobbies, and even sillier humor.

Of course, she also hears from people annoyed by their partners' stranger tendencies, which include apocalyptically hoarding food and supplies, and hobbies like collecting stones or walking their cat.

Mental health has been a real concern during the past 10 months of pandemic-induced stay-at-home orders. Anxiety and depression are up and social isolation may very well have long-term impacts we won't begin to even make sense of for years to come.

There is, though, the lesser studied phenomenon of people just becoming weirder. All those months devoid of normal human contact compounded with navigating the trifecta of a global health crisis, economic uncertainty and political division, and a lot of us are a little (or a lot) weirder than we were a year ago.

The image we sketch in our brain when we conjure the hermit is a disheveled man with wiry hair and crumpled clothes who mutters to himself and picks at plates of half-eaten food strewn all around an unheated cottage buried deep in the woods. I know I've felt like this man at least a dozen times in the past year.

Maybe we are WEIRD

Doing needlepoint isn't weird, at least not anymore.

Our proclivity to weirdness has a history that predates Covid-19.

Joseph Henrich, professor and chair of Harvard University's department of human evolutionary biology, came up with the acronym WEIRD -- Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic -- to describe the European culture that dominated the global stage for so long, as he outlines in his book "" The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous .""

Among the norms imposed was the stigmatization of incest. Marrying your cousin, a common practice in the United States in pre-Civl War times, started to become taboo in the late 19th century, when some states began prohibiting marriage between first cousins. The culture then became strange in that it departed from the rest of the world's social structures, which placed an emphasis on community or the whole of the society over the individual.

European culture, which very much informs today's American culture to the nth degree, shifted focus to personal pursuits, enabled in good part by the industrial revolution and the rise of wealth. The rise of individualism opened up the channels of differentiation and the increased possibility of people branching out to become their own, weird selves.

A little strange can be good

Being weirder isn't in itself a problem, though, according to Zackson. It depends on how weird you've become and what particular behaviors or actions develop as a result. It's possible, in fact, that being a little stranger is a good thing.

""Eccentric individuals see challenges and solutions from unexpected angles, and their weird thinking allows them to come up with innovative and imaginative solutions,"" Zackson said. ""By choosing to march to your own beat, you can access your creativity, curiosity, happiness and make a difference in the world.""

We need only to look to some of history's most eccentric public figures -- Lady Gaga, Prince, Andy Warhol, Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein -- to know that weird has its benefits.

""I'm less weird (since Covid-19), but only because the things I like doing -- keeping to myself and staying home, needle crafting hobbies -- became mandated or more popular, not because I have changed,"" said Venus Carey, a New York-based database manager.

It's true that the labels that we've assigned people who we've historically deemed weird -- hermits, germaphobes and hypochondriacs -- have become completely normalized in an environment where we have to keep our distance from others and wash our hands until they are raw.

""I have always had a soft spot for eccentrics, and I have worked long and hard to be eccentric myself, with mixed results,"" said Andy Duncan, an English professor at Frostburg State University who studies weirdness and writes weirdness in the form of speculative fiction. He just filed his first UFO report, citing a sighting of moving and blinking lights in a recent night sky over his Maryland house.

""The eccentricity I value is essentially benign, a harmless individualism that reflects a unique, cockeyed view of the world, and spices up what otherwise might be a mundane menu,"" Duncan said.

""These eccentrics tend to be self-aware and tongue in cheek. They're winking at us. Some eccentrics, moreover, are just visionaries ahead of their time, like the early advocates of such eccentric notions as animal welfare.""

Go for the weird (safely)

One part social isolation. Two parts ennui. Our weirdness might be both a subconscious relaxing of social norms and a deliberate attempt to replace lost social connections with self-entertainment by way of quirk.

So, maybe we talk to ourselves more than our 2019 selves would have deemed acceptable, or dress up in bizarre combinations of accoutrement found around the house when we tire of sweatpants. Why the hell not?

Go ahead and wear that dishrag on your head and rock out to Queen.

Sing operettas to your French bulldog.

Myanmar will test Biden's commitment to defending global democracy,"This was excerpted from the February 2 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.

(CNN) Myanmar's military coup is a tragedy for a people who have enjoyed fragile freedom after decades of darkness under dictatorship. It also marks the failure of an effort by the United States and its allies to instill democracy and to draw the country out of China's orbit.

Long-established democratic structures held firm in the US when an autocratic leader wanted to steal an election, but Myanmar's quasi democracy dissolved early on Monday morning local time, leaving it yet again under the boot of a junta. Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's civilian leader since the military constitution barred her from serving as President, is back under house arrest, where she spent much of the last 30 years. Pro-democracy leaders have been rounded up. The future looks bleak again.

Myanmar's generals clearly took advantage of Aung San Suu Kyi's tarnished global reputation . Her staunch denials that Myanmar's military was guilty of genocide against Rohingya Muslims revealed a nationalist streak that the West had ignored in its zeal to impose a heroine narrative on Myanmar's complex political story.

But ""the Lady"" remains beloved inside Myanmar. And her current plight is a reminder that fledgling democracies need support. Washington has lost focus on Myanmar since former President Barack Obama's visit to Yangon in 2012, which saw hundreds of thousands of euphoric citizens pour onto the streets. The Trump administration lacked a coherent Southeast Asia policy and cared little about democracy anywhere. Its top officials were rarely seen in a region where showing up is everything. The US stood by as the military in Myanmar's neighbor Thailand also snuffed out democratic rule.

US President Joe Biden now faces a test of his clout in Asia . He's already threatening sanctions, but strangling the economy amid the pandemic would cause more pain for its people. As the Myanmar military turns off internet and communications networks, closes banks, and sends soldier patrols into city streets, can Biden corral India, Japan, Australia and the nine other Association of Southeast Asian Nations members to mitigate the severity of the crackdown?

Deadly storm that dumped feet of snow across the Northeast takes aim at northern New England,"(CNN) A deadly winter storm that dumped several feet of snow in the Northeast and brought coastal flooding slowly moved toward an end Tuesday.

Still some storm activity -- showers and gusty winds -- are expected to continue into Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.

People in the region on Tuesday were digging out of heavy snow -- including almost 3 feet in parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- that closed or snarled roads, airports and public transit systems

The storm directly led to the death of at least one person, authorities said. Patricia Becker, a 67-year-old with Alzheimer's disease, wandered from her home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and was found dead of hypothermia. Her death was ruled an accident, Lehigh County Coroner Eric D. Minnich said in a statement.

Three other people died Monday in a homicide-suicide following a dispute over snow shoveling in Plains, Pennsylvania, police said.

Among the highest snowfall totals reported so far were 35.1 inches in Mount Arlington, New Jersey, and 35 inches in Angels, Pennsylvania, according to the National Weather Service

New York's Central Park saw more than 17 inches of snow by Tuesday -- placing the storm in the top 20 snowstorms in the city's recorded history.

The city's public schools were conducting only online classes, keeping students at home as crews worked to clear roads and motorists tried to dig out the cars they'd parked on the sides of streets.

In Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood, Jose Battiste was furiously trying to shovel out his car Monday night, hoping to drive to his hospital job Tuesday morning. ""Maybe an hour and a half more to finish shoveling the snow,"" he told CNN affiliate WCBS

In Allentown, Pat Deginto was shoveling her sidewalk for a third time. ""I'm thinking next year I'm moving to Florida,"" Deginto, 71, told CNN affiliate WPVI

The New York governor's office warned that neighborhoods along the coast could experience ""multiple rounds of flooding, especially during high tides.""

A home in the Massachusetts town of Sandwich was damaged in a December storm and is now in worse shape.

Minor to moderate flooding was reported across the region's coast early Tuesday, enough to flood out basements and roads and cause minor structural damage, according to CNN meteorologist Michael Guy. Water levels were about 2-4 feet above normal, Guy said.

""This type of flooding is extremely dangerous and can be deadly,"" said Guy.

More than a foot of snow covered parts of Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

Some vaccination sites were closed Tuesday

Vaccination sites across New York were closed Monday because of the storm, and at least five state-run vaccine sites in the state were to be closed Tuesday, the governor said.

""For the safety of both workers and individuals scheduled to receive a vaccination, we will be postponing appointments for tomorrow at several vaccination sites that are being impacted by this storm,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. ""To be clear -- no one is losing an appointment -- they will all be rescheduled when conditions are safer.""

In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy announced state offices and the state's six vaccine mega-sites will remain closed Tuesday as a result of weather conditions.

The vaccination sites will open Wednesday, the governor told CNN affiliate WABC.

In Pennsylvania, where Gov. Tom Wolf signed a disaster emergency proclamation in response to the storm, officials said Monday they were worried about how the conditions would affect vaccinations.

""Throughout the storm, (the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency) is working with our state and county partners to make sure we have a clear understanding of the storm and how it is affecting different parts of the state,"" said PEMA Director Randy Padfield

""We are particularly concerned with shipment and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, so we appreciate citizens who are taking this storm seriously and staying off the roads because fewer vehicles means fewer incidents that could delay those operations,"" Padfield said in a statement.

Dangerous travel conditions across the region

As the storm pummeled Connecticut on Monday, Stamford authorities said they rescued two people from a pickup truck that was hit by high winds, snow and a strong tide that caused the vehicle to fill with water.

Monday afternoon, firefighters found the truck partially submerged and floating 40 feet from the shore, the Stamford Fire Department said. A female was standing on one side of the vehicle shouting that a man was trapped inside, the department said.

Firefighters found the vehicle floating about 40 feet from the shore.

Firefighters swam to the vehicle and were able to get the female out with the help of an aerial ladder, while they worked to rescue the man as the truck quickly became entirely submerged by water,"" the department said in a news release.

""One firefighter maintained a physical hold on the man's arm and was able to pull him through the small window after the truck was completely under water,"" the department said. ""Once he was free, firefighters placed the man into the tower ladder and both occupants were brought to shore.""

The man was later transported to the hospital, authorities said."
Opinion: IEA head: The world isn't moving fast enough on clean energy,"Fatih Birol is executive director of the International Energy Agency. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

The global race to net-zero emissions has begun. But the world has much further to run.

The European Union Japan , the UK and many other major world economies have set ambitious goals to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. China , the world's biggest emitter, is aiming to be carbon neutral before 2060. And US President Joe Biden announced the nation's return to the Paris Agreement and is putting the fight against climate change at the heart of his administration's goals.

These announcements must now be backed up by equally ambitious actions to reach net-zero emissions as soon as possible and prevent global warming from surging past 1.5 degrees. Political, industrial and technology leaders must be laser-focused on transforming our energy infrastructure to address climate change. A big part of the challenge is that right now, we don't have all the technologies we need to do that.

Our recent analysis at the International Energy Agency shows that almost half of the emissions reductions needed to reach net zero by 2050 may need to come from technologies that haven't reached the market today.

It's true that solar panels, wind turbines, electric cars, lithium-ion batteries and other trail-blazing clean energy technologies have made it possible for us to seriously envision a net-zero world. But we won't be able to get there by 2050 without giant leaps in innovation in a range of other clean technologies — some of which are still in the lab. This is especially urgent in sectors like steel shipping and aviation , where emissions are the hardest to reduce and cost-effective solutions are lagging behind.

Several factors will influence how quickly the world can advance and deploy these new technologies. Here are two that government decision-makers should consider:

Leadership

In these extraordinarily turbulent times, governments have the greatest capacity and responsibility to take decisive action and show companies and investors the path forward. In the United States, President Biden has signaled a commitment to spurring the kinds of major technological leaps in clean energy that we will need to make these transformational changes cheaper and smoother.

But global net-zero emissions cannot be achieved without everyone on board, and American leadership is critical. The United States has been at the forefront of many of the defining technological leaps of the modern era: jet planes, microchips, the internet and so much more. And more recently, US policymakers, researchers and entrepreneurs are responsible for major progress in technologies spanning renewable power electric cars and carbon capture . US research labs, tech companies and venture capitalists are world-renowned. It's the world's largest economy with the deepest capital markets. What America does still matters for the world.

And America needs to make sure it doesn't fall behind in the industries of the future. This is a strategic opportunity for countries to ensure that their economies come out of today's crisis stronger and with the right industrial bases to supply growing markets in a world that is moving toward a clean energy future.

Investment in the private sector

The lion's share of inventors, entrepreneurs and investors are in the private sector, which will be crucial for achieving the technological transformation that will get the world to net zero. Despite the disruptions of the Covid-19 crisis, we see encouraging signs of a renewed private sector focus on clean energy innovation.

Recent announcements by Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Elon Musk are just two examples of the strong interest from investors and business leaders in tackling the toughest clean energy innovation challenges.

But markets have already shown that, left to their own devices, they won't bring about change quickly enough to avoid a climate disaster. If governments rise to the challenge created by the Covid crisis, they have the chance to accelerate clean energy innovation.

Governments have played — and must continue to play — a pivotal role in enabling innovators to pursue new ideas and supporting the best ones to find a route to profitability. Public funding for research and development is at the heart of this effort, and governments should increase it for clean energy technologies.

From a global perspective, more funding raises our chances of rapid technological advances. It will enable us to cheaply generate hydrogen from wind or solar power on an industrial scale and have it available on demand across the globe for use in steel mills, ships and a range of other areas. It means developing systems that can capture carbon emissions from industrial plants such as cement factories — and even from thin air — before burying the carbon safely underground or reusing it without producing further emissions.

It means expanding the reach of low-carbon electricity far beyond its current role so that it does everything from powering our cars to providing heat for our homes, offices and factories. And it means producing new biofuels to replace fossil fuels in airplanes and many other industries.

A roadmap to net zero

The IEA is committed to catalyzing global innovation efforts by tracking progress around the world, by analyzing what works (and what doesn't) and by providing governments and companies with a place they can share knowledge and best practice. We are also keeping a close eye on ensuring the shift to clean energy remains affordable and doesn't undermine countries' economic health.

To help show the way ahead of the COP26 climate change conference in the United Kingdom in November, we will in May publish the world's first comprehensive roadmap for the global energy sector — spanning power, transport, industry and buildings — to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

Today, I'm confident that the world is entering a new age of historic progress in clean energy innovation and technology. And the race to net zero can result in many winners across the globe."
"More than 100,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US since January 1, JHU data shows","(CNN) More than 100,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the United States so far this year, according to Johns Hopkins University data .

Since January 1, the US reported a total of 100,317 Covid-19 deaths, bringing the total number of reported deaths in the US since the start of the pandemic to 446,689 by Tuesday evening.

The first Covid-19 related death came on February 29, 2020, in Washington state. Later in the spring, two earlier deaths in California were posthumously confirmed to be of Covid-19.

The US has had more Covid-19 deaths than any other country, JHU data shows. Brazil has tallied over 200,000 deaths. Mexico, India and the United Kingdom have all reported over 100,000 deaths.

There are now more vaccinations than reported cases

The number of people who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is now greater than the number of US Covid-19 cases reported during the entire pandemic.

More than 26.3 million cases have been reported over the past year, according to Johns Hopkins University.

But that doesn't mean the pandemic is going away. Here's why:

The number of coronavirus infections may be four times higher than the number of cases actually reported, researchers say. In mid-January, CDC estimated the US has actually seen 83.1 million Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began. ""Even after adjusting for underreporting, a substantial gap remains between the estimated proportion of the population infected and the proportion infected required to reach herd immunity,"" the researchers wrote.

New, highly contagious variants are spreading across the US, threatening to reinfect people who've already had the coronavirus.

Only about 1.84% of the US population has received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. And it'll be at least several months until most Americans can get vaccinated.

As part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, chains CVS and Walgreens will begin administering vaccines starting next week. The White House listed 21 national pharmacy chains that will participate in the initial phase of the program.

While CVS and Walgreens have been administered vaccines in some states using those states' supplies, this is the first time CVS and Walgreens will be sent the vaccine directly from the federal government.

'This doesn't appear to be great news for vaccine efficacy'

While viruses mutate all the time , a few variants in particular are worrying scientists:

All three of those variants have been found in the US, and the B.1.1.7 strain has been detected in at least 32 states

Johnson & Johnson's chief scientific officer Dr. Paul Stoffels told CNN's Richard Quest on Tuesday that the world needs to vaccinate as many people as possible to limit the number of coronavirus variants.

""If we don't get the pandemic under control soon, then variants will start emerging, and will continue to emerge, and that will result in more vaccinations annually,"" Stoffels said. ""The mission is to get the virus under control so that it can't mutate, and it can't grow and create new versions.""

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is not yet authorized, but the company said it will ask the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization this month.

Scientists have now discovered a mutation in at least 11 samples of the B.1.1.7 strain that might escape antibody protection, according to a report Monday by Public Health England.

The mutation, called E484K, was already part of the genetic signature of variants linked to South Africa and Brazil.

A new lab study found that antibodies from vaccinated people were less effective at neutralizing a synthetic virus resembling samples of B.1.1.7 that had developed an E484K mutation.

""This doesn't appear to be great news for vaccine efficacy,"" said Joseph Fauver, an associate research scientist in epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.

Experts say this news could mean the B.1.1.7 strain, already known to be more transmissible, might be somewhat resistant to the protection given by vaccines, or more likely to cause reinfection among people who were previously infected.

Previous studies suggest that E484K may be the key reason why certain vaccines appear less effective in South Africa . Lab research has also shown that antibodies appear less able to bind and neutralize spike proteins arising from the mutation.

Similarly, Dr. Anthony Fauci told MSNBC's Chris Hayes on Tuesday that officials have to keep an eye on the variants as they could become a problem if they become dominant.

""One of the wildcards Chris, that we have to keep an eye on, are the mutations, the mutants that are out there, because if they become dominant that then can lead to another surge, but the best way to prevent them from becoming dominant is double-down on public health measures,"" Fauci said.

However, Fauci said that ""if"" Americans double down on public health measures and continue vaccinating, the country should continue to see a downward trend.

Ex-FDA scientist: Stop using convalescent plasma for Covid-19

The US should stop using convalescent plasma to treat the coronavirus because it might help the virus evolve into new and potentially more dangerous variants, a former pandemic adviser to the Biden transition team said.

Convalescent plasma -- taken from the blood of Covid-19 survivors -- simply does not work well, and allows the virus to keep on replicating and evolving in the bodies of patients, said Dr. Luciana Borio, a longtime biodefense consultant to US administrations.

""As an additional measure to reduce the chances that the virus develops more mutations that could evade the immune system, I would encourage the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to rescind the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) it issued last year for convalescent plasma,"" Borio said in written testimony submitted to the House Energy and Commerce Committee ahead of a Wednesday hearing.

Last August, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19, saying the ""known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.""

""We already know that, in aggregate, this therapy does not help patients with COVID-19. But by using it in circumstances where it does not work, we are providing the virus with a roadmap that could help it develop mutations that evade natural and vaccine induced immune responses even more rapidly,"" wrote Borio, who is currently vice president at strategic investment firm In-Q-Tel.

""Convalescent plasma has been used in more than 150,000 patients despite recommendations by the NIH (National Institutes of Health) that its use should be limited to randomized controlled trials, and now the possibility that its indiscriminate use could add more selective pressure on the virus and hasten the day when vaccines become less effective,"" said Borio, who is also a former acting chief scientist for the FDA.

Pfizer to deliver 200 million vaccine doses 2 months earlier than planned

The maker of one of two vaccines currently administered in the US confirmed Tuesday that it expects to deliver 200 million doses to the US by the end of May.

Pfizer was originally scheduled to deliver the 200 million doses by July 31. But CEO Albert Bourla said last week he expects the company's production to be ahead of schedule by two months.

""In the US, we had promised to provide 100 million doses by the end of the first quarter and we will be able to provide 120 right now,"" Bourla said last week.

""The same is with second quarter. We were planning to provide them all the way to 200 million doses by the end of the second quarter, actually beginning of the third. Right now, we will be able to provide the 200 million doses two months earlier.""

The Biden administration has announced it will be purchasing an additional 100 million doses from the company.

Pfizer said it had supplied 20 million doses to the US as of Sunday.

Both Pfizer's vaccine and the vaccine made by Moderna require two doses, spaced 21 days and 28 days apart."
Japan plans to extend its state of emergency as Covid-19 cases rise and Olympics loom,"(CNN) Japan plans to extend its state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka and eight other prefectures as the country continues to battle rising Covid-19 cases, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Tuesday.

The move comes as questions persist over the country's readiness to host the Olympics, which are scheduled to be held in Tokyo this summer from July 23 to August 8.

Eleven of Japan's 47 prefectures are currently under a state of emergency that orders companies to facilitate work from home where possible, and requires restaurants to close by 8 p.m. Sports and entertainment events in Japan are also required to limit the number of attendees.

Suga told Japan's Parliament Tuesday that he plans to extend the state of emergency -- which is set to expire Sunday -- until March 7 for 10 of the prefectures. The state of emergency is set to be lifted for one prefecture, he said.

That decision still needs to be finalized by the government's coronavirus task force, and Suga is expected to hold a press conference Tuesday night over the state of emergency rules.

Taiwan authorities revoke quarantine fine for man after discovering he was kidnapped,"Hong Kong (CNN) — Taiwanese authorities said they will no longer fine a man for breaking quarantine because investigators discovered he was kidnapped in an unfortunate case of mistaken identity.

The man, whose surname is Chen, had arrived from Hong Kong in late October and was quarantining at a friend's house in the central city of Nantou, according to a statement from the Changhua Branch of the Ministry of Justice's Administrative Enforcement Agency.

On November 1 at 11 p.m., debt collectors broke in and whisked Chen away against his will, mistaking him for his friend. They forced him to pay the debts and eventually returned Chen, who sustained injuries during the ordeal.

Related content Taiwanese man fined $35K for breaking home quarantine 7 times

Local public health authorities initially fined Chen $3,500 for violating the quarantine order, but the case was handed over to the Ministry of Justice to investigate the claims of forced detention.

Police verified Chen's claim and the kidnappers are now under investigation, authorities said.

While the case is unusual, the hefty fine is not. Taiwan has levied a series of large fines on people violating quarantine as part of its world-class response to the pandemic.

A migrant worker from the Philippines was fined $3,500 for stepping out of his room for eight seconds while quarantining in a hotel in the island's southern Kaohsiung City, and a man in Taichung in central Taiwan was fined $35,000 for violating home quarantine at least seven times, local media reported.

Experts say that Taiwan response to the pandemic has been one of the most successful thanks to its early, decisive action -- an important lesson the island took away from the deadly SARS outbreak.

Taiwanese authorities began screening passengers on direct flights from Wuhan, where the virus was first identified, on December 31, 2019 -- back when the virus was mostly the subject of rumors and limited reporting and well before Wuhan itself went into lockdown. By March, Taiwan had banned all foreign nationals from entering the island, apart from diplomats, residents and those with special entry visas. Those entering were required to undergo quarantine.

Authorities also invested in rapid track and trace programs and widespread testing, both of which made it easy to keep the pandemic in check. The democratically-ruled island of 23 million went months without a case , and to date has confirmed only 918 Covid-19 cases and eight virus-related deaths."
Anger and anxiety over what's to come following Myanmar's coup,"(CNN) The streets of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, appeared outwardly calm Tuesday morning, as residents made their way to work a day after the military detained Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratically-elected leaders and seized control of the country .

But behind the business-as-usual facade, anxiety is growing among many as to what will come next. Memories of living under the brutal military rule of the past are seared into the minds and bodies of many Burmese people. Critics, activists, journalists, academics and artists were routinely jailed and tortured during nearly 50 years of isolationist rule.

There are now fears that Monday's actions could be a prelude to a wider clampdown. In all, the new ruling junta removed 24 minsters and deputies from government over allegations of election fraud and named 11 of its own allies as replacements who will assume their roles in a new administration.

On Tuesday, Health Minister Myint Htwe also announced on Facebook that he was leaving his post ""as per the evolving situation.""

Questions as to the exact whereabouts of, and who is in communication with, senior members of the formerly ruling National League for Democracy (NLD), including recently deposed State Counsellor Suu Kyi , remain unclear.

One member of parliament (MP), who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, told CNN by phone on Tuesday that around 400 MPs are being detained in a large guesthouse in Naypiydaw.

The MP described the guesthouse as a large compound where detainees are able to roam freely, but are prohibited from leaving by military guards patrolling the gates.

He also said that, so far, the detained politicians are not trying to negotiate their release and do not know what will happen to them.

In a statement Tuesday, the NLD called for the immediate release of those detained, including recently deposed President Win Myint and Suu Kyi, and to allow the country's third parliament to govern.

It also called for the recognition of November's general election results and said the coup was ""a defamatory act against the history"" of Myanmar and its government.

In Naypyidaw Tuesday, though most businesses had reopened, a heavier security presence remained. Tanks were seen at the gates of parliament, and soldiers were standing guard outside a government guesthouse where some politicians who were detained in the coup said they were being held.

While communications across the country remained spotty with intermittent connections on phone and data, banks had reopened, according to state-run newspaper Global New Light of Myanmar. In Yangon, residents could be seen queuing to get cash out at ATMs.

NLD spokesperson Kyi Toe late Monday said on his personal Facebook page that Suu Kyi was being held at her official residence, where she was ""feeling well"" and ""walking in the compound frequently.""

A statement purportedly from the de facto leader was published on her party's official Facebook account Monday, calling for people to protest against the coup, though there were questions about the statement's authenticity.

""The actions of the military are actions to put the country back under a dictatorship,"" the statement said.

Suu Kyi has not been seen since she was detained early on Monday morning. The statement ends with her name but is not signed, and it was unclear how Suu Kyi would issue a statement while in detention.

Analysts warned that social media accounts could have been hacked or taken over by bad actors in order to encourage actions that might provide a pretext for further military force.

A newspaper seller points at a front-page of a newspaper in Yangon, Myanmar, Febuary 2, 2021.

The only demonstrations seen so far have been small-scale and from pro-military supporters. Suu Kyi, however, remains enormously popular, especially among the country's majority Bamar ethnic group.

Doctors working in hospitals across Myanmar have pledged to go on strike from Wednesday to protest the coup.

The Assistant Doctors group at Yangon General Hospital released a statement on Tuesday saying it would take part in the ""civil disobedience movement.""

The doctors say they will not work under a military-led government and called for Suu Kyi and Myint to be released.

Though her supporters have yet to take to the streets, many in Yangon have privately expressed anger over the military's actions, which they said disregarded the will of the people in what was considered to be a generally fair election.

Some have also questioned why the military would take over when they benefited from the previous legislative arrangement. The military, or Tatmadaw, as they are officially known, were constitutionally guaranteed 25% of seats in parliament and control over powerful ministries.

One Yangon-based reporter said he spent a sleepless night worrying about whether he would get a knock on the door and was scared that journalists would be targeted next.

""All the people now realize what the military are capable of. This is who they are and this is how they rule. You cant underestimate them. All Burmese people understand now, that, OK, this is the real situation -- the past five years, the freedom we got, is nothing,"" said the reporter, who didn't give his name due to the potential dangers.

Disastrous economic and socialist policies under dictator General Ne Win had plunged the country into poverty and a mass popular uprising against his regime in 1988 was brutally put down by the military. Another coup in September that year installed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), and during its rule, thousands of people including democracy leaders, activists and journalists were imprisoned for decades.

Others fled into exile abroad or went to the jungles and took up arms against the military government as part of a student army (ABSDF).

""We've got trauma. Nobody wants to get shot, flee the country, join in the jungle like the ABSDF did before. Nobody wants that situation again,"" said the Yangon reporter.

News of the coup, he said, was like history repeating itself. He remembers listening to the radio when his dad was arrested and spent 10 years in jail on political charges when he was 3 years old.

""All the things happened during those 36 years, history is repeating. The cycle is repeating. Nothing is new, nothing is strange. It is the same,"" he said.

The United Nations Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting Tuesday, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saying the events were a ""serious blow to democratic reforms.""

Myanmar's military stand guard at a checkpoint manned with armored vehicles blocking a road leading to the parliament building on Febuary 2, 2021, in Naypyidaw, Myanmar.

UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar Tom Andrews on Monday called for the imposition of sanctions and an arms embargo on the country.

""Now, more than ever, we must act,"" he said on his official Twitter account.

The unfolding situation in Myanmar is also a big test for US President Joe Biden , who called on Myanmar's military leaders to relinquish power and threatened to review sanctions on the country.

The United States removed sanctions on Myanmar over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. ""The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action,"" Biden said in a statement.

There is evidence that the uncertainty over what's to come in the immediate aftermath of the coup is having an impact on international business.

On Tuesday, Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation announced it has stopped production at its two factories in Myanmar to secure the safety of its workers following the coup. About 400 people work in the factories and the company's public relations officer Mitsuru Mizutani said they will restart when the security of their workers is ensured, though they do not know when that will be."
Pandemic still dwarfing the size of DC's efforts to fight it,"(CNN) The long war against Covid-19 , ever more daunting in the dispiriting months of winter, is now posing a fundamental question over whether the US has the political, economic and national will to prevail before the disaster gets much worse.

A race against time to vaccinate sufficient Americans before mutant versions of the virus cause a new wave of sickness and death is turning into a critical stress test for a mass immunization effort off to a difficult start.

And there is a disconnect in Washington over the scale of the crisis , with Democrats demanding a ""go big"" economic rescue plan and the few Republicans who back action envisaging a much more modest approach.

It remains unclear whether vaccine and testing efforts, attempts to alleviate harrowing economic suffering and the level of buy-in from the American people themselves are sufficient for the challenges that lie ahead.

""We have got to prepare ourselves for a long battle,"" William Haseltine, a groundbreaking medical researcher and author, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday, warning of the potential of variant viral strains to prolong the pandemic.

""We can do it. We have to muster the popular will to do it. It can't be done only by leadership, it has to be done by each and every citizen,"" he said.

In a glimmer of hope on the economic fight, President Joe Biden spent two hours in the Oval Office with a group of Republican senators who have offered a counter-proposal less than one-third the size of his $1.9 trillion rescue package. Congressional Democrats, far less concerned than Biden about a bipartisan approach, say the GOP approach is far too small.

There was no sign of a breakthrough Monday, but in today's acrid Washington any meeting between Democrats and Republicans that does not end with open hostility is an incremental step forward.

In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that ""while there were areas of agreement, the President also reiterated his view that Congress must respond boldly and urgently, and noted many areas which the Republican senators' proposal does not address.""

The Republican reaction was tempered but courteous, adding to an impression that while Biden may take on board some GOP ideas, the prospect of a bipartisan vote for the final package remains remote.

""I would not say that we came together on a package tonight,"" Maine's Sen. Susan Collins said, but she praised the President for his openness to what she said turned out to be an ""excellent"" meeting that lasted two hours.

Still, the tone of the talks also offered some hope at a minimum that Biden's definition of unity -- that political disagreements shouldn't turn into flaming political warfare -- has a little traction.

Skeptical House Democrats

Capitol Hill Democrats are, however, deeply skeptical of taking the time to consult Republicans who have a sharply different take on the size of the crisis, a reality that narrows Biden's negotiating room.

Just before Biden convened the meeting with the GOP senators, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York started the procedural machinery they could use to ram through the super-sized Democratic plan using a measure known as reconciliation to overcome Republican stalling tactics.

And the White House spent the day running up to the meeting stressing that the size of the multiple crises afflicting the country means that slimmed-down rescue plans will not work. That is a point also underscored by the growing sense that relative normality is still many months away. A pandemic stretching late in the year would force Biden to quickly return to Congress for another rescue if a smaller package is agreed to now.

Biden's plan would send another $1,400 to many Americans and extend unemployment benefits through September. He'd spend tens of billions of dollars in vaccine and testing programs and to help schools reopen. He'd also send hundreds of billions in aid to states and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.

The Republican offer comes in at around $600 billion and includes similar amounts to battle the pandemic. It extends a slightly smaller weekly unemployment benefit until the end of June. It also offers stimulus payments -- of $1,000 -- but targets them more narrowly.

Can Biden steel America's morale?

The fate of the country -- and of Biden's presidency -- depends to a considerable extent on his capacity to steel Americans for the next stage of the battle and his ability to maintain national morale.

His White House has injected perceptible urgency to the fight, overhauling the faltering vaccine rollout of a previous President who most often ignored the worst domestic crisis in decades. Americans are now deluged with briefings and data from scientists, free to speak without fear of political repercussions. The most important priority will be scaling up the vaccine effort -- an operation that depends on the swift approval of a large Covid-19 rescue from Congress.

As new coronavirus infections decline and eventually hospitalizations and death rates fall, state governors are likely to face intense political pressure to restore a semblance of normal life.

Already some restrictions on restaurant openings and other measures are being eased in states like New York, Michigan and California. The majority of Republican voters, who already doubt Biden's legitimacy thanks to Trump's lies about a stolen election, are unlikely to take kindly to any calls for restraint from Biden.

And any easing of social distancing would provide exactly the conditions that new Covid-19 variants, from South Africa, the UK and US soil, need to seed another, even more virulent wave of infections.

Vaccines offer a way out of the crisis. But with Biden saying last week that it will take until the end of the summer for the US to reach a level of 300 million immunizations , the possibility of months more misery is very real.

Debate over vaccine schedule

The government's top infectious diseases specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, offered Americans some hope on Monday evening after predicting that the rate of vaccinations would ramp up quickly.

""There is light at the end of the tunnel,"" Fauci told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" But he also pleaded with Americans to intensify basic health precautions to stop mutant strains of the virus getting a disastrous hold before the full vaccine rollout.

Earlier, in a White House briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that while new infections slowed by 14.5% in the last week of January, that painted a misleading picture of the pandemic's potential in the coming weeks.

""While the recent decline in cases and hospital admissions are encouraging, they are counterbalanced by the stark reality that in January we recorded the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in any month since the pandemic began, with over 90,000 deaths recorded in January alone,"" Walensky said.

""Variants remain a great concern,"" the CDC director said, reporting the discovery of mutant strains that experts fear could soon become dominant countrywide, telling of 471 variant cases in 33 jurisdictions as of Sunday.

The prospect that variants are more infectious and slightly more deadly has provoked a debate inside and outside government over whether protocols on vaccinations should change.

Currently, states seek to ensure that immunized patients in high-risk categories get the full two-dose schedule. But some experts are suggesting that as many people as possible should get a first dose to provide limited immunity in a bid to slow the spread of viral variants.

Fauci told reporters there were currently no plans to change the system. But Walensky left open the possibility that adjustments that were suggested by science could be made in the future.

""Until we have further data we intend to follow the trials and to use the science to say 21 days for two doses with Pfizer and 28 for Moderna,"" she said, referring to two vaccines currently authorized by regulators for emergency use."
Congressional Democrats view bipartisan plan as low priority for Covid-19 relief,"(CNN) Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to give President Joe Biden the opportunity to secure Republican support for his broad Covid-19 relief package, but they aren't willing to wait long or shrink the size of the package to the levels GOP leaders are currently suggesting.

""Republicans want to climb out of a 13-foot hole with a 6-foot ladder,"" one senior aide to a Democratic senator told CNN on Monday. ""We don't have time to wait for them to get serious about the problem.""

Congressional Democrats' urgency was shown in the party leadership's decision to swiftly introduce budget resolutions, beginning the process of passing parts of the White House's relief package through reconciliation , a procedural shortcut. That could take up to a month, which would give Republicans the chance to come to the table but also leaves open the option to get the job done without them.

Biden has begun the process of extending Republicans a hand. The President hosted Republican senators for two hours in the Oval Office on Monday to hear out their proposal for a Covid-19 relief bill, which at $618 billion comes in at less than a third of the $1.9 trillion measure he is pushing.

Afterward, the lawmakers emerged to describe the meeting as ""cordial,"" ""frank"" and ""useful."" But they did not suggest Biden had come down from his figure, nor did they announce they were willing to meet him at a new number.

"The nobility of Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick(opinion)","Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore police officer, is a professor in the department of law and police science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. He is the author of ""Cop in the Hood,"" ""In Defense of Flogging,"" and ""Greek Americans."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) Sworn police officers are not defined just by a uniform, gun or badge. What makes them different from other people dedicated to public safety is the oath. The sworn oath is not symbolic. It is both a sacrifice and a privilege. It is real and binding.

Peter Moskos

Brian Sicknick took an oath to uphold the Constitution in 2008. In doing so, and only after doing so, he became a United States Capitol Police officer. On January 6, he upheld his oath and gave his life defending the Constitution. His body is to lie in honor at the Capitol on Tuesday.

I took a similar oath in 1999. There was none of the pomp and circumstance of a police academy graduation or the tragic solemnity of an officer's funeral.

Three of us were in a small windowless room in a Baltimore courthouse. Two of us signed our names in a log. The third, a woman seated at a desk, told us to raise our right hands. As we did so, she read some lines off a sheet of paper. I couldn't hear all the words, but I knew upholding the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Maryland were part of the bargain. After about 10 seconds of monotone reading, she stopped, looked up, and said, ""Say yes."" We did. We were now sworn police officers.

While the oath-taking may itself be anti-climactic (and drolly bureaucratic), its meaning is not lost on the police. I was honored to swear to defend the Constitution. I remain honored to have done so.

Liz Cheney gets boost from McConnell amid divisive intraparty battle over Trump's impeachment,"(CNN) Rep. Liz Cheney, under fire from former President Donald Trump and his staunchest defenders, is picking up support from some influential Republicans as her allies close ranks and resist the effort to oust her from the third-ranking spot in House GOP leadership.

On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was the latest Republican to give her a boost, saying in a statement to CNN that she had ""the courage"" to act on her convictions in the aftermath of her vote to impeach Trump last month on a charge he incited the deadly insurrection that ransacked Capitol Hill on January 6.

""Liz Cheney is a leader with deep convictions and the courage to act on them,"" McConnell said. ""She is an important leader in our party and in our nation. I am grateful for her service and look forward to continuing to work with her on the crucial issues facing our nation.""

The statement comes as a cross-section of GOP lawmakers -- from top Republicans in Senate leadership like fellow Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso to some conservative House Freedom Caucus members like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas -- have publicly defended Cheney in the face of the onslaught from Trump defenders eager to see her defeated. Last week, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, a close Trump ally, traveled to Wyoming to rally against Cheney, with the former President's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., calling into the event and demanding she be defeated in next year's primary.

The former President is focusing his political energy on targeting Cheney. According to one source, Trump has repeatedly questioned his Republican allies about efforts to remove Cheney from her leadership position and run a primary candidate against her. He has also been showing those allies a poll commissioned by his Save America PAC that purports to show that Cheney's impeachment vote has damaged her standing in Wyoming, even urging them to talk about the poll on television.

How to start investing in stocks with little or no experience,"New York (CNN Business) Investing for the first time can be downright intimidating.

It can bring up a whole host of nerve racking questions: Is it too risky? Is now the right time to invest?

But allowing fear to stop you from investing can be a big mistake.

In fact, the sooner you begin investing, the better off your financial future will be. Why? By investing early, you give your money time to grow.

After all, it's not about timing the market to get rich quick, but rather your time in the market and allowing your investments to compound. And while there's always going to be some risk involved, investing wisely helps reduce those risks significantly.

Here's how you can get started investing.

Figure out your game plan

Before making your first investment: ""it's important to assess what your goals are,"" said Trina Patel, a financial advice manager at financial service Albert.

Ask yourself what you're looking to achieve by investing, how much risk you're willing to take on and when you'll need the money.

Remember that different goals will warrant different strategies and time horizons. For example, if your goal is to save enough for a down payment on a home, that will likely require much less time than if you were saving for retirement.

Learning basic investing terms can also help you make the best decisions for your goals.

No such thing as a small investment

Many people assume that a lot of money is required to begin investing. But that isn't the case.

In fact, you can begin investing with as little as $5 or as much as $50,000.

Just be sure to take into consideration your investment goals and when you're looking to reach them.

It's also important to note that budgeting still matters. So make sure you still have enough money set aside for the essentials.

""To start investing well, you need to take care of the prerequisites,"" said Corbin Blackwell, a certified financial planner at Betterment, a financial advisory company that offers cash management and retirement advice.

Stick to a budget that allows you to take care of your expenses and pay down any high-interest debt. You should also set aside cash for an emergency fund. Emergency funds can help in the event of a financial emergency or serve as a cushion in case your investments take a dip.

How to get started

Saving for retirement is a common investment goal, and certain accounts — like 401(k)s and IRAs — are set up specifically for that purpose. Often the holder will pay some sort of penalty if they withdraw funds too early or for a reason other than retirement.

Luckily, if you're offered a 401(k) at work, it's pretty easy to get started. The accounts are typically funded through payroll deductions and may include a contribution match by your employer.

But suppose you don't have a 401(k). You can open an individual retirement account, such as a Roth or traditional IRA. Just be sure to compare the two, as they vary in tax benefits, contribution limits and income requirements. Many banks offer IRA or Roth IRA accounts. SoFi, Ally Invest and Schwab are some examples of places you can open a retirement account.

If you're saving for something other than retirement or need access to your money more quickly, you can opt for a taxable brokerage account, with a company like Fidelity, TD Ameritrade or Vanguard, instead. That means you'll have to pay taxes on any investment income within the account. This can include selling a stock or when your cash balance earns interest. It's important to note that these gains or income are taxable in the tax year they were earned — not when they are withdrawn.

Unlike retirement accounts which have restrictions on when you can withdraw funds, taxable brokerage accounts allow you to deduct money at any time. Since these accounts offer no tax advantages, there are no restrictions on when and how you can withdraw your money or how much you can contribute.

Where else can you open accounts?

Online brokers and robo-advisors are some other places where you can open accounts.

Online brokers, such as Webull and ETrade, enable you to manage your own investments and typically have no required minimum balance. But they do charge fees for things such as stock and options trading. So be sure to compare what each brokerage charges before choosing one.

Robo-advisors, on the other hand, are automated financial advisors that manage and choose your investments for you. These include digital platforms like Betterment and Wealthfront, which offer low minimums and a small management fee.

Patel says that using automated advisers can benefit newer investors looking to create a portfolio that aligns with their goals, risk tolerance and time horizon. She also suggests trying auto-investing, which involves scheduling reoccurring contributions toward your investment portfolio.

""You can easily see how that builds up, instead of starting with all your life savings at one time,"" she said.

Understanding your options

Once you've opened an account, you'll want to explore your investment options and the risk they carry. Here are some of the most common investments you'll need to consider:

Stocks are a share of ownership in a company and can be purchased individually for a share price or through mutual funds.

Bonds are loans taken out by a company or governments and typically pay a certain interest rate.

are loans taken out by a company or governments and typically pay a certain interest rate. Mutual funds are a bundle of investments that include assets such as stocks and bonds. Some of these funds are professionally managed and help to remove the burden of picking individual stocks or bonds. Mutual funds are traded once a day after the market close.

are a bundle of investments that include assets such as stocks and bonds. Some of these funds are professionally managed and help to remove the burden of picking individual stocks or bonds. Mutual funds are traded once a day after the market close. Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, similar to mutual funds, also include a bundle of assets, but trade on the stock exchange throughout the day and are bought for a share price.

It's important to remember to diversify your portfolio with a mix of asset classes to help balance out risk.

Mutual funds and ETFs, for example, are options that can provide first-time investors a chance to diversify. While investing in safer bets, like bonds, are a good way to set off riskier investments in things like real estate investment trusts (REITs).

The bottom line

No matter what route you take, investing is another way to grow your wealth, or as the saying goes ""make your money work for you.""

Investing can help you reach your financial goals such as buying a house, saving for retirement or even starting your own business. The younger you are when you start investing, the better your chances are of accruing higher returns. It also gives your money time to compound, which means the returns you earned from your investments can start to generate their own earnings.

""Think about investing as an overall strategy and way to preserve and grow your money,"" said Patel."
Rep. Tim Ryan is laying the groundwork on a Senate bid in Ohio,"(CNN) Rep. Tim Ryan is laying the groundwork for a run at Ohio's open Senate seat , a source familiar with his plans tells CNN, with the congressman planning a potential announcement in late February or early March.

Ryan's entrance into the race would represent a chance for Democrats to prove the party is still viable in a state that has drifted toward Republicans in almost every statewide race of the last decade. Ryan, a Democrat who has represented the Youngstown area since 2003 and mounted a long-shot 2020 presidential bid, is closely aligned with organized labor and often touts his blue-collar roots in the Mahoning Valley.

In a statement to CNN on Monday night, Ryan said only that he was ""very serious"" about the open Senate seat, which was created when Republican Sen. Rob Portman decided not to run for reelection in 2022.

""I've been hearing from Democrats across Ohio and the country who are excited at the possibility of picking up a Senate seat that we haven't held in decades,"" Ryan said. ""I have been encouraged by their support, enthusiasm, and commitment. The U.S. Senate needs another working class voice and I'm very serious about the opportunity to continue representing the people of Ohio.""

The congressman has previously flirted with running for statewide office in Ohio. In 2017, for example, he was courted to run for governor in 2018 but decided against it.

Ryan has received some high-profile encouragement to enter the race, including from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016.

The Ohio State Conference of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers endorsed his potential Senate bid on Monday, offering him ""our best wishes for a successful campaign.""

If Ryan officially gets into the race, he is unlikely to clear the field, though. Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley is considering both a run at the open Senate seat and a gubernatorial bid in 2022. Democrats also are growing more confident that Dr. Amy Acton, who rose to prominence as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine's public health director during the coronavirus pandemic, could announce a Senate run. And other Democrats have looked at Emilia Sykes, the young, Black minority leader of the Ohio House of Representatives, as someone who could mount a historic campaign and motivate the party's base.

""One thing that we have an opportunity to do is show that with diverse candidates, with women and people of color, there is a pathway to win,"" Sykes told CNN previously, adding that she is considering a bid. ""What we are learning is that when you put women on the ballot, women win. When you put people of color on the ballot, we win.""

Key to any Democratic bid will be the Republican who wins the party's primary. Portman's decision to retire caused nearly a dozen Republicans to consider running for the seat, making it possible that the party's primary could become a crowded, contentious affair.

Some of the possible Republican candidates include J.D. Vance, the author of ""Hillbilly Elegy""; Josh Mandel, the former state treasurer who lost a 2012 race to Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown; Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose; and Jane Timken, the Ohio Republican Party chair.

Last week, Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, decided not to run for the seat, opening the door to other House Republicans. At least four -- Reps. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup, Mike Turner and Warren Davidson -- are considering bids.

In the past three election cycles, Republicans won statewide races in Ohio for president, governor and Senate. Trump beat Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden there by 8 points in November.

But Brown's 2018 reelection victory gave the Democratic Party hope that its populist wing could still resonate in Ohio.

This story has been updated to include the endorsement of Ryan's potential bid by the Ohio State Conference of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers."
"Georgia police chief and officer pushed out over racist, misogynist remarks caught on camera at BLM rally","(CNN) The police chief and a patrolman in a small Georgia town have been pushed out of their jobs after they were caught having a racist, misogynist conversation while preparing to patrol a Black Lives Matter Rally in June 2020, according to Buddy Walker, an assistant to Hamilton Mayor Julie Brown.

Hamilton Police Chief Gene Allmond and Patrolman John Brooks can be heard on a body camera having the conversation. Brooks can be heard using racial slurs and making lewd comments about Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms as well as former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.

Allmond seemingly agreed with Brooks, saying, ""Yes, Sir"" in response to one of Brooks' lewd comments. Allmond later complained about the protests and made comments regarding slaves saying, ""For the most part it seems to me like they furnished them a house to live in, they furnished them clothes to put on their back, they furnished them food to put on their table and all they had to do was (bleep) work.""

CNN has not been able to obtain the unedited audio, and the version provided by the city of Hamilton censored some of the words the men used.

​Walker said the police department had not been using body cameras regularly but were ""trying to get them to work.""

February 1 Biden presidency and Trump impeachment news,"Following the House’s unveiling of their own budget resolution this afternoon, Democrats in the Senate will unveil their budget resolution tomorrow.

A memo being circulated by the Senate Budget Committee tonight lays out the framework and rational for Democrats beginning their budget reconciliation process, a procedural tool that will allow them to pass President Biden’s Covid relief plan with a simple majority.

The memo comes after a group of Senate Republicans met in the Oval Office with Biden for more than an hour.

“The Budget Resolution that the Senate will be debating this week will enable us to fast track President Biden’s $1.9 trillion emergency COVID-relief through reconciliation with 51 votes,” the memo reads.

The resolution outlined provides Senate Committees with nearly $1.9 billion to use to craft a Covid relief bill. Senate Budget will direct 11 Senate Committees to begin working on the bill including:

Agriculture

Finance

Banking

HELP

Commerce

EPW

Homeland Security

Indian Affairs

Foreign Relations

Veterans

Small Business

The Budget Committee plans to stay very close to what Biden proposed, promising to try and raise the minimum wage to $15 using reconciliation, expanding testing and tracing, vaccine distribution, providing more money for SNAP, funding for schools and providing direct $1,400 checks to individuals.

“The American people want us to act boldly and they want us to act now. Instead of listening to wealthy campaign contributors, it is time for the Senate to listen to the needs of working families, the elderly, the sick, the disabled and the poor. And that is exactly what this Budget Resolution will accomplish,” the memo says."
McConnell: Marjorie Taylor Greene's views are a 'cancer' for the GOP,"(CNN) Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Monday issued a tacit rebuke of controversial Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, slamming the Georgia Republican's ""loony lies and conspiracy theories"" as a ""cancer"" for the party.

""Loony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""Somebody who's suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.'s airplane is not living in reality. This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families or the robust debates on substance that can strengthen our party.""

While McConnell did not name Greene directly, his statement stands as a scathing rebuke of the freshman Republican House member. The Hill first reported on the statement.

Greene quickly shot back on Twitter , asserting that ""the real cancer for the Republican Party is weak Republicans who only know how to lose gracefully. This is why we are losing our country.""

Greene has faced backlash since a CNN KFile report last week found that she had repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress. Amid an uproar over her past comments, video of Greene confronting Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg before she was elected went viral Wednesday."
Production to ramp up for first fully at-home Covid-19 test authorized in US,"Components of Covid-19 at-home tests are seen at the production facility of Ellume in Brisbane, Australia, on December 21. Patrick Hamilton/AFP via Getty Images

The Biden administration announced the US Department of Defense and US Department of Health and Human Services are working with Australian company Ellume to provide more of its fully at-home Covid-19 tests to the United States.

""Ellume has been ramping up manufacturing and will ship 100,000 test kits per month to the US from February through July,"" Andy Slavitt, the senior Biden White House adviser for Covid Response, said during a White House briefing on Monday.

""That's good but it's obviously not where we'll need to be – so I'm excited to announce that today, the Department of Defense and HHS has awarded $230 million to Ellume in order to scale the manufacturing base and capacity of this easy-to-use test,"" Slavitt said. ""Thanks to this contract, they'll be able to scale their production to manufacture more than 19 million test kits per month by the end of this year, 8.5 million of which are guaranteed to the US government.""

Slavitt said the test can detect Covid-19 with 95% accuracy within roughly 15 minutes.

In December, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the Ellume Covid-19 test for emergency use. This antigen test, sold over-the-counter, can be done at home using a nasal swab, dropper and processing fluid. The test uses an analyzer that connects with a software app on your smartphone to help you perform the test and then interpret your results all from home, similar to at-home pregnancy tests.

Scientists have been pushing for this kind of accessible and affordable at-home testing since the start of the pandemic – and although the Trump administration previously insisted that anyone who wants a test can get one, that didn't always happen."
Biden freeze hits two Trump drug price rules,"(CNN) A freeze by the new Biden administration on Trump-era regulations will hit at least two rules aimed at lowering drug prices, including one dealing with insulin and EpiPens for under-served patients.

The halt follows a memo last month from White House chief of staff Ron Klain directing agencies to halt new and pending regulations from going into effect to ensure Biden officials have the opportunity to review them.

The Department of Health and Human Services issued a flurry of regulations that sought to address high drug prices, one of Americans' chief health care complaints,in the waning days of former President Donald Trump's term. They stemmed from a set of executive orders Trump signed in July and September.

Drug rebates

The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday agreed to push back the implementation of a controversial rebate rule until 2023.

The regulation would effectively ban drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers -- a radical change in the way many drugs are priced and paid for in Medicare and Medicaid. Instead, drug companies will be encouraged to pass the discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter.

The Trump administration had backed down from issuing this rule in 2019 after it was found to raise costs for seniors and the federal government, but issued the final rule in November.

The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents pharmacy benefit managers, sued the Trump administration to stop implementation of the rule. The group, along with America's Health Insurance Plans, argue that it would benefit drug manufacturers. A federal judge last week put the case on hold pending a review by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Insulin and EpiPens

The agency is also freezing a Trump rule requiring Federally Qualified Health Centers, which provide primary care services to underserved communities, to pass along discounts they receive on insulin and EpiPens to their patients.

The rule only affects medications these centers purchased through the 340B drug discount program, not the prices of these drugs for the general public.

Trump officials said the rule would increase access to these medications among the 28 million people who visit the centers annually, over 6 million of whom are uninsured.

The rule was to have taken effect on January 22 but was delayed to March 22 to give Biden's health officials time to review it and consider new regulations.

Community health centers opposed the rule, saying it would backfire and make it harder for them to provide these medications, particularly during the pandemic. They already offer sliding fee discounts to low-income patients, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers, an industry group.

Biden's drug-price goals

Reducing the cost of prescription medications is one of Biden's top health care priorities. He supports allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and consumers to import medicine from abroad.

It remains to be seen what the President's health officials will do with the two Trump-era rules related to these provisions.

The Department of Health and Human Services issued in a final rule in late September establishing a path for states and certain other entities to set up drug importation programs.

In late November, the agency issued to a final rule that calls for Medicare to pay the same price for certain expensive prescription drugs as other developed nations, a ""most-favored-nation price.""

Other nations typically pay far less for medications, in large part because their governments often determine the cost -- which runs counter to Republicans' allegiance to the free market system.

Federal courts temporarily halted implementation of the rule after multiple industry groups filed lawsuits."
Facebook tries to remind users about benefits of data collection ahead of Apple privacy change,"(CNN Business) Facebook said Monday that it is testing a new pop-up alert for iPhone and iPad users that stresses the benefits of its apps collecting personal data. The test comes ahead of an Apple privacy change with the potential to upend the social network's core business.

is set to introduce a new requirement for users to give explicit permission for apps to track them across the internet, a move that has roiled Facebook , which relies on data collection to target ads.

Now, Facebook plans to show a prompt ""of our own, along with Apple's"" in an effort to show users how personalized ads ""support small businesses and keep apps free,"" the company said in an update Monday to an older blog post called ""Speaking Up for Small Businesses.""

""As we shared in December, we disagree with Apple's approach, but will be showing their prompt to ensure stability for the businesses and people who use our services,"" Facebook said in the post.

For, the stakes of Apple's new privacy change couldn't be higher. The social media company, which makes almost all of its revenue from advertising, has repeatedlywarned investors that Apple's software changes could hurt its business if users reject tracking permissions.

held a press event to trot out small businesses opposed to the change and debuted a new hashtag to discuss it. In December, Facebook took out ads in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, saying the requirement could be ""devastating"" to millions of small businesses that advertise on its platform. It alsoheld a press event to trot out small businesses opposed to the change and debuted a new hashtag to discuss it.

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO and cofounder, hammered a similar point on a conference call with analysts last month to discuss the company's most recent earnings report.

""Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do, to preference their own,"" Zuckerberg said. ""This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes. Many small businesses will no longer be able to reach their customers with targeted ads.""

While this latest move may seem like yet another shot fired at Apple, Facebook is taking Apple up on its offer for any developer to explain why it wants certain permissions for tracking. ""We feel that people deserve the additional context, and Apple has said that providing education is allowed,"" Facebook said in the blog post.

On Apple's privacy and data webpage , the company said developers are allowed to do this ""so long as you are transparent to users about your use of the data in your explanation. ... Apps must respect the user's permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access.""

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple declined to comment."
"US Capitol riot: Investigators recommend no charges for police officer accused of killing rioter Ashli Babbitt during insurrection, sources say","(CNN) Investigators have recommended that prosecutors decline to bring charges against a US Capitol Police officer in the shooting of a pro-Trump rioter who was killed during the insurrection, according to people familiar with the matter.

The shooting of the Capitol rioter, Ashli Babbitt, remains under investigation by the DC Metropolitan Police, the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC, and civil rights prosecutors, a routine process for shootings involving the Capitol Police. A final decision hasn't been made, the people familiar with the probe told CNN.

Justice Department officials could make a final decision in the coming days.

A spokesperson for DC's Metropolitan Police Department said in an email to CNN that ""it is irresponsible to make an investigatory assumption or to jump to any conclusion without completing the thorough investigation."" CNN has reached out to the US Attorney's Office in DC for comment. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the recommendation.

""In every analysis, this was an absolutely justified use of force,"" said the officer's attorney, Mark Schamel, of Lowenstein Sandler.

"Animals unlikely to spread Covid-19 to humans, but precautions can help keep people and their pets safe, says CDC","(CNN) There's no evidence that animals are playing a significant role in the spread of coronavirus to humans, but precautions can help keep people and their pets safe, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said Monday.

""Based on limited information available to date, the risk of animals, including pets, spreading Covid-19 to people is considered to be low,"" CDC official Dr. Casey Barton Behravesh said during a briefing Monday.

Evidence suggests that Covid-19 likely originated in animals before becoming widespread among humans.

""As of the middle of January, we're aware of 187 animals from 22 countries with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" Behravesh said, noting those numbers do not include mink on mink farms. She added that no animal deaths have yet been linked to the virus.

The CDC is closely tracking research on coronavirus infections in animals and has categorized some animals based off their risk of infection. Animals that are highly susceptible to the virus include cats, hamsters, non-human primates, rabbits, mink and deer, Behravesh said.

Oregon's law decriminalizing small amounts of heroin and other street drugs officially goes into effect,"(CNN) Oregon has become the first state in the nation to officially decriminalize the possession and personal use of all drugs.

Voters in the state approved Measure 110 in November, but it officially went into effect Monday. The initiative also expands access to addiction assistance and other health services, offering aid to those who need it instead of arresting and jailing people for drugs.

Measure 110 passed with 55.8% of the vote.

Possession of drugs such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine will no longer be punishable by jail time, but instead amount to something similar to a traffic ticket.

""Today, the first domino of our cruel and inhumane war on drugs has fallen, setting off what we expect to be a cascade of other efforts centering health over criminalization,"" Drug Policy Alliance executive director Kassandra Frederique said in statement on Monday.

DHS says undocumented immigrants should get coronavirus vaccines,"(CNN) Undocumented immigrants should get coronavirus vaccines, the Biden administration said Monday, adding that federal authorities won't conduct immigration enforcement operations at vaccine distribution sites or clinics.

""It is a moral and public health imperative to ensure that all individuals residing in the United States have access to the vaccine. DHS encourages all individuals, regardless of immigration status, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine once eligible under local distribution guidelines,"" the Department of Homeland Security said

The statement from the department that oversees the nation's immigration enforcement marks a significant shift in tone from official declarations made during the Trump administration. It's the first time the department has encouraged undocumented immigrants to get vaccinated against coronavirus or discussed its immigration enforcement posture around vaccinations.

Many undocumented immigrants live in communities that have already been hit disproportionately by the coronavirus, but advocates have warned that widespread fear could stop many people from getting vaccinated

""I'm very, very concerned,"" Dr. Ranit Mishori, senior medical advisor for Physicians for Human Rights, told CNN in December. ""If we are as a country to achieve herd immunity, that means non-citizens who live among us have to be immunized."""
"February 1, 2021 coronavirus news","Biotechnology company Moderna is proposing to increase the number of doses per vial of its coronavirus vaccine by up to 50% to address a bottleneck in manufacturing.

Moderna president Dr. Stephen Hoge announced that the firm seeks to fill each vial with up to 15 doses instead of the current 10, according to a statement provided to CNN on Monday.

But this would only be implemented after “further discussions with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to assure the agency’s comfort,"" Hoge said.

The move was first reported by CNBC. CNN has also reached out to the FDA for comment.

According to Hoge, it’s not just the amount of vaccine available that might put a ceiling on production -- it’s also the number of vials that can be filled in a certain amount of time.

This comes as the company has been expanding its manufacturing capacity to nearly 1 million doses per day, according to the statement."
Here's what budget reconciliation is (and why it matters for Biden's stimulus),"Washington (CNN) As President Joe Biden pursues a bipartisan Covid-19 relief deal , Senate Democrats are laying the groundwork for passing relief without any Republican votes using a procedural shortcut known as budget reconciliation.

Reconciliation could allow Democrats to fast track key aspects of Biden's agenda, from Covid-19 relief to infrastructure, but the process comes with a strict set of rules attached.

Here's what you need to know:

What is budget reconciliation?

The reconciliation process was set up as part of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act to make it faster and easier to pass legislation related to spending, taxes, and debt, because debate on the bills is limited to 20 hours and can be passed on a simple majority vote.

Budget reconciliation allows lawmakers to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required for breaking filibusters and moving legislation forward.

Democrats currently control exactly 50 seats in the 100-seat chamber, and Vice President Kamala Harris holds the tie-breaking vote in her capacity as Senate president. That's enough for Democrats to be able to use reconciliation to pass some kinds of legislation.

What can be passed using budget reconciliation?

Bills are only eligible for the budget reconciliation process if they affect federal revenue or spending.

They are subject to what's known as the Byrd rule, a multi-pronged test designed to keep out provisions considered extraneous, without any real impact on the budget, or that might affect Social Security.

It is named for the late former Sen. Robert Byrd, a Democrat of West Virginia, who decried reconciliation bills for being loaded up with provisions considered far afield from their original purpose. In more colorful Senate jargon, provisions being scrubbed by the parliamentarian are undergoing a "" Byrd bath ."" When they don't pass muster with her and are removed from the bill, they are called ""Byrd droppings.""

As the committees write their bills, they will try to ensure their proposals will be approved by Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough who must enforce the Byrd rule. Senators can challenge the parliamentarian's decisions and vote to waive the Byrd Rule, but they would need a 60 vote majority to do so.

When has reconciliation been used before?

Reconciliation has been used many times by both parties to pass controversial legislation over the objections of the minority party, including former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act in 2010 and Trump's sweeping tax cuts in 2017.

How will budget reconciliation be used for the Covid package?

Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer introduced a budget resolution Monday, the first in a two-step process that will allow the work of writing the coronavirus relief bill in committees to begin.

The budget vote now will clear the way for Democrats to potentially pass their relief bill by late February or March after the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump is completed in the Senate.

Embedded in the budget resolution will be reconciliation instructions for several committees to write legislation, which in this case would deal with different aspects of Biden's Covid relief, including funds for vaccines production and distribution, unemployment insurance, stimulus checks and more.

The formal reconciliation instructions will ""direct one or more committees to recommend changes to existing law to achieve specified changes in spending, revenues, deficits, and/or the debt limit. Instructed committees can comply with their targets by making changes to any of the programs under their jurisdiction,"" according to the House Budget Committee, which is chaired by Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky.

What timetable are Democrats looking at for reaching a final package?

The party is mindful that they have to move their legislation by mid-March, when enhanced unemployment benefits for people impacted by the pandemic recession are set to expire.

The House would have to pass the budget resolution first and then send its version to the Senate. If the Senate amends it, the House would have to pass it again before the committees could begin work on the reconciliation instructions.

Where do things stand in the Senate?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is still working to shore up the support from centrists in his caucus -- including Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- to ensure he has the 50 votes needed to pass the budget resolution with a tie-breaking vote from Harris.

He can't lose one Democrat in his caucus.

In the Senate, debate on the resolution will be limited to 50 hours on the floor. But before a final vote occurs, senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments to the resolution in a process referred to in Senate parlance as a ""vote-a-rama.""

This time-consuming and stamina-challenging ritual often stretches past midnight and allows senators, through the amendments they offer, to highlight issues important to them and try to score political points by forcing politically sensitive votes on their opponents.

What are Republicans saying?

Republicans are frustrated that Democrats are threatening to use the aggressive tactic while bipartisan efforts continue, arguing it would set a partisan tone for the rest of Biden's presidency."
"To safely enjoy the Super Bowl, watch at home with people with whom you live, CDC says","(CNN) The pandemic has affected nearly every facet of daily life and the Super Bowl is no exception.

The yearly game to settle who is the champion of the NFL is this Sunday. The game, along with its accompanying hype and parties, comes just as health officials are begging Americans to hunker down to help stop the spread of new strains of the coronavirus.

So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has some tips on how to safely navigate Super Bowl Sunday. Their top piece of advice is -- not surprisingly -- to watch the game at home with the people you live with.

""Attending large gatherings including the Super Bowl increases your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19,"" according to the guidance posted on the CDC's website

If you insist on having a small watch party, the CDC says you should host it outdoors and make sure everyone has a mask. The guidance recommends limiting alcohol consumption because alcohol may make you less likely to follow Covid-19 safety measures.

Yale is offering its highly popular 'happiness' course to high school students for free,"Want more inspiring, positive news? Sign up for The Good Stuff, a newsletter for the good in life. It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.

(CNN) In order to help young people combat the growing mental health crisis brought on by the pandemic, Yale University is now offering a variation of its most popular online course to more than 500 low-income high school students across the US at no cost.

Yale psychology professor Laurie Santos created the online course -- called ""The Science of Well Being"" -- in 2018. It was introduced the same year as her in-person version of the course, ""Psychology and the Good Life,"" which attracted more than 1,200 undergraduates, or about one in four students on campus, in its first semester, according to a statement released by Yale.

Santos, who lived among students as the head of Yale's Silliman College, said the idea for the course came to her after she saw firsthand the growing levels of depression and anxiety her students were experiencing.

""This is a really challenging time, and that means that students need to learn new strategies to protect their mental health,"" Santos said in the release. ""Our goal is to equip students with scientifically validated strategies for living a more satisfying life, while also creating opportunities for high-striving low-income students and students of color to demonstrate college-readiness.""

The course -- which was developed in partnership with the University of Connecticut and the National Education Equity Lab with support from the Arthur M. Blank Foundation -- will ""present students with scientifically validated strategies for living a more satisfying life and examine what psychological science shows about how to be happier, how to feel less stressed, and how to flourish more,"" according to the university.

""It means everything to me,"" Grassman said just after getting the last shot at Ascension St. Vincent Evansville in Indiana. ""At my age, I didn't want to get the disease.""

It also means that eventually, Grassman will be able to get back to what she loves -- playing cards and bingo and being with her friends -- once most people are vaccinated.

""She's very social,"" her daughter, Mary Carl, said of Grassman. ""She's never met a stranger,"" she said, so the pandemic has been rough for Grassman, who has her own condo-like home at an independent living facility for seniors in Evansville.

Grassman is among the more than 5.6 million Americans who have been fully vaccinated, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. More than 25 million have received at least one vaccine shot, with most states aiming to immunize the elderly and others who are most vulnerable.

Here's how much snow the massive winter storm has dropped on some areas,"(CNN) A massive storm that's dumped snow from the Midwest to the Northeast is promising even more on Tuesday.

According to data from the National Weather Service, parts of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have already received more than 2 feet of snow.

The Pennsylvania communities of Nazareth and Ancient Oaks, and the New Jersey borough of Mendham, have seen at least 30 inches of snow, according to the weather service

New York City's LaGuardia Airport reported it had seen more than 12 inches of snow by Monday night. A crew was clearing the airfield of snow early Tuesday to try to allow flights to resume, the airport said, after commercial flights were canceled Monday.

""Please check the status of your flight before traveling to the airport,"" the airport said on Twitter.

More than 22 inches were reported in the New York town of Monsey, according to the weather service. And New York City's Central Park had received about 17.2 inches as of Tuesday morning.

Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport had 2.6 inches and Philadelphia International Airport saw a measurement of about 6.1 inches.

Worcester, Massachusetts, saw its second-highest daily snowfall record for the date of February 1 with 13.8 inches. Worcester's all-time record for the date was set in 1898 with 14 inches, the weather service said.

Meanwhile, Danbury, Connecticut, and Sabillasville, Maryland, both saw at least 19 inches of snow Monday.

Terra Alta, a town in West Virginia, saw about 15.6 inches of snow, the weather service reported Monday night.

Even parts of Georgia reported some snow, with Ringgold, a city near Chattanooga, Tennessee, recording about half an inch."
This NFL coach made diversity a priority. Now his team is headed to the Super Bowl,"(CNN) A glass ceiling shattered in the NFL in July 2015, when Bruce Arians -- then the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals -- hired Jen Welter to the team's coaching staff as an intern, making her the first woman to hold a coaching position of any kind in the league.

Now at age 68, in his second season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Arians is in the Super Bowl for the first time as a head coach. And he's gotten there with a coaching staff that's as diverse as one will see in the NFL.

All three of his coordinators -- defensive coordinator Todd Bowles, offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich and special teams coordinator Keith Armstrong -- are Black. So is assistant head coach and run game coordinator Harold Goodwin.

Additionally, the Buccaneers are the only team that has two full-time assistant coaches that are women in assistant defensive line coach Lori Locust and assistant strength and conditioning coach Maral Javadifar. Tampa Bay's front office also includes Jacqueline Davidson, the team's director of football research, and Carly Helfand, a scouting assistant.

""I don't know if I've ever been part of anything like this,"" Leftwich said in a session with reporters Monday in the lead up to Sunday's Super Bowl LV between the Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs.

""This is unique. This is different. This is not the norm. This is not the norm of how this league and how the coaching staff looks across the league. It's a blessing that BA has his view that he has. I just hope no one believes that he's just giving us anything. If you know him, you know he's not giving you anything. You've got to earn everything that you pretty much get from him or his view of you.""

For Arians, ""inclusivity and diversity are great ways to teach,"" he explained when talking to reporters last week.

It's that kind of philosophy that in October led tennis legend and activist Billie Jean King, founder of the Women's Sports Foundation, to present Arians with the Champion for Equality Award for his work fostering inclusion and commitment to growing participation for girls in football.

""I couldn't think of anyone more deserving,"" King said at the time.

Arians said Monday about his staff: ""If you can teach, you can coach. As far as the women, it was time. It was time for that door to be knocked down and allow them because they've been putting in time, and they're very, very qualified. The ones we have are overly qualified.

""As far as race, that was not by design. Those are the best coaches I know. But to hear voices in a staff meeting that aren't the same, don't look alike, but they all have input, you get better output.""

Last year, San Francisco 49ers offensive assistant Katie Sowers made history when she became the first woman to coach in a Super Bowl. A year later, Locust and Javadifar now have the chance of being the first female coaches in the sport to help win the Vince Lombardi Trophy.

""You have to understand this is not something that's done because of checking boxes,"" Locust said.

""It's not done because of an initiative. It's who BA is and has always been. I think that's why it works so well here is that he's gathered individuals that he knows will benefit the organization. He has talent. He has people he can trust around him. And it doesn't matter what we look like. He's put together that staff because it's people that he feels will help the team win.

""Clearly, that combination has worked. ... And hopefully it will set an example for the rest of the league to kind of take notice and stop being maybe so narrow in their candidate search."""

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, is planning to deliver an ultimatum to House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy on Greene this week, a source familiar tells CNN. Hoyer is expected to tell McCarthy that Republicans have 72 hours to strip Greene of her committee assignments, or Democrats will bring the issue to the House floor.

CNN has reached out to Hoyer's office to ask for more details. Politico first reported the ultimatum from the House majority leader.

The move by Democrats could set a risky precedent as they go after a sitting member of Congress over views expressed before serving as an elected official -- and one that has the potential to someday be used against the party by Republicans.

The House Rules Committee is slated to meet Wednesday to approve a rule for a resolution to kick Greene off the House Education and Labor Committee and the Budget Committee.

The rule would govern the procedures for floor debate ahead of the full House's consideration of the resolution to strip Greene of her committee assignments. It marks the first official step by House Democrats to oust Greene from her assignments.

One senior Democratic aide told CNN Monday that one of the concerns heading into a potential vote is the precedent it sets.

Even though members agree that Greene's embrace of conspiracy theories, her past comments and actions and current lack of remorse are all reason for McCarthy to strip her of her committee assignments, some worry bringing it to the floor for a vote could potentially cause Republicans to deploy the same recourse against Democratic members if they control the House in the future.

Greene herself warned Monday that the precedent could be used against Democrats in the future. ""If Democrats remove me from my committees, I can assure them that the precedent they are setting will be used extensively against members on their side once we regain the majority after the 2022 elections,"" she tweeted.

It's still possible McCarthy could ultimately make the call and save the House from having to hold the vote. But despite the ultimatum, he is not yet tipping his hand on how he will handle Greene, and an aide told CNN that he needs to speak with the congresswoman first.

""They need to have a person-to-person conversation,"" a McCarthy spokesman said. The two are expected talk this week , but it's still not clear when.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the House is voting at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday and Greene and McCarthy are likely to meet around the time of votes, though the exact timing is uncertain.

Last week, a spokesman for the House Republican leader called comments from Greene ""deeply disturbing"" after CNN's KFile reported that Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress.

The move from Hoyer to deliver an ultimatum suggests that Democratic leadership wants to give McCarthy time to act on Greene independently before pursuing a resolution on the House floor.

""It is my hope and expectation that Republicans will do the right thing and hold Rep. Greene accountable, and we will not need to consider this resolution. But we are prepared to do so if necessary,"" Hoyer said in a statement Monday.

In the past, stripping members of their committees was a call leadership of the same party made. House Speaker John Boehner had kicked Rep. Tim Huelskamp off of the House Agriculture Committee after he repeatedly voted against the farm bill, and McCarthy had pulled Rep. Steve King , a Republican from Iowa, from his committees, after King made inflammatory comments.

But, voting on the floor -- while it is allowed under House rules -- is a significant step.

Most House Republicans have remained silent over Greene's comments, even as Democrats have expressed growing outrage, but the congresswoman hasn't escaped criticism from all members of her party.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, without naming the congresswoman, slammed Greene's embrace of ""loony lies and conspiracy theories"" in a short but pointed statement Monday night.

""Loony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""Somebody who's suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.'s airplane is not living in reality. This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families or the robust debates on substance that can strengthen our party.""

Greene tweeted a response to the statement minutes later, saying, ""The real cancer for the Republican Party is weak Republicans who only know how to lose gracefully. This is why we are losing our country.""

The Georgia Republican has also faced backlash over recently resurfaced comments about the Parkland school shooting.

Greene appears to now be attempting to walk back some of those views.

During an interview with One America News on Monday, Greene said that she does not think such shootings are fake.

""These are not red flag incidents; they are not fake. And it's terrible the loss that these families go through and their friends as well. And it should never happen. And it doesn't have to happen if we would protect our children properly,"" she said.

31 Florida counties agree to provide Spanish-language elections materials after years-long dispute,"(CNN) Nearly half of Florida's counties have agreed to provide Spanish-language assistance and materials to voters after a years-long legal battle.

Several Latino civil rights groups announced on Monday a settlement with 31 counties in a 2018 federal lawsuit centered on allegations that elected officials were disenfranchising the votes of Spanish-speakers in the Sunshine State.

The lawsuit claimed the counties were essentially running English-only elections, which is a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Section 4E of the act states that individuals who were taught in an American school where the primary language is not English, such as Puerto Ricans, can't be denied the right to vote just because they cannot understand English.

Since the lawsuit was filed, state officials established new rules requiring all 67 counties to offer Spanish-language ballots but advocacy groups have argued that those rules were not enough.

Under the settlement, 31 counties will be required to provide more robust assistance, including Spanish versions of their mail-in ballots and secrecy envelopes for all of their elections, Spanish translations on their elections websites, Spanish signs and a hotline to assist Spanish-speakers if bilingual staff members are not available, said Kira Romero-Craft, an attorney at LatinoJustice PRLDEF, which is one of the groups behind the lawsuit.

Those counties are: Alachua, Bay, Brevard, Citrus, Clay, Columbia, Duval, Escambia, Flagler, Hernando, Highlands, Indian River, Jackson, Lake, Leon, Levy, Manatee, Marion, Martin, Monroe, Okaloosa, Okeechobee, Pasco, Putnam, St. Johns, St. Lucie, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, Sumter, Taylor, and Wakulla. The county of Charlotte, which was named in the lawsuit, did not join the settlement.

""The right to vote is an empty right if you can't vote in a language you understand and we are very pleased with the settlement that was reached,"" said Stuart Naifeh, an attorney with voters' rights group Demos, which represented the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs have said the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey found that just over 30,000 Puerto Rican adults in the 32 counties are not proficient in English. That survey took place between 2011 and 2015 and Florida's seen a marked increase in its Puerto Rican population.

One of the Puerto Ricans who fled is Marta Valentina Rivera Madera, a 73-year-old woman who is the named plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Rivera Madera had lived all her life in Puerto Rico when she decided to move to Gainesville, Florida, in 2017. Her home suffered extensive damage when Hurricane Maria hit the island and she struggled to find medicines to treat her diabetes, she said.

While Rivera Madera has been taking English lessons, she said she's happy that once again she will feel comfortable voting without assistance.

""We will not have to rely in others or bring anyone to translate,"" Rivera Madera said in Spanish. ""I think it's great that we are now going to be capable of doing this ourselves.""

Naifeh said the groups have seen that the counties have been largely following the state's new rules and were ""willing to commit to continuing to stay in compliance."""
SpaceX announces first-ever all-civilian space flight crew,"Austin, Texas (CNN Business) Jared Isaacman, an entrepreneur behind a payment processing startup, is funding a multimillion trip to space aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which could be the first-ever orbital flight crewed entirely by non-astronauts.

Isaacman, 37, said he will command the mission, which is slated for late-2021 and will see the spacecraft make a ""multi-day"" trip into Earth's orbit, according to a press release. Isaacman has purchased three additional seats aboard the mission. The seats will be donated to a St. Jude Children's Research Hospital ""ambassador,"" and a member of the public who enters for a chance to join the trip.

The St. Jude ambassador has already been selected, Isaacman said. He did not disclose any details of their identity beyond saying it would be a woman and a front-line healthcare worker who's ""committed to helping kids beat cancer.""

Supreme Court delays oral arguments on border wall and asylum rule,"(CNN) The Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to postpone oral arguments in significant cases regarding former President Donald Trump's border wall and a controversial asylum policy.

Earlier this week, President Joe Biden's Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to delay the arguments. The Justice Department said Biden has directed a ""pause in construction"" so that the administration can undertake an assessment ""of the legality of the funding and contracting methods used to construct the wall."" The American Civil Liberties Union, Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition asked the Supreme Court last year to block the construction the wall.

Only hours into his presidency, Biden took an immediate shot at one of his predecessor's key legacies when he signed a proclamation calling for border wall construction to end. The administration's filing Monday showed how the Biden Justice Department is moving to bring building to a halt, as it reviews the former administration's actions.

The Biden administration is also beginning to put lawsuits launched under Trump that were intended to acquire private land for the purpose of border wall construction on hold, according to court filings and attorneys.

In a separate case, the court agreed to a Justice Department request to suspend oral arguments in a case on the Trump-era policy requiring non-Mexican migrants to remain in Mexico until their next court dates in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security recently stopped enrollments in the program , marking a step toward ending it entirely. That case is scheduled for March 1. Thousands of migrants subject to the policy continue to wait in Mexico in dangerous and deplorable conditions.

Organizations challenging the so-called ""Remain in Mexico"" policy in the lawsuit include the Innovation Law Lab, along with other immigrant right groups.

The Biden administration is set to reverse scores of Trump administration policies. In the short term, Elizabeth Prelogar, Biden's acting solicitor general, is expected to play a key role managing a wave of potential reversals concerning issues such as immigration, health care, and religion.

Border wall land grab efforts dropped

During Trump's presidency, dozens of lawsuits had been filed to take private land for the purpose of building additional barriers on the border, leaving some landowners to juggle legal challenges and the coronavirus pandemic . But with Biden's wall executive order, those attempts are now on pause.

In one court document, filed on January 22, the Justice Department asked for a continuance in a land seizure case for ""at least 60 days,"" citing Biden's Inauguration Day proclamation that in part directs a review of funds siphoned off for wall construction.

In another case, the Justice Department said that it will be dismissing a motion for immediate possession of land, according to Ricardo de Anda, an attorney for Guillermo Caldera, who lives in Laredo, Texas, and whose property was at risk of being taken.

""We are heartened by the court taking judicial notice of the Executive Order signed by President Biden halting construction of Trump's border wall, in ordering the government to notify the court and the parties as to whether it intends to proceed with the taking of Texan properties,"" de Anda said in a statement. Two other cases are expecting similar motions to be filed, de Anda said.

Ricky Garza, a staff attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, a legal advocacy group representing landowners in land seizure cases, told CNN property owners are in a ""holding pattern.""

""There's been movements towards a pause and that's positive,"" Garza said. ""What needs to happen now is the administration reviews and dismisses all these cases.""

Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, a critic of Trump's border wall, said last Thursday that the administration had notified his office that the US Army Corps of Engineers was pausing real estate acquisitions in compliance with Biden's executive order.

""Today, I received notification that in compliance with President Biden's executive order, real estate acquisition activities such as surveys and negotiations with landowners have been placed on hold in coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,"" Cuellar said in a statement.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

The Army Corps of Engineers, which provides direction and oversight of border projects, ""has suspended work on all border infrastructure projects for DoD and DHS until further notice,"" said Raini Brunson, a spokesperson for the agency.

Dror Ladin, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project, praised the decision to delay the Supreme Court oral arguments, but said more needs to be done.

""It's a good start that the Biden administration is not rushing to defend Trump's illegal wall in court, but just hitting the brakes isn't enough. Trump's wall devastated border communities, the environment, and tribal sites,"" Ladin said. ""It's time for the Biden administration to step up for border communities, and commit to mitigating environmental damage and tearing down the wall.""

Trump sped up lawsuits

The Trump administration accelerated the filing of cases over the last four years in its efforts to build additional barriers on the southern border. At the heart of those cases were landowners, some of whom backed the wall and others who criticized it.

Joseph Hein, a landowner in Laredo whose property was being reviewed to build on, described the last four years as being in a ""state of limbo.""

""I was basically at the mercy of them giving me the information that they wanted to give me, and basically the information that they were giving me was nothing,"" Hein said, referring to the Army Corps of Engineers and Customs and Border Protection.

Biden's proclamation ended Trump's national emergency declaration, which allowed the previous administration to dip into Pentagon funds, and calls for the review of contracts.

The changes to border wall construction made under Biden so far have also prompted questions in ongoing border wall cases. Shortly after the release of Biden's proclamation, Judge Haywood Gilliam directed the parties in an ongoing wall lawsuit to provide an update by February 16.

Millions of Ford vehicles will run Google's Android operating system starting in 2023,"New York (CNN Business) Ford and Google announced a six-year strategic partnership in which they will collaborate on new technologies and install Google's Android operating system as the primary system in its infotainment screens in millions of Ford and Lincoln cars and trucks starting in 2023.

Android's operating system will enable drivers to access Google Maps for in-vehicle navigation and Google's Voice Assistant for handling voice commands in the car without the use of an Android phone. Ford vehicles have come with the automaker's proprietary Sync system since 2007, which has been featured across its portfolio. It is not clear whether Ford will continue to use the Sync name on this new system.

Starting in 2023, Ford cars will also begin offering an in-car version of the Google Play Store to download apps for things like music, audiobooks and podcasts.

In addition, Google will also be Ford's preferred provider for cloud data storage, executives from Ford and Google said. Ford will also use Google's artificial intelligence and data analytics capabilities to better interpret the data it collects from vehicles and its own operations to improve upon things like customer service, manufacturing and marketing.

General Motors GM recently announced a similar arrangement with Microsoft in which Microsoft will be the cloud storage provider for GM and Cruise, the autonomous car company majority owned by GM. Ford and Google did not specifically say if Google's cloud computing systems would be used for autonomous vehicles, as in the GM and Microsoft deal.

"American jobs won't return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024, CBO says","New York (CNN Business) The number of employed Americans won't return to its pre-pandemic level until 2024, but the broad economy is expected to fully recover by the middle of this year, according to a Congressional Budget Office report issued Monday.

The projection shows just how long the job market still has to go to heal after suffering the steepest loss on record in April , when 20.5 million jobs evaporated and the unemployment rate shot up to 14.7% in a single month.

It could pressure the White House and Capitol Hill to speed the passage of another relief bill, as well as an economic recovery package. President Joe Biden is already facing resistance in Congress to the $1.9 trillion rescue proposal he unveiled last month. He is scheduled to meet Monday afternoon with a group of GOP senators, who have put together a $618 billion counteroffer . The President also plans to release a recovery package later this month.

The nation's recovery remains on shaky footing, with the economy adding back only about half of the positions that disappeared. A whopping 140,000 jobs were lost in December , the first monthly loss since April. The forecast for the January report, which will be released Friday, calls for only 50,000 positions to be added. The unemployment rate is expected to remain flat at 6.7%, where it has been stuck since November.

Labor market conditions will continue to improve, according to the CBO's 10-year outlook. The economic expansion will prompt many people to rejoin the labor force, which includes both those working and those looking for jobs. It should return to its pre-pandemic size next year.

The unemployment rate will gradually decline and the number of employed Americans will fully recover to pre-pandemic level in 2024, the agency estimates.

It is projecting the unemployment rate to be 4.2% in 2024-25. It was 3.5% last February, before the pandemic hit.

The economy will recover more quickly

While the labor market recovers, so will the overall economy. After all, America runs on consumer spending so the more consumers are working and spending their wages, the better.

The CBO predicts America's real gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, will grow at a pace of 4.6% in 2021. By that forecast, the economy will be back at its pre-pandemic size by the middle of the year.

Although 4.6% growth sounds pretty good, the economy could use a jolt after US GDP decreased 3.5% in 2020 -- its worst decline since 1946. It was the first decline in GDP since the financial crisis. That final report card for 2020 made one thing clear: the economy needs more help.

It's important to note that the CBO report doesn't include President Joe Biden's proposed stimulus plan, which could give the economy a much-needed sugar rush.

The pandemic put an end to America's longest economic expansion in history last spring as business shuttered and the nation came to a standstill. Despite rapid growth in the second half of last year, the US economy still hasn't fully recovered. According to the CBO it will take until 2025 for America to close its output gap, which is the term economists use to describe the gap between actual GDP growth and potential GDP growth.

Over the next five years, real GDP will grow at an average of 2.6%, according to the report released Monday, before surpassing its potential in 2025. Between 2026 and 2031, real GDP is expected to grow by 1.6% on average.

More stimulus will speed the recovery

Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal could speed the economic recovery up further, according to a report from Moody's Analytics. Even as the sheer size of the bill is causing some lawmakers and exports to recoil.

""Today's CBO report, in line with other recent estimates, shows that the economy is on its way to recovering,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan watchdog group.

""More funding is warranted to assist those out of work because of the pandemic, prevent state and local government layoffs, boost economic demand, prevent a decline in household incomes and end this pandemic once and for all. But it shouldn't take $1.9 trillion to fill a $400 billion or $800 billion hole,"" she added.

But Moody's predicts GDP could jump by more than 7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter of this year and by almost 8% for the full year. In 2022, the economy could post an additional gain of almost 4%.

At that pace, 7.5 million jobs would be created this year and another 2.5 million next year, allowing the economy to recover all the jobs lost. The unemployment rate would be between 4% and 4.5%.

Biden's plan would speed up the recovery by about a year, compared to no additional fiscal support, according to Moody's.

Left-leaning activists are already using the CBO report to push the President not to compromise with Republicans and shrink his proposal.

""This report makes clear that much more needs to be done to get people back on the job,"" said Zac Petkanas, senior advisor of Invest in America, an advocacy group. ""We can't afford half-measures that nibble around the edges. Our nation requires big, bold public investment now to get people back to work as soon as possible."""
New York City's JFK airport cancels all flights for today due to storm,"The strong onshore winds from the powerful nor’easter currently pounding the East Coast may bring the highest water levels into New York City since Superstorm Sandy in 2012, which could overtop the seawall. Storm surge from the system has been pushing water levels 2 to 3 feet above normal this morning, and that should increase as the winds pick up more in the afternoon and evening.

“The city should see the highest water levels tonight in the run-up to high tide,” which occurs around midnight local time, according to Bill Goodman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Upton, NY.

The forecast calls for water levels to reach 8.4 feet tonight, very near the 8.5 foot level where water washes over the Battery Park seawall and begins to flood the Boardwalk, according to NOAA data.

“I’d give it a one in three chance to overtop the seawall,” Goodman told CNN on Monday afternoon, “it is certainly something we will be watching for tonight.”

The current water level forecast of 8.4 feet would put the high tide just outside the top-10 of all time, but the highest since Superstorm Sandy, which set the all-time high water mark at the Battery, 14.2 feet."
Man charged with attacking officer who suffered concussion in US Capitol riot,"(CNN) Federal prosecutors have filed charges against an alleged US Capitol rioter who was one of the first people to breach barricades outside the complex, saying he attacked the police line, causing an officer to suffer a concussion.

The man, Ryan Stephen Samsel, was charged with forcibly assaulting a police officer, attempting to obstruct a police officer and obstructing an official proceeding, according to court documents unsealed Monday.

Authorities arrested Samsel on Saturday in Pennsylvania, according to the Department of Justice.

Ryan Stephen Samsel has been charged in connection with the January 6 US Capitol riot. Investigators cited this image as depicting Samsel. The officer's face has been obscured by prosecutors.

Investigators reviewed video footage in which they identified Samsel, who they described as wearing a jean jacket and red MAGA hat. The video, which police say was recorded at approximately 12:50 p.m., shows one of the first clashes with police at barricades outside the Capitol complex on January 6.

""In the process of pushing the barricades to the ground, SAMSEL and others knocked over (a) U.S. Capitol Police Officer ... as the crowd lifted the barricades up and pushed toward the Capitol, causing (the officer's) head to hit the stairs behind her, resulting in a loss of consciousness.""

Impeachment: House Democrats to accuse Trump of intentionally inciting rioters with months-long campaign,"(CNN) House impeachment managers are preparing a case for next week's Senate impeachment trial to argue former President Donald Trump acted intentionally in a months-long efforts to subvert the will of the voters that incited the US Capitol riot, as well as why it's constitutional for convicting Trump after he's left office, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.

The House's pretrial impeachment brief on Tuesday will lay the legal groundwork for a case in which the managers plan to illustrate the horrors of the January 6 attack on the Capitol in visceral detail and to tie the carnage back to the Trump's words and actions, sources say.

The House impeachment team plans to argue the riot was the result of an intentional effort months in the making. They intend to show how Trump repeatedly claimed that the election would be stolen from him before November 3, then unleashed a flurry of disinformation as part of his ""stop the steal"" campaign to try to overturn the election result and question the validity of President Joe Biden's win , which culminated in Trump's actions on January 6 inciting the rioters who attacked the Capitol.

The House managers are expected provide a detailed legal analysis in their pre-trial legal brief, due at 10 a.m. ET Tuesday, about the constitutionality of charging Trump with incitement of insurrection, why he should be disqualified from holding future office and why it's constitutional to convict Trump as a former President, in an effort to rebut what's emerged as the primary reason Senate Republicans have cited to acquit Trump.

Trump's legal team is also scheduled to file its response to the impeachment trial summons on Tuesday at noon ET after five of Trump's lawyers left his team on Saturday amid a dispute about legal strategy and whether to argue baseless claims of widespread election fraud.

Adding to some of the friction that resulted in the former President parting ways with Butch Bowers, who was expected to be a lead attorney, was Trump's opposition to the cost. Bowers wanted to charge him $3 million for expenses related to the upcoming trial, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.

Trump hired two new lawyers, David Schoen and Bruce Castor, on Sunday, and his team is expected to argue that trying a former president is unconstitutional.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said it would be a ""disservice"" to the former President's defense to focus on baseless claims that the election was ""stolen.""

""It's really not material,"" Cornyn said. ""The articles of impeachment are like an indictment in a criminal case, so that would be the issue before the Senate. As much as there might be a temptation to bring in other matters, I think it would be a disservice to the President's own defense to get bogged down in things that really aren't before the Senate.""

The House impeachment managers are still considering whether to call witnesses as part of their case, one of the key looming questions that will dictate how long the trial will last. That effort is bumping up against a desire from both Democratic and Republican senators to quickly conclude the trial within a matter of days to keep the Senate's focus on taking up Covid relief legislation and confirming Biden's nominees.

The question of witnesses could ultimately be determined by whether there are any willing to step forward voluntarily -- avoiding any delays over executive privilege -- who can speak to Trump's mindset in the hours leading up to the riot and as they were unfolding, when there were urgent requests coming from Capitol Hill to call in the National Guard to the Capitol.

The briefs due Tuesday are the first of several pre-trial responses that the House managers and Trump lawyers will file with the Senate ahead of the impeachment trial's arguments, which are scheduled to begin on February 9.

House case will draw on video evidence

The path to conviction for the House managers has all but evaporated in the Senate, where 45 Senate Republicans voted with a procedural effort to dismiss the trial on constitutional grounds, leaving Democrats well short of the two-thirds required for conviction. But that won't stop the House impeachment team from making the emotional case to the senators -- and the broader public -- during the trial to argue Trump inspired a deadly riot that was a direct attempt to overturn the election result.

House impeachment managers plan to draw on material from the hours of videos that have been posted to social media sites to show how the Capitol was attacked, how the rioters were targeting Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- and how they were motivated by Trump's words and actions on January 6.

The case they make is shaping up to be starkly different than what the House presented in its 2020 impeachment trial of Trump, which drew on hours of complicated House testimony about how Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and withheld security aide from Kiev.

This time, the case against Trump played out before lawmakers' eyes, when they were forced to flee the House and Senate chambers while rioters encircled them.

There's plenty of material for the House managers to draw on to show the destruction the caused by the deadly riot. That includes video from social media websites like the alternative conservative platform Parler illustrating both how the rioters were motivated by Trump and how they attacked US Capitol Police officers and threatened officials including Pelosi and Pence.

Since Trump's impeachment last month for a single article of ""incitement of insurrection,"" the House impeachment managers have gained new evidence from the rioters themselves -- who have told federal investigators in court filings they were inspired by Trump to storm the Capitol as they sought to disrupt the certification of Biden's win in November.

The House's argument is expected to focus on Trump's speech at the Ellipse on January 6 before the crowd marched to the Capitol and quickly overwhelmed an outmatched police force, arguing Trump incited the riot. But the House managers plan to go beyond just the events of that day, showing how Trump's lies about election fraud while he sought to subvert the will of the voters fed the lies that fueled the insurrectionists.

In the impeachment article, the House specifically cited Trump's January call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger before Congress certified Biden's win, in which Trump pushed him to ""find"" enough votes to make Trump the winner.

A constitutional argument

When the House impeached Trump on January 13, he was still president. But now that he's left office, most of the Senate Republicans have argued that trying an ex-president is unconstitutional. But the House will have its first chance to push back on the constitutional claims in its brief on Tuesday, and that's expected to be a focus of the written brief, sources say.

The House team is expected to draw on the precedent of a Senate impeachment trial for a former official -- the Senate tried Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876 after he resigned ahead of the House's impeachment -- as well as argue that presidents cannot get away with crimes in their final days in office to avoid punishment and then run again.

The legal argument is also expected to explain the House's legal case for charging Trump with incitement of insurrection, as well as a discussion about why he should be disqualified from holding office again, which the Senate could do if it convicts Trump.

During the last impeachment trial, Trump's team filed a seven-page rebuttal to the two articles of impeachment, arguing Trump's impeachment was a ""brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election.""

Trump's new legal team is likely to argue in its filing due Tuesday that trying an ex-president is unconstitutional. The trial of an ex-president has never been done before -- this will only be the fourth Senate impeachment trial of a president in US history -- and several GOP senators have argued that Chief Justice John Roberts' absence from the trial casts doubts on its constitutionality, when the Constitution says the chief justice shall preside when the president is on trial.

A source close to the case said the document from Trump's attorneys will address four or five major themes, but their argument that the trial is unconstitutional will be the biggest.

But the Trump response to the trial summons could also shed light on whether his team will wade into conspiracy theories about election fraud during the trial. A person familiar with the departures of Trump's initial impeachment lawyers told CNN Saturday that Trump wanted the attorneys to argue there was mass election fraud and that the election was stolen from him, rather than focus on the legality of convicting a president after he's left office.

While the source said Trump's claims of a rigged election are not expected to be a ""focal point"" of his attorneys' legal brief, that of course does not mean it won't be mentioned -- and won't turn into a lightning rod. Trump still believes the election was stolen from him and clearly sees that as part of his defense.

Coronavirus committee launches investigation into meatpackers and OSHA,"New York (CNN Business) A panel of House representatives is launching an investigation into how major meat processors and OSHA handled coronavirus outbreaks at meatpacking facilities.

The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, chaired by Representative James Clyburn, said Monday that it has sent out letters to Tyson, Smithfield and JBS USA, along with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, asking for more information about their response to worker illnesses.

""Public reports indicate that meatpacking companies ... have refused to take basic precautions to protect their workers,"" Clyburn wrote in letters to the meatpacking companies.

"Anti-vaxxers briefly shut down Dodger Stadium vaccination site over weekend, police say","(CNN) A few dozen protesters carrying anti-vaccination signs briefly shut down Los Angeles' largest Covid-19 vaccination site over the weekend.

The Los Angeles Fire Department temporarily closed the entrance to the Dodger Stadium vaccination site Saturday for 55 minutes, Andrea Garcia, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti, told CNN on Monday.

Hundreds of cars were waiting in line for the vaccine as anti-vaccination protesters held up messages outside, CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported.

Video from the affiliate showed one sign that said, ""LA Better Dodge The Vaxxx""; another read ""Covid=Scam.""

Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Officer Drake Madison told CNN that the protesters were ""anti-vaxxers."" The gathering was peaceful and no arrests were made, he said.

At-home Covid-19 test to ramp up production with $231.8 million federal contract,"(CNN) The Biden administration announced on Monday that the US Department of Defense and US Department of Health and Human Services are working with Australian company Ellume to provide more of its fully at-home Covid-19 tests to the United States.

""Ellume has been ramping up manufacturing and will ship 100,000 test kits per month to the US from February through July,"" Andy Slavitt, the White House Covid-19 senior adviser, said during a White House briefing on Monday. ""That's good but it's obviously not where we'll need to be.""

The award announced Monday provides $231.8 million to Ellume USA for onshore production capacity of the at-home tests for the United States. Slavitt said this will scale up production to more than 19 million test kits per month by the end of the year, 8.5 million of which are guaranteed to the US government.

Slavitt said on Monday the test can detect Covid-19 with 95% accuracy within roughly 15 minutes.

The GameStop frenzy is moving fast. Catch up here,"New York (CNN Business) If you thought the GameStop drama was over, think again.

ICYMI: Last week, a tense showdown played out on Wall Street. It was a David vs. Goliath tale in which a band of amateur investors on Reddit took on Wall Street pros by inflating the share price of GameStop (and other securities).

The mass buying spree led to huge gains for some in the Reddit crowd who got in early. Hedge funds, meanwhile, lost billions of dollars on their short positions.

While GameStop and other Reddit faves surged, the broader stock market had its worst week since October. And traders were bracing for more volatility on Monday.

Here's what you need to know.

Silver is the new GameStop?

GameStop, the struggling mall-based retailer, was up 600% for the week as of Friday, so anyone thinking of getting in on the rally now would be (rightly) wary of buying high only to have the stock crash. That means they're hunting for deals elsewhere.

Enter silver.

Last week, people on WallStreetBets, the Reddit community fueling the rally, set their sights on silver and the iShares Silver Trust ETF (that's ""exchange-traded fund"" — a basket of securities that trade like a stock). Some promoted it as a way to hurt big banks they believe are artificially suppressing prices.

On Monday, silver prices jumped 13% to an eight-year high.

""The #silversqueeze is a rage against the machine,"" tweeted Tyler Winklevoss. (Yes, that Winklevoss .)

However, it's not clear who the Reddit users are — nor whether their market moves match the claims online. In fact, some posts on WallStreetBets late Sunday and Monday suggested their movement is being co-opted by hedge funds and there is no coordinated effort in the silver market.

""The Silver Squeeze is a hedge-fund coordinated attack so they can keep fighting the $GME fight,"" one thread was titled.

Who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?

No one knows.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, an outspoken defender of consumer rights and frequent critic of big banks and hedge funds, is calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate.

""We actually don't know who all the players are in all this — whether there's big money on both sides,"" Warren said on CNN on Sunday. ""That's why we need an SEC investigation.""

She called Robinhood's decision to flip the switch and prevent users from buying GameStop in the middle of a trading session ""just wrong.""

What exactly happened with Robinhood?

Last week, the trading app used by millions of everyday investors temporarily blocked trades on red-hot Reddit darlings like Gamestop and about a dozen others, prompting a massive backlash.

The reason, Robinhood said, was not because it was bowing to pressure from big Wall Street firms, as many on social media accused it of doing.

The surge in trading was simply so huge that Robinhood, a seven-year-old startup, was facing a cash crunch.

Why? When you buy a stock on Robinhood, you might think that it instantly becomes yours when you tap ""buy."" But behind the scenes, there's more going on.

All trades have to go through a clearinghouse — these are obscure intermediary institutions that mitigate risk between buyers and sellers.

As the Reddit frenzy grew, it triggered the the risk-reduction mechanisms managed by clearinghouses, meaning Robinhood had to find emergency cash to be able to continue executing trades.

Robinhood's CEO Vlad Tenev said the $3 billion ask was ""an order of magnitude"" larger than what Robinhood is typically required by the National Securities Clearing Corporation to put up. It had to tap its existing investors for a $1 billion cash infusion.

On Monday, Robinhood raised yet another $2.4 billion from shareholders. The $3.4 billion total is more than the company has raised in its entire existence, according to the Wall Street Journal

The app eased some restrictions on Friday, after taking a PR beating online. On Sunday it said it would further lift restrictions on stock trades — but not entirely. For instance, Robinhood users are able to buy only one share of GameStop and 10 shares of AMC.

Who's this Melvin I keep hearing about?

That's Melvin Capital, a premier Wall Street hedge fund that just lost a lot of money.

Melvin was a major short-seller of GameStop, meaning it had a sizable bet that the shares would drop. So when GameStop's stock shot up more than 1,600%, it got burned.

Melvin lost some 53% of investments in January, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business.

The loss is so staggering, and so potentially destabilizing, that other hedge funds, led by Citadel, provided Melvin with a more-than-$2-billion bailout."
"ACLU, for first time in its 101-year history, elects an African American as its president","(CNN) Deborah Archer, a clinical law professor at New York University, has been elected as the new president of the American Civil Liberties Union -- the first Black person to hold the position.

The ACLU made the announcement Monday, calling Archer ""an established civil rights attorney, scholar, and teacher.""

Congratulations to Deborah Archer, newly elected president of the ACLU national board! pic.twitter.com/DDGGJk6mTR — ACLU (@ACLU) February 1, 2021

In addition to her professorship, Archer is the co-faculty director at NYU's Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law , and the director of the Civil Rights Clinic at NYU School of Law.

Archer has been a part of the ACLU for years, beginning her career as a legal fellow in the ACLU Racial Justice Program, the organization stated. She's been a member of the board since 2009 and a general counsel since 2017.

""After beginning my career as an ACLU fellow, it is an honor to come full circle and now lead the organization as board president,"" Archer said in a statement . ""The ACLU has proven itself as an invaluable voice in the fight for civil rights in the last four years of the Trump era, and we are better positioned than ever to face the work ahead.""

Joe Biden just made his first big mistake as president,"(CNN) There's a golden rule in politics: Don't mess with a member in his or her home state unless you want trouble.

Which is why it's more than a little perplexing that Vice President Kamala Harris gave an interview to a local West Virginia TV station late last week expressly designed to put pressure on West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) to support the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus plan

""To your point in West Virginia, one in seven families is describing their household as being hungry, one in six can't pay their rent, and one in four small businesses are closing permanently or have already closed, so it's a big issue in West Virginia and across the country,"" Harris told WSAZ . ""And that's why the president and I are offering the American Rescue Plan.""

Which -- BREAKING NEWS! -- Manchin didn't like.

""I saw [the interview], I couldn't believe it. No one called me [about it],"" Manchin told WSAZ over the weekend . ""We're going to try to find a bipartisan pathway forward, but we need to work together. That's not a way of working together.""

(Harris, it's worth noting, also did an interview with a local station in Arizona to pressure Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on the same bill, according to Punchbowl News .)

Made aware of Manchin's annoyance, the White House reached out to the West Virginia Democrat over the weekend to smooth the waters, according to CNN's Manu Raju . It's unclear whether the outreach calmed Manchin down.

""We've been in touch with Sen. Manchin, as we have been for many weeks and will continue to be moving forward,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. Psaki declined to say on Monday whether Harris' interview was designed specifically to apply pressure on Manchin.

Regardless, it's a weird, rookie mistake for this administration to make. Both Biden and Harris spent time in the Senate and should understand how a move like this would be perceived by Manchin -- as a not-at-all-subtle threat for him to get in line (or else.)

That urging is the sort of thing that works far better in a phone call -- or a White House meeting. No senator is going to like the vice president (of their own party!) doing an interview with a local news station in their state to say that this piece of legislation that they are unsure about is actually really, really good thing for their state. Not one.

Manchin has so far resisted taking a position on the stimulus package. He told CNN that he had concerns about the price tag , but added: ""We're gonna try to make Joe Biden successful.""

(Interestingly, West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice advocated for Congress to go big with a stimulus package during an interview on Monday morning with CNN's Poppy Harlow . ""Trying to be per se fiscally responsible at this point in time ... if we actually throw away some money right now, so what?"" said Justice.)

Why play hardball so quickly? Because the Biden White House is almost certainly going to need to pass the Covid-19 stimulus bill through reconciliation -- a legislative tactic that would allow Democrats to move the package to the floor (and to passage) with a simple majority rather than 60 votes. (Read this for more on reconciliation.)

But in order for that to work, Democrats need all 50 of their senators to support the legislation. If that happened, Harris would be able to break the tie in Democrats' favor.

Look, Manchin may well wind up finding a way to be for the $1.9 trillion package. But, this move certainly doesn't help him get there.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, expressed optimism that his side would get there.

""All of us will have differences of opinions, this is a $1.9 trillion dollar bill, I have differences and concerns about this bill, but at the end of the day we are going to support the President of the United States,"" he said on ABC on Sunday

That could, in theory, offer the White House a way out if they don't believe they can count on Manchin to vote for the $1.9 trillion proposal. It's not at all clear they are willing to admit defeat on that, however.

What is clear is that the White House made a beginner's mistake by putting pressure on Manchin via the Harris interview. Something about catching more flies with honey than vinegar."
"Dustin Diamond, 'Saved by the Bell' star, dead at 44","(CNN) Dustin Diamond, who played the role of Screech on the popular 1990s high school comedy ""Saved by the Bell,"" died Monday after a recent cancer diagnosis, according to Diamond's manager, Roger Paul.

He was 44.

""He was diagnosed with this brutal, relentless form of malignant cancer only three weeks ago,"" Paul said in a statement he provided to CNN. ""In that time, it managed to spread rapidly throughout his system; the only mercy it exhibited was its sharp and swift execution. Dustin did not suffer. He did not have to lie submerged in pain. For that, we are grateful.""

At the time, his manager said his client's health was ""serious"" and that Diamond was undergoing further testing at a Florida hospital. He underwent his first round of chemotherapy days later.

An actor and stand-up comedian, Diamond found fame playing Samuel ""Screech"" Powers for more than a decade on the ""Saved by the Bell"" franchise.

The teen series was recently reimagined by the Peacock streaming service with some of the original stars, though not Diamond.

He stirred controversy with his 2009 book ""Behind the Bell,"" in which Diamond shared backstage stories about shooting the series with some of his accounts being less than flattering to his costars.

He also faced some legal troubles, serving three months in jail for stabbing a man during a 2014 altercation at a bar in Wisconsin.

The actor has appeared in a number of reality shows over the years, including ""Celebrity Fit Club,"" ""Celebrity Boxing 2"" and ""Celebrity Championship Wrestling.""

Diamond's ""Save by the Bell"" costars, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Mario Lopez and Tiffany Thiessen, paid tribute to the late actor on social media

""Deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Dustin Diamond, a true comedic genius,"" Gosselaar tweeted. ""My sincere condolences to his family and friends. Looking back at our time working together, I will miss those raw, brilliant sparks that only he was able to produce. A pie in your face, my comrade.""

Biden threatens to review sanctions on Myanmar following coup,"Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images

White House press secretary Jen Psaki touted the size of the President’s proposed American Rescue Plan ahead of an Oval Office meeting today between President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and 10 Republican lawmakers who have put forward a counterproposal.

She said that the president thinks the size of the package must be commensurate with the scope of the ongoing crisis “hence why he proposed a package that's $1.9 trillion.”

“There is obviously a big gap between 600 billion and $1.9 trillion. I don't believe any of us are mathematicians, but clearly the amount needs to be closer to what he proposed than smaller,” Psaki said, underscoring the administration’s view that the package should remain closer to what the President proposed than the GOP Senators counterproposal.

When asked if it was more important for the bill to be big or bipartisan, Pskai said the president believes he can have both, but added that there are a number of paths forward, including reconciliation.

“Well, I think the President believes we can, and there is a historic evidence that it is possible to take a number of paths, including through reconciliation, if that is the path that's pursued, and for the vote to be bipartisan. But it's important to him that he hears this group out on their concerns, on their ideas,” Psaki said at Monday’s White House press briefing.

The GOP proposal is less than one third the size of the President’s $1.9 trillion dollar proposal and does not include many of the provisions included in the American Rescue Plan, including additional aid for state, local and territorial governments.

Psaki said today’s meeting is an example of President Biden’s willingness to be bipartisan and will be an opportunity to have an exchange of ideas, but it will not be a forum for the President to make or accept an offer.

“He felt it was, you know, an effort to engage and engage on a bipartisan basis, and that's why he invited them to the White House today,” Psaki said. She added that Biden will engage with Democrats in the Oval Office as well.

At the top of her remarks at Monday’s briefing, Psaki touted reports from economists who have outlined what the American Rescue Plan could do to help the economy and also noted that West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, said that “he agrees going big with this is critical.”

Here’s a look at the key differences between Biden's proposal and the GOP counterproposal.

Meet the man who created Black History Month,"(CNN) February marks Black History Month, a federally recognized, nationwide celebration that calls on all Americans to reflect on the significant roles that African-Americans have played in shaping US history. But how did this celebration come to be -- and why does it happen in February?

The man behind the holiday

Carter G. Woodson, considered a pioneer in the study of African-American history, is given much of the credit for Black History Month.

The son of former slaves, Woodson spent his childhood working in coal mines and quarries. He received his education during the four-month term that was customary for black schools at the time.

At 19, having taught himself English fundamentals and arithmetic, Woodson entered high school, where he completed a four-year curriculum in two years. He graduated from Berea College in 1903 and went on to earn his master's degree in history from the University of Chicago. He later earned a doctorate from Harvard.

Black people in history: Little-known figures to know,"The son of two former slaves, Garrett Morgan had little more than a grade-school education.

But that didn’t stop the Ohio man from becoming an inventor with a rare gift for designing machines that saved people’s lives – including an early version of the traffic light.

As a teenager Morgan got a job repairing sewing machines, which led him to his first invention – a revamped sewing machine – and his first entrepreneurial venture: his own repair business.

Soon he was inventing other products, including a hair-straightener for African Americans. In 1916, he patented a “safety hood,” a personal breathing device that protected miners and firefighters from smoke and harmful gases. It became the precursor of the gas masks used by soldiers during WWI.

To avoid racist resistance to his product, Morgan hired a white actor to pose as the inventor while he wore the hood during presentations to potential buyers.

Later, after witnessing a car and buggy crash, Morgan was inspired to create a traffic light that had three signals: “stop,” “go,” and “stop in all directions,” to allow pedestrians to safely cross the street.

It also had a warning light – now today’s yellow light – to warn drivers they would soon have to stop. His traffic light was patented in 1923 and Morgan eventually sold its design for $40,000 to General Electric.

His legacy can be seen today at intersections across the country and the world."
White House cautions providers against holding back vaccine doses,"(CNN) The Biden administration expressed concern on Monday that health care providers could essentially be hoarding Covid-19 vaccine doses for second shots that could be administered for initial shots, warning that that ""should not happen.""

White House Covid-19 senior adviser Andy Slavitt cautioned there is concern that providers, amid a lack of predictability about supply, are holding back available doses.

""We believe that some health care providers are regularly holding back doses that are intended as first doses, and instead keeping them in reserve for second doses for patients. We want to be clear that we understand why health care providers have done that, but that it does not need to happen, and should not happen,"" Slavitt said at Monday's virtual press briefing.

But Slavitt predicted the ""efficiency of doses being administered will steadily improve.""

""On January 20, states had administered 46% of their inventory. Today, that number is 62%. We are focused on this every hour of every day,"" he said.

Robinhood CEO details 3:30 am call to put up $3 billion,"New York (CNN Business) Robinhood received a startling 3:30 am call from its clearinghouse during last week's Reddit-inspired market chaos asking for the free-trading app to put up a staggering $3 billion, co-CEO Vlad Tenev said Monday.

""This was obviously nerve-wracking,"" Tenev toldboss Elon Musk during an interview on the platform Clubhouse.

For context, Robinhood had raised only $2 billion in total venture capital funding up until that point. That's why the trading app had to draw down its credit lines last week.

And that's why Robinhood announced Monday it has raised an additional $2.4 billion from investors. That is in addition to a $1 billion capital raise announced last week. The fact that Robinhood has felt the need to raise massive sums in such a short time underscores the intense financial pressure facing the company.

Whenever investors buy stocks, brokerages like Robinhood must make a deposit first at a clearinghouse. But Tenev said the $3 billion ask was ""an order of magnitude"" larger than what Robinhood is typically required by the National Securities Clearing Corporation to put up.

The $3.4 billion capital raise came in the form of debt, specifically a convertible note, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business.

The fact that Robinhood went this route instead of selling equity is another signal of the severe financial pressure facing the startup because of Reddit-inspired market turmoil. A convertible note, a common way early-stage companies raise money, is a type of bond that can be converted to common stock.

Cash-strapped private companies sometimes choose this option because it delays the need to establish a new value for the company. Admitting that a startup's valuation has gone down can cause negative publicity. And Robinhood's valuation would have likely been pressured by the turmoil of the past week.

Growing outrage

""We had no choice in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory requirements. The team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers,"" said Tenev, who said he was asleep at the time of the early morning call from NSCC on Thursday.

But the decision later on that day to restrict trading also damaged Robinhood's brand — because the startup has long said its mission is to democratize investing. Some users threatened to quit the app, while Robinhood faced bipartisan calls for investigations in Congress.

After huddling with his senior executives, Tenev said they persuaded the clearinghouse to lower its request for capital from $3 billion to $1.4 billion.

""We were making some progress, but it's still a high number,"" Tenev said.

'People get really pissed off'

During the interview, Musk commented that it ""seems weird"" that Robinhood suddenly received such a large request from its clearinghouse.

""I wouldn't impute shadiness to it or anything like that,"" Tenev said, adding that NSCC was ""reasonable"" and ""worked with us"" to lower the deposit request. ""It was unprecedented activity.""

The Robinhood co-CEO also addressed why traders on the app could sell shares of GameStop, but not buy them.

""People get really pissed off if they are holding stock and they can't sell it,"" Tenev explained.

Of course, they also get angry if they want to buy a stock but can't.

Robinhood announced Sunday that it will further lift restrictions on stock trades — but not entirely. For instance, Robinhood users are able to buy only one share of GameStop and 10 shares of AMC.

The $3.4 billion round of funding was led by Ribbit Capital and include existing investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia.

""This funding is a strong sign of confidence from investors and will help us build for the future and continue to serve people through the exponential growth we've seen this year,"" Robinhood said in a blog post.

Denies Citadel theories

Tenev again denied speculation that its decision to cut off buys of GameStop was aimed at pleasing entities controlled by billionaire Ken Griffin.

""That's just false,"" he said.

Earlier this week, Citadel, the massive hedge fund owned by Griffin, provided a $2 billion bailout to GameStop short-seller Melvin Capital Management. Melvin Capital had bet that GameStop shares would drop — and the hedge fund was crushed when the opposite happened.

Citadel Securities, the market maker also owned by Griffin, is a major source of revenue for Robinhood. Like other brokerages, Robinhood gets paid to route orders to market makers, a controversial practice known as payment for order flow.

Last week, representatives for Citadel Securities and the Citadel hedge fund denied any role in Robinhood's decision to halt purchases of GameStop.

Musk asked Tenev if Citadel would have had a say in who was put in charge of the clearinghouse that requested the $3 billion deposit.

""I don't have any reason to believe that,"" Tenev said. ""You're getting into the conspiracy theories a little bit."""
Vaccines on hold in New York City due to storm,"Vaccines in New York City are currently on hold for the day due to the snow storm but are slated to resume on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a morning appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

In advance of the storm, New Jersey's governor, Phil Murphy, declared a state of emergency and closed all six Covid-19 vaccine mega-sites."
These 'vaccine hunters' are getting their shots ahead of schedule by gaming the system,"(CNN) If she'd waited to get vaccinated until it was her ""tier's"" turn , Isabela Medina wouldn't have gotten the Covid-19 vaccine until late summer.

She wasn't willing to wait.

Medina, a healthy 25-year-old, moved across the country to live with her parents on the East Coast after her work in the film industry dried up. Anxious to return to work safely, Medina decided in mid-January to go ""vaccine dumpster diving.""

Though a dumpster, this was not. Rather than dig through a hospital's garbage for vials, Medina staked out a grocery store pharmacy. She wanted to score a leftover vaccine.

She and a friend arrived in the early afternoon, prepared to wait. A line formed behind them. Hours later, when the day's appointments were done, pharmacy staff offered up eight leftover vaccines. Medina and her friend gleefully claimed two of them.

""I felt good about it -- and better that it didn't go to waste,"" she told CNN.

Medina is what has been described by many on the internet as a ""vaccine hunter,"" or someone who stalks a pharmacy or vaccination site for leftovers.

These vaccine seekers, spurred by reports of doses being dumped and feeling antsy for the country's vaccine rollout to pick up the pace, say they want to prevent waste -- by getting their shot early.

They see it as a win-win: They get vaccinated and a precious dose of the Covid-19 vaccine doesn't end up in the trash. But their gain is also a symptom of a lack of coordination in the US vaccination plan -- the initial rollout was much slower than expected, delaying President Joe Biden's plan for ""100 million vaccinations in 100 days.""

The lucky -- and privileged -- few who get vaccinated early assure what they're doing isn't wrong, although it certainly feels unfair to those who don't have the time or resources to ""hunt"" for their own.

Unsurprisingly, the hunters have been criticized for ""jumping the line."" But the hunters argue what they do is more ethical than letting the vaccines expire.

""This might be a good way for people who haven't been able to get around the logistical nightmare of signing up to just show up and get it,"" Medina said.

Vaccine hunting is a 'fix' for slow vaccine rollout

By all accounts, the US vaccine rollout so far has been disappointing

CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen explained, in sobering terms , just how disappointing in a January interview, before Biden was inaugurated.

The current pace is 1.3 million doses per day. At this pace, the US will have reached about 75% of population for herd immunity by summer 2021.

To vaccine hunt is to devote hours, possibly days, of your life waiting for a dose of a vaccine that may or may not be available. It's a crapshoot. You need time, money, connections and luck to succeed. But some say it's worth the effort involved.

Brad Johnson, a medical student at Tulane University, wanted to make tracking down vaccines a bit easier.

Johnson is the admin of a Facebook group called ""NOLA Vaccine Hunters,"" where New Orleans residents trade tips and share leads on leftovers.

He said he got the idea after a friend living in Israel told him about Facebook groups in the country where residents inform each other about the pharmacies that had extra doses.

""When there's a surplus of doses about to expire, they ignored the vaccination schema and just offered it to anyone,"" he told CNN.

So, about three weeks ago, Johnson made a tool like that for New Orleans. The group now has close to 600 members.

Johnson said he's heard of a few members successfully tracking down leftover vaccines for themselves or their parents.

The Facebook group is Johnson's attempt at correcting what he called a ""patchwork of chaos"" in the US vaccine distribution plan.

People without appointments wait in line for the potential chance to receive a Covid-19 vaccination that would have otherwise been discarded at the Kedren Community Health Center on January 25 in Los Angeles.

Biden has an ambitious goal of administering ""100 million vaccines in 100 days."" Whether he'll succeed has yet to be seen, considering he's been in office for less than a month. Some health officials believe his goal is too modest as Covid-19 cases continue to climb unimpeded.

The ethical conundrum of vaccine hunting

Because the vaccine is in such high demand and so difficult to actually get -- including for people who are eligible to receive their vaccine -- there's a feeling of injustice when otherwise healthy people get it, even if they aren't technically stealing doses from people who need them, said Melissa Goldstein, an associate professor at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health.

""There's this sense of unfairness, although we can't necessarily explain why,"" Goldstein, who studies bioethics, told CNN.

There's no one answer to the question of ethics of early vaccinations, except in a few situations. Take the Hollywood physician who told Variety some of his rich and famous patients attempted to bribe him for an early Covid-19 vaccine, or the Washington state hospital that invited 100 benefactors to sign up for the vaccine regardless of their place in ""line.""

However, what people in those situations did isn't comparable to what happened last week at a Seattle hospital , where a freezer malfunction meant up to 800 Covid-19 vaccines would be wasted within hours. To keep the doses from expiring, they recruited recipients on social media.

And that situation is different still than that of the ""entrepreneurial"" vaccine searchers, like Medina and Johnson, who seek out the leftover doses.

""Can we say that entrepreneurialism is an absolute wrong?"" Goldstein said. ""It's difficult, because we do have a capitalist and merit-based system. We encourage people to network, be scrappy, persistent, determined in getting what they want.""

There's privilege, too, in having the time and resources to spend hours scouring for leftover doses, Goldstein said. If only the people who can afford it are able to get vaccinated early, disparities in the rate of who's getting vaccinated will only become more severe.

Johnson said some members of the Facebook group have even crossed state lines to get vaccinated.

A few traveled to rural towns in Mississippi, where health departments have had trouble disseminating all of their allotted doses because residents are hesitant to take the vaccine , he said.

It's not an ideal solution, he said. But when ""motivated people"" are willing to get vaccinated, even if it's not at the time they were designated by their state, Johnson said he thinks they should do it.

""I am all for getting vaccines into arms and not letting them sit,"" he said.

How to make early vaccination equitable

Medina's vaccine quest played out over three days. She asked CNN not to disclose her location or the pharmacy where she received the vaccine so as not to bombard them with would-be ""vaccine hunters.""

There were others like her, spending the better part of the afternoon waiting.

In a TikTok from that day that has since been viewed more than 1.4 million times, she is seen dancing with a clipboard and joyfully calling someone holding her vaccination card, quoting Kamala Harris -- ""We did it, Joe!""

Her second dose is scheduled for late February.

Medina doesn't have qualms about her decision -- she's working freelance gigs rather than a full-time job, so she was able to spend the time it took to get her shot.

""I'm really in a privileged position like, socioeconomically, in that I can wait all day for this vaccine,"" she said. ""Those vaccination centers need to do better job and figure out a way to vaccinate the communities they're meant to be vaccinating.""

There are some methods, Goldstein said, that could make early vaccinations slightly more equitable.

Grocery store pharmacies could offer leftover vaccine doses to grocery store workers, nearly 40% of whom are Black, Latino or Asian, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Black and Latino Americans, specifically, are being vaccinated at a lower rate than White Americans . And as essential workers who come face-to-face with customers, they need to protect themselves to continue their work.

And Biden has already unveiled a detailed Covid-19 strategy to replace the slipshod response under the Trump administration. His plan includes creating vaccination sites in low-income communities.

Johnson's doing his part, too. After weeks of trying to reach the Louisiana Department of Health, he said he finally got through to them. Now, he said, he's working with state health officials to better coordinate who receives leftover vaccines in the state.

He's hoping they can create an official vaccine waiting list that prioritizes health care workers, seniors and essential workers.

For now, though, he supports whoever wants to get a vaccine -- as long as they don't actually jump the line.

Trump loses his impeachment team amid unfaltering loyalty from the GOP,"(CNN) Former President Donald Trump's lies and his insistence that the November election was rigged against him may have turned out to be a bridge too far for the attorneys who were slated to defend him in his upcoming Senate impeachment trial in a little more than a week.

But his party has largely stuck with him . After a brief flirtation with reason and sound judgment in the weeks following the January 6 siege at the Capitol, the Republican Party has decided to honor their deep and often blind allegiance to Trump, choosing to overlook his role in inciting the deadly insurrection rather than pay the price of crossing him and his base next year at the ballot box.

The collapse of Trump's legal team amid a disagreement over legal strategy, which CNN first reported Saturday night, stood in stark contrast to the slow crawl of Republican elected leaders back into the former President's corner as the anger lawmakers feel about the insurrection fades and his potential power to help or destroy them in the 2022 elections becomes paramount.

While the Republican Party continues to bend to Trump's whims, forgive his dangerous behavior, and quiver in the face of his election threats, the judiciary and the legal profession are adhering to a higher ethical standard -- and have largely refused to tolerate his efforts to ramrod the nation's democratic institutions and founding principles throughout his baseless election charade -- making the GOP's loyalty to Trump even more appalling.

A person familiar with the departures of the five attorneys -- Butch Bowers, Deborah Barbier, Josh Howard, Johnny Gasser and Greg Harris — told CNN that Trump wanted the attorneys to center his defense on the notion that there was mass election fraud in November and that the election was stolen from him, instead of questioning the legality of convicting a president after he's left office . Trump was not receptive to the discussions about how they should proceed, according to CNN's Gloria Borger, Kaitlan Collins, Jeff Zeleny and Ashley Semler.

Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who recently voted with the majority of his party to table a discussion about the constitutionality of impeaching Trump -- which was viewed as a test vote indicating that the former President would be acquitted after the trial because of his substantial support within the GOP ranks -- said Sunday that he believes the question of whether a president can be convicted after leaving office needs to be answered, but that the country needs to move on from Trump's allegations of election fraud.

There were not ""adequate irregularities or fraud, not widespread enough to change the result of the election, period,"" Portman told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" ""We have to acknowledge that this election was lost and we have to move on.""

And yet, most of the GOP has shown their uneasiness about forcing repercussions for the former President. They demonstrated how much the party has been irrevocably changed by Trump's corrosive influence last week when Republican members stood by mostly silently and refused to reprimand Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who should have ended the week in disgrace after CNN's KFile exposed that she previously indicated support for executing prominent Democrats.

Instead, like Trump, the freshman Republican has doubled down and escaped largely unscathed, avoiding any punishment from GOP leaders as she falsely claims to be the victim of a ""blood thirsty media."" On Saturday, she emerged defiant on Twitter after claiming to have had a ""great call"" with Trump , continuing to spout falsehoods about the presidential election and failing to show a shred of remorse for her endorsement of violent threats against lawmakers or offensive and baseless theories about the Parkland shooting . While her conduct gets a pass from GOP leaders, some Republican state parties and local leaders are rushing to condemn the GOP lawmakers who dared to vote for the impeachment of the former President.

The case of both Trump -- who is expected to be acquitted in the Senate -- and Greene is the latest example of how the party of Lincoln has become the party of no consequences, untethered from its moorings by Trump's embrace of baseless conspiracy theories and his coddling of the most dangerous fringe elements of the party.

In phrases that could have been ripped from Trump's own permanently suspended Twitter account , Greene asserted Saturday that she'll ""never apologize"" or ""back down"" despite CNN's revelations about her shocking, conspiracy-laden social media feeds, including the fact that she liked a comment suggesting that ""a bullet to the head would be quicker"" as a way to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She also expressed support for comments about executing FBI agents.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who should be the person responsible for enforcing discipline within his ranks and setting the guardrails of decorum, indicated that he intends to talk to Greene this week about the posts threatening to kill lawmakers. But he too spent last week trying to cozy up to Trump at Mar-a-Lago and make amends for his fleeting reprimand of the former President after the insurrection that endangered the lives of his members, paying homage to the standard bearer in a party that's already gearing up for a divisive primary cycle.

At least 50 House Democrats have called for Greene to be removed from the House, with others calling for censure or stripping her of her committee assignments, but there is no indication yet that she will be upbraided by GOP leadership.

Before she was elected to the solidly red district last fall, Republican strategists expressed concern about Greene's ties to Islamophobic and anti-Semitic tropes, and her past support for QAnon -- whose followers believe the baseless conspiracy theory that Trump was engaged in a battle against celebrities and Democrats who abuse children. But she won and has been among Trump's strongest supporters , backing his false claims that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. She has worn a mask to the Capitol that reads ""Trump won.""

""I had a GREAT call with my all-time favorite POTUS, President Trump!"" Greene tweeted Saturday. ""I'm so grateful for his support and more importantly the people of this country are absolutely 100% loyal to him because he is 100% loyal to the people and America First."" Trump's office has not responded to requests for comment about the call.

Republicans feeling the heat for impeachment vote

Meanwhile, it is the Republicans who defied Trump with their votes on impeachment earlier this month who now appear to be in the most political peril . On Saturday, the South Carolina Republican Party voted to formally censure Rep. Tom Rice for voting to impeach Trump, with South Carolina GOP Chairman Drew McKissick claiming that the vote amounted to ""nothing more than a political kick on the way out the door,"" and one that ""played right into the Democrats' game.""

A number of the other nine House Republicans who joined Rice in that impeachment vote -- as well as state officials who certified the election results showing President Joe Biden won -- are facing a backlash at home, with the Trump-aligned flank of their party promising primary challenges, rebukes from local leaders and an onslaught of spending against them.

Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey was recently censured by his state's GOP, along with Cindy McCain and former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, because rank-and-file Republican members in Arizona viewed them as insufficiently loyal to Trump. But Ducey, who certified the results showing Biden's win, called the censure an action ""of very little consequence.""

On Sunday, he told Bash that the censure reflected a ""long history of discontent"" in his party in Arizona. Once the vote was audited and determined accurate, ""I had very little choice but to do the right thing, follow the law and the Constitution.""

Several GOP lawmakers have called for stripping Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking House Republican, of her leadership position after she supported impeachment. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, a close Trump ally, trolled her with a rally in her home state on Thursday and Trump has been weighing how he should exact his revenge, reportedly showing allies polling to make the case that she has been weakened at home.

In Cheyenne, Gaetz sought to inflame the divisions within his party as he championed ""prairie populism"" and called on Republicans to defeat Cheney when she runs for reelection, going so far as to take a phone call from Donald Trump Jr. to amplify that message. He claimed that Cheney was part of a ""private insider club"" that includes Biden, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Pelosi that wants to use government to ""enrich themselves.""

""Washington, DC, mythologizes the establishment power brokers like Liz Cheney for climbing in a deeply corrupt game. But there are more of us than there are of them and we see the fakes and the phonies more clearly than ever before,"" Gaetz said during the rally. ""If you want to prove you have the power, defeat Liz Cheney in this upcoming election and Wyoming will bring Washington to its knees.""

Cheney told her party that her vote on the impeachment article -- accusing Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"" -- was a vote of conscience. McCarthy has said he supports Cheney but has ""concerns."" The votes for impeachment by Cheney and the nine other Republicans could come up at a meeting with all House Republicans on Wednesday, but it is unclear whether or how McCarthy intends to address the controversy over Greene's social media posts. So far, he's only publicly weighed in through a spokesman who called Greene's comments ""deeply disturbing."" The minority leader already canceled a GOP leadership meeting scheduled for Tuesday -- because he will be traveling back from Houston from an energy event, his spokesman told CNN. However, he offered no additional details for why it wasn't rescheduled, and a source familiar believes one of the reasons McCarthy canceled is because he doesn't want to discuss Greene.

'Lies of a feather flock together'

In her Twitter thread Saturday, Greene tried to claim that, like Trump, that she is a victim of ""blood thirsty media"" and ""the socialists hate America"" Democrats. Alluding to Pelosi's comments during a news conference this week that ""the enemy is within the House of Representatives,"" Greene sought to define the enemy as ""a poisonous rot of socialist policies"" and ""America last sell outs who are pompous hypocrites that believe they are untouchable elites.""

She was rebuked by Romney -- a rare Republican who's frequently spoken out against Trump -- on Twitter Saturday: ""Lies of a feather flock together: Marjorie Taylor Greene's nonsense and the 'big lie' of a stolen election.""

Portman said on ""State of the Union"" Sunday that Republicans ought to ""stand up and say it is totally unacceptable what she has said.""

""There is no place for violence in our political dialogue,"" said the Ohio senator, who announced early last week that he will not seek reelection after his current term in office ends in 2022.

But as most Republicans remain silent about Greene, tensions continue to rise between her and some of the Democrats who want to see formal action to reprimand her for her past comments. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, plans to move to an office farther away from Greene's after the two had an argument over mask wearing earlier this month.

Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, said on Saturday that ""the Republican leadership has to step up at this point"" because Greene ""is an embarrassment to us all.""

Thompson called on McCarthy to take a stand for the good of his party, calling it a sad day for Republican politics in America: ""He has the number one position in the Republican party in the House of Representatives,"" Thompson said of McCarthy during an interview with CNN's Ana Cabrera on ""Newsroom"" Saturday.

""He has to demonstrate that leadership. Otherwise, he's complicit in what she's doing with his silence.""

But McCarthy's visit to Mar-a-Lago this week suggested his top concern is staying in Trump's good graces, which means Greene -- and those who share her beliefs -- likely won't be going anywhere.

Comparing the Biden and GOP stimulus plans,"(CNN) President Joe Biden and a group of 10 Republican senators have very different ideas for the next coronavirus relief bill.

The President last month outlined a $1.9 trillion package that included a wide range of immediate assistance for struggling families, such as $1,400 stimulus checks and extended unemployment, nutrition and eviction aid, and longer-term changes, such as a $15 hourly minimum wage.

But the measure immediately ran into resistance from Republicans on Capitol Hill. In response, a group of 10 senators on Sunday released their own roughly $618 billion relief proposal -- less than one-third the size of the President's. They provided a chart detailing the cost of their plan on Monday morning.

The senators met with Biden on Monday to discuss their plan. Afterward, both sides described the meeting as cordial but said there was no agreement on a bipartisan deal.

Meanwhile, Democratic Senate leaders are preparing to trigger a controversial budget procedure known as reconciliation that would allow them to pass Biden's rescue package without Republican support.

Here's what we know so far about the differences between the two packages.

Stimulus payments

Both parties have traded proposals on stimulus checks. Democrats favor giving eligible Americans a top-up to $2,000, while Republicans are offering slightly less and want to lower the income range of those who would qualify.

Biden's plan would cost $465 billion, according to the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, while the Republicans say their measure would cost an estimated $220 billion.

Biden: The President's plan calls for The President's plan calls for sending another $1,400 per person to eligible recipients. This money would be in addition to the $600 payments that were approved by Congress in December -- for a total of $2,000.

Individuals earning less than $75,000 a year will receive the full $600. Married couples filing jointly earning less than $150,000 are also due the full amount of $1,200.

The payments will phase out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.

The new payments would go to adult dependents that were left out of the earlier rounds, like some children over the age of 17. It would also include households with mixed immigration status, after the first round of $1,200 checks left out the spouses of undocumented immigrants who do not have Social Security numbers.

GOP: The Republican senators want to send $1,000 checks, per adult, but target them to those with lower incomes. The amount would begin phasing out at $40,000 for individuals and $80,000 for couples filing jointly. The upper cap would be $50,000 for individuals and $100,000 for couples. Dependent adults and children would receive $500.

Unemployment benefits

This is another big point of difference. The President is proposing extending benefits through September, while Republicans -- who have consistently expressed concerns that making unemployment benefits too generous will dissuade people from getting back into the job market -- are suggesting extending support only through June. Biden's plan would cost $350 billion, according to the committee, while the senators say their proposal would cost $132 billion.

Biden: The President would increase the federal boost the jobless receive to $400 a week, from The President would increase the federal boost the jobless receive to $400 a week, from the $300 weekly enhancement contained in Congress' relief package from December.

He would also extend the payments, along with two key pandemic unemployment programs, through September. This applies to those in the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program who have exhausted their regular state jobless payments and in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides benefits to the self-employed, independent contractors, gig workers and certain people affected by the pandemic.

Lawmakers only provided an additional 11 weeks of support in the December package, which will last until March.

GOP: The GOP proposal would extend the $300 weekly benefit through June 30. It would also provide $2 billion to states to improve their technology.

Coronavirus vaccines, testing and tracing

Both plans would provide $160 billion to fight the virus.

Biden: The President's plan calls for investing $20 billion in a The President's plan calls for investing $20 billion in a national vaccination program , including launching community vaccination centers around the country and mobile units in hard-to-reach areas. Biden would also increase federal support to vaccinate Medicaid enrollees.

The proposal would also invest $50 billion in testing, providing funds to purchase rapid tests, expand lab capacity and help schools implement regular testing to support reopening.

It would also fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers, nearly tripling the community health workforce. It would address health disparities by expanding community health centers and health services on tribal lands. And it would provide support to long-term care facilities experiencing outbreaks and to prisons for mitigation strategies.

GOP: The Republicans' proposal calls for providing the same amount to battle the pandemic. It would fund a National Vaccine Program, expansion of testing, a disaster relief fund and personal protective equipment for first responders, independent physician offices and dentists.

It would also provide $15 billion to replenish the National Strategic Stockpile and inject $35 billion to the provider relief fund, which reimburses hospitals and health care providers for coronavirus-related expenses and revenue losses.

Nutrition assistance

The two plans are similar when it comes to extending food stamp benefits. Biden's package does not put a price tag on this provision, but the Republicans say their plan would cost $12 billion.

Biden: The President would extend the 15% increase in food stamp benefits through September, instead of having it expire in June. He would invest another $3 billion to help women, infants and children secure food, and give US territories $1 billion in nutrition assistance. And he would partner with restaurants to provide food to needy Americans and jobs to laid-off restaurant workers.

GOP: The senators would also extend enhanced food stamp benefits through September as well as provide $3 billion for WIC funding.

Small businesses

Both plans would funnel about $50 billion into small business assistance but through different programs.

Biden: The President's plan calls for providing $15 billion to create a new grant program for The President's plan calls for providing $15 billion to create a new grant program for small business owners , separate from the existing Paycheck Protection Program

It also proposes making a $35 billion investment in some state, local, tribal and non-profit financing programs that make low-interest loans and provide venture capital to entrepreneurs.

GOP: The senators would funnel more money into Paycheck Protection Program and the Emergency Injury Disaster program, which provides long-term, low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration. Their proposal includes $5 million for audits and investigations into the Paycheck Protection Program.

School reopening

Biden, who has made reopening in-person programs a top priority, is offering far more money to pay for upgrades that teachers and districts say are needed to return safely.

Biden: The President would provide a total of $170 billion more to K-12 schools, colleges and universities to help them reopen and operate safely or to facilitate remote learning.

It would provide $130 billion for schools to reopen and for districts to meet students' academic, social, emotional and mental health needs. Another $35 billion would go to public colleges, including community colleges, and public and private historically black and minority-serving institutions. And it would provide governors with $5 billion to support the hardest hit educational programs, from early childhood to K-12 to higher education.

Congress approved $82 billion in aid for schools in December.

GOP: The Republicans would provide $20 billion for getting K-12 students back to school.

Child care

Both plans call for spending billions on child care.

Biden: The President's plan calls on Congress to create a $25 billion emergency fund to help child care providers in danger of closing and to assist those have shut their doors to reopen. It will help pay for rent, utilities and payroll, as well as coronavirus protection measures.

Biden's package would also add $15 billion to the existing child care and development block grant program, which provides federal assistance to help low-income families who are working or taking classes pay for child care. The provision aims to help parents struggling to pay for care and to assist women in returning to the workforce , who have left in disproportionate numbers to take care of their children.

It also proposes expanding the child care tax credit for one year so that families will get back as much as half of their spending on child care for children under age 13.

GOP: The senators would allocate $20 billion to the child care and development block grant program.

Mental health services

Both plans would increase funding for mental health services by the same amount.

Biden: The President's package calls for sending $4 billion to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration to expand access to treatment.

GOP: The senators would also increase funding for behavioral health services by $4 billion.

What else is in the Biden plan

Republicans have not yet released the full details of their plan, but here's what else was in Biden's proposal.

Rental assistance and eviction moratorium

The President would provide $25 billion in rental assistance for low- and moderate-income households who have lost jobs during the pandemic. That's in addition to the $25 billion lawmakers provided in December.

Another $5 billion would be set aside to help struggling renters pay their utility bills. Biden is also calling for $5 billion to help states and localities assist those at risk of experiencing homelessness.

The plan would extend the federal eviction moratorium, which was to expire at the end of January, to September 30, as well as allow people with federally-guaranteed mortgages to apply for forbearance until September 30.

Aid for states

Biden wants to send $350 billion to state, local and territorial governments to keep their frontline workers employed, distribute the vaccine, increase testing, reopen schools and maintain vital services.

Asked during a call with reporters whether states could use the funds to offset declines in tax revenue spurred by the pandemic, a senior Biden administration official did not clarify. The aid is intended to be flexible, an official told CNN later.

Additional assistance to states has been among the most controversial elements of the congressional rescue packages, with Democrats looking to add to the $150 billion in the March legislation and Republicans resisting such efforts. The December package ultimately dropped an initial call to include $160 billion.

Biden's plan would also give $20 billion to the hardest-hit public transit agencies to help avert layoffs and the cutting of routes.

A temporary increase in tax credits

Biden wants to boost the child tax credit to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for those between ages 6 and 17 for a year. The credit would also be made fully refundable. This would cost $120 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

And he proposes to raise the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit for a year to close to $1,500 for childless adults, increase the income limit for the credit to about $21,000 and expand the age range of eligibility to cover older workers.

Both of these are aimed at supporting low-income families, including millions of essential workers.

Health insurance premium subsidies

Biden is also calling on Congress to subsidize through September the premiums of those who lost their work-based health insurance.

He wants to increase and expand the Affordable Care Act's premium subsidies so that enrollees don't have to pay more than 8.5% of their income for coverage -- which is also one of his campaign promises. (The law is facing a challenge from Republican-led states that is currently before the Supreme Court.)

Also, he wants Congress to provide $20 billion to meet the health care needs of veterans.

Emergency paid leave

The President's plan would reinstate the paid sick and family leave benefits that expired at the end of December until September 30.

It would extend the benefit to workers employed at businesses with more than 500 employees and less than 50, as well as federal workers who were excluded from the original program.

Under Biden's proposal, people who are sick or quarantining, or caring for a child whose school is closed, will receive 14 weeks of paid leave. The government will reimburse employers with fewer than 500 workers for the full cost of providing the leave.

A $15 hourly minimum wage

Biden is calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and to end the tipped minimum wage and the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities.

"They care for Florida's elderly, but home health care workers are struggling to get Covid-19 vaccines","Palm Beach County, FL (CNN) Evelyn Aub is a spunky senior who doesn't reveal her age to anyone. But she admits that she qualifies to receive the Covid-19 vaccine in Florida, which means she's at least 65 years young.

""I'm completely independent,"" Aub said. ""Happy as a lark.""

Aub says her home in Palm Beach County, Florida, is her safe haven. Her car is her freedom and the Covid-19 vaccine is hope. And while getting an appointment for the vaccine online seemed ""impossible,"" her son, using multiple devices, managed to secure her an appointment for the vaccine at a Publix supermarket near her home.

It's an appointment she attended alone, driving her sedan with license plates that bear her name and call for protecting Florida's reefs.

""Not nervous at all,"" Aub said.

Aub is one of more than 1.2 million seniors 65 or over who have received one or both doses of the vaccine in Florida. And while the rollout of the shot has been bumpy, Gov. Ron DeSantis has been working to fulfill his promise to first protect seniors from the coronavirus.

So far, state data shows about 71% of people inoculated in the state are seniors.

Florida's vaccine blind spot

But DeSantis' promise has a blind spot, say some home health workers who take care of vulnerable seniors inside their homes. Home health workers have been fighting a losing battling with seniors and the state for the same vaccine slots on the same jammed websites and clogged phone lines.

""It's terrible. It's awful,"" Stephaney Hyman-McDonald, a home health worker, told CNN. ""It puts you in a tough position because you are younger, yes, but you work with someone who needs to be protected.""

Hyman-McDonald takes care of a senior battling cancer and says she had to compete with seniors in her community, including her mom, for a vaccine appointment. While she was lucky enough to score a slot for the first dose on Friday, the accomplishment generated conflicting feelings because she didn't want to take a vaccine that could have gone to a senior.

Stephaney Hyman-McDonald is a home health worker in Palm Beach County.

""We hear about this issue every day and from all over Florida,"" said Kyle Simon, director of governmental affairs and communications at Home Care Association of Florida , an industry trade group.

Simon says that, while on paper health care workers, which include home health care workers, are a priority group, in practice interpretations of the governor's executive order on the Covid-19 vaccine, which was issued on December 23, have varied county by county and resulted in home health workers being turned away at vaccination sites.

The governor's order prioritizes three groups, including long-term care facility residents and staff, persons 65 and older and health care personnel with direct patient contact. In fact, 97,500 doses of the first round of vaccines received by the state in December were sent to hospitals to be administered to health care workers.

""What some public health officials and medical experts seem to be forgetting is that, while it's critical that patients 65 and up get the vaccine as soon as possible... giving home care workers access to the vaccines gives these vulnerable patients a layer of protection so that clinicians and caregivers are not coming into their homes and potentially infecting them,"" Simon said.

Florida has about 80,000 home health workers, according to Simon, and only a ""small fraction"" of them have been vaccinated more than a month after DeSantis gave health care workers priority access to the vaccine.

Two vaccine problems: supply and distribution

DeSantis maintains that getting more people vaccinated requires getting more vaccines. And he's been fighting the White House over the issue. During a briefing last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Florida had only administered half the vaccines it had received.

DeSantis fired back during a news conference. He claimed the doses on hand in his state were second doses. The current Covid-19 vaccines available to the public require two doses.

Palm Beach County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay says that her constituents were battling a vaccine supply problem. But they were also facing a distribution problem.

During a Palm Beach County Commissioner's meeting last week, Dr. Alina Alonso, director of the Florida Department of Health for the county, announced that Publix would be the only supplier of the vaccine to the public.

And while DeSantis said last week that ""90%"" of seniors in Palm Beach County lived within a mile-and-a-half of a Publix, McKinlay told CNN the remaining 10% don't have that convenience and they all live in her district, a rural area.

""I'm absolutely disgusted that the governor of this state has 100% taken the ability to vaccinate the residents of Palm Beach County out of the public health officials and our medical officials and given that authority to a corporate entity,"" McKinlay said during the commissioners' meeting.

In other counties, like Miami-Dade and Broward, vaccines are distributed through hospitals and state-run sites.

Three days after McKinlay's public comments, she took to Twitter to share that she had spoken to Florida's director of the Division of Emergency Management, Jared Moskowitz, and a portion of the vaccines designated for Palm Beach County would be diverted to rural areas of the county.

""Thank you,"" McKinlay tweeted . ""It's a small step forward towards a much bigger challenge. But, I'll take a small step in the right direction.""

State-wide vaccine registration system

On Friday, the Florida Department of Health launched a statewide preregistration system to schedule Covid-19 vaccine appointments for seniors and frontline health care workers.

Preregistration can be made through the state's designated website or by phone through a county by county toll free number.

Simon says he hopes the new centralized system will streamline the process for home care workers, seniors and other priority populations.

""The county by county piecemeal approach clearly has not worked,"" Simon said.

After taking the first dose of the vaccine, Evelyn Aub walked out of Publix, hopped in her car and drove home.

""It didn't hurt,"" Aub said. ""No problem whatsoever.""

Aub says she will continue to wear a mask and social distance because she knows the vaccine, even after the second dose, is not foolproof.

As for why she keeps her age a secret, even from her closest friends, Aub said that when people learn how old she is they worry and say ""be careful,"" and ""don't do this"" and ""don't do that.""

Aub insists she not be treated like a fragile senior, ""If they don't know how old I am, they treat me like themselves."""

"If you received unemployment last year, you could be in for a surprise at tax time","Tens of millions of Americans collected unemployment benefits for at least some period of time last year due to the pandemic's hit on the economy.

After the stress of losing their job and figuring out how much their unemployment check would cover, chances are good taxes weren't top of mind for too many people.

Nevertheless, unemployment compensation is treated as taxable income both by the IRS and by most states. (The exceptions are Alabama, Alaska, California, Florida, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.)

Massive winter storm slams the Northeast and could bury NYC in 2 feet of snow,"(CNN) The first major winter storm of 2021 blasted New York City and other parts of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Monday, snarling transportation, shutting down coronavirus vaccination sites and threatening the biggest storm surge since Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

New Yorkers are being urged to stay home unless they are essential workers.

""I want New Yorkers to hear me loud and clear -- stay home and off the roads,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in declaring a state of emergency for 44 counties.

The forecast for impacts of the nor'easter through Tuesday

Many areas got more than 12 inches of snow. Portions of northern New Jersey have received over two feet of snow. The highest total was 30 inches in Mendham, New Jersey, according to a tweet from the National Weather Service Eastern Region.

In addition to New Jersey, over a foot of snow has been observed at reporting stations in Connecticut, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania.

Central Park reported 15.3 inches of snow, the National Weather Service said. Five other weather service climate stations in the New York area -- JFK, LaGuardia, Islip, Newark and Bridgeport airports -- each had record totals of snow as of 4 p.m.

CNN meteorologists say it's possible around 2 feet of snow will blanket the city before the storm passes.

About 19 inches had fallen in one neighborhood in the borough of the Bronx.

""The storm is still developing. It's still intensifying. It's a massive storm,"" CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said. The storm may not let up until Wednesday morning.

""Make no mistake: this storm will bring heavy snowfall, and it will make travel dangerous in every neighborhood in our city,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ""New Yorkers should stay home, keep the roads clear for emergency vehicles, and let our plows work to keep us all safe.""

Covid-19 vaccination sites in the state were closed Monday because of the storm. Mass vaccination sites at SUNY Stony Brook, Jones Beach, Aqueduct Racetrack, the Javits Center and the Westchester County Center will all be closed Tuesday, officials said.

De Blasio said appointments can be rescheduled, and NYC will be able to catch up ""quickly.""

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency , closing all state offices and the New Jersey Transit system. Offices and six large coronavirus vaccine sites will be closed Tuesday.

""This is a big one and it's going to be with us at this point, we think, until tomorrow night,"" Murphy said during a Monday news conference . ""The worst is yet to come.""

A worker clears snow off the sidewalks in Times Square, New York City, on Monday.

More than 1,300 flights across the United States were preemptively canceled ahead of the nor'easter and, by Monday night, the number of canceled flights within, into or out of the country had risen to almost 1,700, according to Flightaware.com . More than 500 flights scheduled for Tuesday have been canceled, according to the website, which does not attribute reasons for cancellations.

LaGuardia Airport and JFK canceled all remaining commercial flights for Monday.

Amtrak on Monday afternoon suspended service between New York City and Boston and New York City and Albany. Amtrak will run a modified schedule Tuesday, the service said.

Storm surge may top seawall

The strong onshore winds from the powerful nor'easter may bring the highest water levels into New York City since Superstorm Sandy flooded city streets and subway lines in 2012.

Arturo Diaz, 4, plays in a deep snow bank in Hoboken, New Jersey, on Monday.

Storm surge from the system pushed water levels 2 to 3 feet above normal Monday morning.

""The city should see the highest water levels tonight in the runup to high tide,"" which occurs around midnight local time, said Bill Goodman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Upton, New York.

The forecast calls for water levels to reach 8.4 feet late Monday, very near the 8.5-foot level where water washes over the Battery Park seawall in New York and begins to flood the boardwalk, according to NOAA data.

""I'd give it a one in three chance to overtop the seawall,"" Goodman told CNN. ""It is certainly something we will be watching for tonight.""

The hard-hit places

New York City

The snowfall, which began late Sunday night, picked up intensity Monday.

The city transit authority suspended outdoor subway service starting at 2 p.m. Monday.

Buses were still operating, but the city and state are monitoring the situation closely, said Sarah Feinberg, interim president of the New York City Transit Authority.

No empty or tandem tractor trailers are allowed on bridges, and pedestrian walkways on some bridges were closed.

Steve Kent skis through Times Square in New York on Monday.

Students in the city school system will take classes remotely through Tuesday, de Blasio said.

Strong winds made life difficult for pedestrians at Columbus Circle. One person even had to grab onto a pillar for balance, CNN affiliate WCBS reported, and others struggled to keep their feet.

""It's a little challenging,"" East New York resident Debra Paul said. ""The gentleman had to hold me, because I was lifting off the ground.""

The storm could drop up to 21 inches by the time it ends. If that happens, it will be the most snow the city has seen since the January 22-24, 2016, storm that dumped 27.5 inches over a two-day period. It would also cement this storm as one of the most prolific winter storms for the city, placing it in the top 10 of largest snowfall totals on record.

Washington, DC

Janine Iselmann and her son Max, build a snowman in Washington, DC, on Monday.

Washington saw 2-3 inches of snow, ending a run of 710 consecutive days without an inch of snow or more, the second-longest in the city going back to 1884.

On Monday, the precipitation transitioned to a sleet and snow mix, coating roadways with ice and adding to driving danger.

There's a chance of some light snow on Tuesday morning before it ends in the afternoon.

Philadelphia

A similar combination of rain and snow hit Philadelphia, where 6 inches of snow fell at the airport. A rain-snow mix in the morning will likely switch back to snow through Tuesday. The final total expected there is around a foot.

Philadelphians made the most of the snow. Larry Levine took his daughter Abigail sledding despite a lack of hills in Rittenhouse Square, CNN affiliate WGBS reported . ""Abigail was wondering if there's enough snow for playing and I said, 'Let's give it a try!"" Levine said, as he pulled her sled through the park.

Boston

A winter weather advisory was in effect and the city issued a snow emergency

Snow totals forecast through Tuesday

Boston is accustomed to significant snowfall, having alerted crews to plow 2,000 lane miles of the city's roadways through Tuesday.

More than 67 million people across a dozen states from Tennessee to Maine are under some kind of winter watch or warning.

Lots of people moved out of New York and California in 2020. Here's where they went,"When Mark Jenkins and Lori Crowell rang in 2020, they had no idea they'd be moving to another state before the end of the year. But then the pandemic hit and so much changed.

""We thought about leaving Seattle the past couple years, but we weren't ready,"" said Jenkins. But when the pandemic made remote work more of a reality for him and they realized they could live anywhere, they packed up and moved to Idaho. ""The weather is a big improvement. The traffic is better. It is very welcoming. People are strangely friendly.""

Millions of Americans ended 2020 living at a different address than where they started the year.

By October, 8.93 millionpeople had moved since the pandemic began in March, according to an analysis of United States Postal Service change of address requests by the National Association of Realtors. That's an increase of nearly 94,000 from the same period the year before.

Where were all these people moving to -- and from?

""New York and California had much higher outbound activity,"" said Barry Schellenberg, Atlas Van Lines president. ""It could be the cost of living, tax rates or the political climate, perhaps.""

This pattern is expected to continue into 2021, according to NAR. With more people deciding where they live based on their own personal needs instead of their commuting time to work, it could mean long-term growth for suburbs and smaller cities.

""People want to migrate where they want to go and a lot more companies are allowing employees to work remotely,"" said Schellenberg. ""Very large organizations have broadcast to their employees: You don't need to be close to the office anymore.""

A 'land rush' in Idaho

Idaho topped Atlas' list for states with the most inbound moves, meaning more moving trucks were arriving in the state than leaving it. Also in the top 10 were North Carolina, Maine, Alabama and New Mexico.

""The Boise land rush, I call it,"" said Jenkins, a consultant aerospace engineer who relocated to Idaho In November. ""I've never seen so much construction. Not just houses. Schools. Roads. Hospitals. Churches. It is exciting.""

The pandemic had accelerated Jenkins' shift to remote work, allowing for a quality of life move that they had been considering. The Seattle protests last summer against police brutality and systemic racism, which turned into violent clashes with the police , pushed them further.

""It was a tipping point,"" he said. They inked a deal on a new construction home in June and moved into a rental in Idaho in November. They expect to move into their new home this April.

Barbara Dopp, an agent with Keller Williams Realty Boise, said that her team had their best year ever in 2020 and half their sales were to buyers coming from out of state.

""I had people calling me, primarily from California and Washington, and they would say, 'I just have to get out,'"" Dopp said. ""We are a conservative state and people are attracted to that.""

Rick and Julie Halstead bought this home outside of Boise that was newer, bigger and cheaper than the home they sold in the suburbs of Seattle.

She said buyers coming to Idaho were looking to get away from changes in taxes, local ordinances or the curriculum taught in schools -- and they were seeking more safety, she said.

""Their perception was that it wasn't safe to walk their streets, that things had changed and they weren't going back,"" she said.

Rick Halstead, who also works in the aviation industry in Seattle, and his wife Julie also left Seattle for Idaho as a result of the pandemic, protests and what he described as a steady decline in their quality of life.

""The pendulum of the political environment really swung in the past 10 years,"" Halstead said. ""There were more and more protests, which would snarl traffic. Opioid problems. Homelessness. Crime. It was encroaching where we lived.""

Rick and Julie Halstead moved to Boise last year after the pandemic enabled them to work remotely and they saw their quality of life diminish in the suburbs of Seattle.

Over a couple weeks in June, a curfew was placed on their neighborhood for safety reasons, police helicopters circled overhead and then, Halstead said, there was a shooting.

""It didn't feel like home anymore,"" he said. ""Arriving in Idaho has felt like going back 15 years. You get the sense in our neighborhood you'd be okay leaving the doors unlocked. We've met more neighbors in three months than we met in our old neighborhood in seven years.""

The couple now work remotely permanently and sold their 20-year-old home in Lynnwood, a Seattle suburb, for $630,000. They bought a new construction home that is 600 square feet bigger for $429,000 in Meridian, Idaho.

""It's bigger, brand new and the house payment is $1,000 less [a month],"" said Halstead.

Most surprising, he said, his health is improving.

""I just had a physical and my blood pressure was a lot lower,"" he said. ""I haven't done anything different but move here and it went down by 20 points. I feel a lot less anxious. I kind of felt like I was always looking over my shoulder.""

The Southeast is another draw

Tennessee was another top destination among people looking to relocate last year, according to a report from U-Haul, which tracks the net gain of one-way U-Haul trucks entering a state versus leaving over the course of a year. Texas and Florida, which had a lock on the top two spots since 2015, came in second and third, respectively, last year.

""I'm seeing a lot of people from California move to Tennessee because they're attracted to our lifestyle,"" said Jeff Porter, U-Haul Company of Nashville president. ""Tennessee has no income tax and is very business friendly. There are plenty of jobs. People and companies are taking note.""

The one-and-a-half bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where Edward Hill and his wife lived before moving to Nashville.

Edward Hill and his wife, Margaret, moved out of their one-and-a-half-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood and bought a home in Nashville in May. The couple had become concerned about the impact of the pandemic on their health and mobility in the city at the beginning of March. With both of them shifting to remote work full-time, they left on March 11 and initially went to his family's home outside of Charlottesville, Virginia.

They had considered a move to either Virginia or Tennessee to be near family. By May, they had decided to make a permanent move to Nashville to be closer to Margaret's family and to support her work in the music industry.

""Normally we wouldn't have moved last year,"" Hill said. ""We would have renewed our lease, but the pandemic just gave us the boost to get out of there.""

The 2,200 square foot home outside of Nashville where Edward and Margaret Hill moved during the pandemic.

Because of the pandemic they haven't gone out much since buying their new home. But they have a lot more room to live, a yard for their dog and there is good fishing -- Hill's passion -- nearby. Plus, it's a lot cheaper than Brooklyn.

""The mortgage is half of what rent was in Brooklyn,"" Hill said. ""Definitely a lower cost of living here.""

Leaving big cities for the suburbs

While large cities lost the most people during the first seven months of the pandemic, many residents that left didn't go far, according to NAR's analysis.

Between March and October of 2020, most Manhattanites moved to Brooklyn (33%), the Hamptons (29%) and Jersey City (8%), according to NAR. Similarly, most San Franciscans moved to a county within 60 miles of their previous home.

Suburban counties topped the list of places gaining the most people, while cities saw the biggest losses.

Williamson County in Texas, a suburban area outside of Austin, saw the biggest migration gains in the country during the first seven months of the pandemic, according to NAR. Another county with a large influx was Suffolk County, New York, home to the tony Hamptons.

In contrast, New York County (Manhattan) and Texas counties Travis, Harris and Dallas Counties (home to the cities of Austin, Houston and Dallas, respectively) lost the most people.

Atlas Van Lines, a large provider of corporate moves, saw a dramatic drop in companies relocating employees last year and a rise in the number of people doing it on their own.

The rise of remote work brought on by the pandemic is a major reason for the shift away from big urban centers, according to Schellenberg.

But despite the rollout of vaccines and optimism about a return to work, Schellenberg expects that shift to continue as many companies permanently adopt remote work.

""The pattern [in 2021] will be similar to what we saw in the past year,"" Schellenberg said. ""People will be moving away from coastal areas where there is a higher cost of living and going to places like Idaho, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee."""
Two Republican senators vow to keep open mind in Trump's second impeachment trial,"(CNN) Two Republican senators said Sunday they'll remain fair jurors and listen to the evidence presented during former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial set to begin February 9.

Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a moderate Republican, told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" that he believed Trump's comments leading up to the Capitol attack were partly responsible for the violence and that he'll keep an open mind.

""I have said with regard to the President's comments that day that they were partly responsible for what happened for the horrible violence on Capitol Hill. I've also said that what he did was wrong and inexcusable. I've used the word inexcusable because that is how I feel. We'll see. I am a juror and will keep an open mind but I think the constitutionality issue has to be addressed,"" said Portman, who won't seek reelection after his term ends in 2022.

Another moderate Republican, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, separately told Fox News Sunday he would wait to make a decision about his vote based on the evidence presented in the trial.

""The evidence is, as I understand, going to focus on whether or not the President contributed to an atmosphere to have people charge the Capitol, break-in, threatening, if you will, both members of Congress and Vice President (Mike) Pence. So I would hope that whatever defense is put up refutes that charge,"" he said.

Prince Harry wins 'significant damages' in legal dispute with UK newspaper,"London (CNN Business) Prince Harry has settled a legal dispute with the Mail on Sunday and the MailOnline, accepting what his legal team called ""significant damages"" over an article alleging he had turned his back on the Royal Marines.

Jenny Afia, a lawyer for the The Duke of Sussex, said in a statement to open court on Monday that ""the baseless, false and defamatory stories published constituted not only a personal attack on the Duke's character, but also wrongly brought into question his service to this country.""

The Duke has requested any damages received go to the Invictus Games Foundation, ""so he could feel something good had come out of the situation,"" his lawyer said. The settlement amount was not made public.

The Invictus Games were founded by the prince for wounded members of the armed forces. Prince Harry served in the British military, and flew combat missions in Afghanistan

The Mail on Sunday published the article ""Top General accuses Harry of Turning his Back on the Marines"" on October 25, 2020, and the MailOnline published an almost identical piece.

NASA astronauts conduct the second spacewalk of the year,"(CNN) Astronauts Mike Hopkins and Victor Glover Jr. conducted a spacewalk Monday to finish battery upgrades and install high-definition cameras outside of the International Space Station.

Although the astronauts began the spacewalk later than expected at 7:56 a.m. ET, they worked through their list of tasks quickly and even accomplished some ""get-ahead"" items that were planned for future spacewalks.

The spacewalk ended at 1:16 p.m. ET and lasted for five hours and 20 minutes.

This is the second spacewalk for the duo in just a matter of days.

It was the second spacewalk experience for Glover, who is a few months into his first spaceflight on the station.

Europe talks the talk in criticizing Putin. Russia's opposition is waiting for it to walk the walk,"(CNN) Josep Borrell, the European Union's foreign policy chief, is charging headfirst into a diplomatic nightmare this week, as he touches down in Moscow for a scheduled meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

The meeting, which had been in Borrell's diary for some time, comes after another weekend of protests across Russia over the ongoing detention of Alexey Navalny , currently the most famous critic of President Vladimir Putin.

Borrell won't need reminding that Navalny is lucky to be walking the earth, as Russian agents allegedly tried to kill him via a poisoning in the summer of 2020. Russia denies involvement in Navalny's poisoning. Putin himself said in December that if Russian security services had wanted to kill Navalny, they ""would have finished"" the job.

After a five-month recovery in Germany, Navalny returned to Moscow on January 17, but was arrested after landing , allegedly for violating his parole. On Tuesday of this week, a court decides if his 3.5-year suspended sentence on fraud charges should be converted into a jail term.

The optics for the EU are not great. The fact that Borrell's visit will go ahead -- despite the protests and continued imprisonment of Russia's most prominent opposition figure -- with no pre-conditions has enraged critics of the EU's relationship with Russia.

""If the EU is serious about having a dialogue with Russia and not just with a group of thugs around Putin, then Borrell should have made meeting with Navalny a pre-condition,"" said Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russia-based opposition politician who has been poisoned twice in the past five years.

Criticism aimed at Brussels doesn't come exclusively from Russia. Even within the bloc there is frustration at the contrast between the EU's lofty ambitions to promote democratic values and human rights around the world and its friendly relations with wealthy autocrats.

""With Turkey, China and Russia, we appease them by reaching fudged deals that set precedents of letting them get away with human rights abuses and rigging elections,"" a European diplomat told CNN. ""We have become distressingly comfortable with taking the moral high ground but not walking the walk.""

Europe does indeed have complicated relations with Turkey, China and Russia. A complex mix of geography, security, and economics mean that Brussels must have a transactional relationship with all three. What's unique about Russia for Europe is Moscow's naked ambition to be a regional rival in Eastern Europe.

The question of what, exactly, Europe can do about Russia comes up often. For the time being, the answer seems to be very little. A cynic might take the view that this all boils down to money.

""There is no doubt that the EU has the mechanisms to clamp down harder on wealthy Putin cronies, on European banks who hold and launder money from Russian oligarchs and on Russian firms linked to the Kremlin,"" said Steven Blockmans, director of research at the Centre for European Policy Studies. ""The problem is political will. Lots of European nations have major business interests in Russia as well as inward investment from Russia.""

The best-known of these interests is Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline that would connect Russia to Germany and provide a third of the EU's gas requirements. Gazprom, the state-owned Russian gas giant, is the project's sole shareholder.

The pipeline exposes an odd quirk in the dynamic of the EU's member states and how they differ in attitudes to Russia. ""Nord Stream 2 is highly controversial among the member states as they either vehemently reject it or vehemently support it,"" said Velina Tchakarova, head of institute at the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy.

Tchakarova went on to explain that the ""bloc of the Central and Eastern European countries, which are also members of NATO, is in favor of a much tougher stance,"" but that the traditional, wealthier European powers such as Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands want ""a more balanced position due to their strong trade interests and economic ties.""

France's Europe minister called on Germany to scrap the Nord Stream 2 project on Monday, in the light of Navalny's detention.

""Sanctions have already been put in place, we could impose others, but we must be clear, it is not enough,"" Clement Beaune told French radio station France Inter.

""It is necessary to go further, the option of Nord Stream 2 is being considered, but it is a German decision since it is located in Germany and we have always said that we have the greatest doubts regarding this project,"" Beaune added.

After the poisoning of Navalny, some speculated that there would be consequences, including for Nord Stream 2. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated last week that she was happy for the pipeline to go ahead. Worse, in the aftermath of his poisoning, only six individuals were sanctioned, and when Navalny was arrested in January, the most Brussels could muster was a series of statements condemning the arrest.

Money and business interests might be at the core of Europe's Russia problem. However, it's also true that Putin has political allies within the EU, complicating how effectively Europe can influence Moscow.

""In Hungary, Italy, France, even the Netherlands, Putin has admirers in the political mainstream, which makes any kind of united position on punishing Russia impossible,"" explained Blockmans.

The opposition in Russia is also frustrated at the fact the EU does have the tools to hurt Putin and his inner circle directly, yet opts instead for sanctions that miss the target.

""A lot of these sanctions end up hitting the Russian people more broadly and missing the guiltiest crooks,"" said Kara-Murza. This backfires on two fronts as it hands the Kremlin the propaganda win of claiming that the Russiaphobic West is hurting the Russian people.""

Tchakarova is not optimistic that stronger measures will be taken any time soon. The ""cancellation of Nord Stream 2, the targeting of Putin's inner circle, cutting off political ties and diplomatic isolation could work,"" she said, but are ""unrealistic, given the current complexity of global affairs.""

This global picture is the final piece of the puzzle in understanding why Putin's Russia is such an insoluble problem for Europe.

""Europe's relations with Russia have been difficult since 2008 when Russia invaded Georgia. Since then, we've witnessed Russia's annexation of Crimea, war in Donbas as well as Russia's tireless support to the Assad-regime in Syria,"" said Urmas Paet, a member of the European parliament and the former Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs. ""In addition, there have been numerous reports on the intimidation of the Russian political opposition, journalists and human rights activists. With its actions, the Kremlin demonstrates that it does not care how it's seen or fear the consequences of its actions.""

Putin's aggression overseas has granted him influence in key regions, especially the Middle East. Even if he is an untrustworthy partner, the EU has to acknowledge that he is a strategic partner.

This is certainly how some less hawkish EU officials justify their position. ""Geography is stubborn. Everyone agrees the Navalny situation is very serious, but if you want stability on the continent and elsewhere, dialogue with Russia is essential. All of the big member states understand this,"" said one EU diplomat.

Brussels officials accept it is complicated. From their perspective, they have to juggle Putin's domestic oppression, international aggression, the interests of their own citizens who share a continent with Russia while accepting that the EU is the closest thing to a regional superpower that can stand up to Moscow. They think, not unreasonably, that That's all well and good, but the EU's tightrope act has led to a situation where its foreign policy chief might have to endure the embarrassing spectacle of an all-smiles meeting just hours after Russia's most prominent critic is jailed on questionable charges.

When Borrell meets with Lavrov, he will no doubt raise a range of uncomfortable issues. The problem is the only person feeling uncomfortable will be Borrell.

The EU will not discuss further sanctions on the Russian Federation until March. It's unlikely those sanctions will go after Putin in any meaningful way. And, unless the Russian President has a Damascene conversion, Borrell's visit will be forgotten before his plane's even left Moscow."
January was America's deadliest month,"A version of this story appeared in the February 1 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday

(CNN) January was the deadliest month of the pandemic in America: At least 95,245 people died from Covid-19.

And the situation doesn't look likely to turn a corner anytime soon. Even in a best-case scenario, close to another 200,000 Americans are likely to die between now and May 1 , according to a new projection from the University of Washington.

While officials scramble to get more vaccines into arms, the most optimistic forecasts suggest that many, if not most, Americans will have to wait until the summer to get a shot . And it's a race against time as two new highly contagious strains of the coronavirus spread in the United States.

Health experts are urging all Americans to step up social distancing and mask-wearing -- with President Joe Biden introducing a federal mask order and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considering a double-mask recommendation.

There's also a clamor for more testing. The new administration has issued tighter testing requirements for international travel and is debating whether to require testing for domestic travel, too.

""The emergence of variants underscores the need for public health action. First, get vaccinated when it's your turn,"" the new CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, told a White House briefing last week.

""Second, wear a mask. Practice social distancing and wash your hands. And finally, now is not the time to travel. But, if you must, be safe and follow the CDC guidance.""

But public health experts are pessimistic that Americans are going to change their ways, one year into the pandemic.

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.

Q: Should you wear two masks?

A: Public health officials are suggesting Public health officials are suggesting double masking as a way to increase the level of protection from the coronavirus and its multiple, more contagious variants.

""If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective, and that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version of an N95,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, now chief medical adviser to Biden, told NBC.

Whatever mask you wear, be sure to do so properly -- including while double masking. No uncovered noses are allowed. Both masks should go over the bridge of the nose, below the chin and be flush on the face, resting along the skin, experts say.

Biden faces dilemma over Republican offer on Covid-19 rescue plan

President Biden will on Monday meet with 10 Republican senators who have drawn up a smaller counter-proposal to his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue plan, in the most critical test yet of his core promise to forge unity at a time of bitter division. But hopes for a rare bipartisan deal at the start of a new administration still look doubtful. Their plan is less than a third of the size of the economic shock treatment the White House says the nation needs.

The President must now evaluate whether the new Republican offer is a good faith opening bid in an effort to find common ground, or a bluff-calling exercise that would cause lasting damage to a new President's authority and political capital if he were to accept it, Stephen Collinson writes

WHO team investigating pandemic visits Wuhan wet market

A team of World Health Organization (WHO) investigators researching the origins of the coronavirus tell CNN they now have months of Chinese influenza data which might contain vital clues as to the early spread of the virus, Nick Paton Walsh and Sandi Sidhu write

On Sunday, the team visited the wet market thought to be central to the disease's spread: The now disinfected and shuttered Huanan seafood market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, where an initial cluster of pneumonia-like illnesses were noticed by doctors in mid-December 2019. The market has become the anecdotal 'ground-zero' for Covid-19, even though later studies have suggested it may have begun elsewhere.

The team visited the Centers for Disease Control in Hubei on Monday. They are also scheduled to go to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where they are expected to meet She Zhengli, the virologist known as ""Bat Lady"" for her lengthy investigation of bat coronaviruses, which scientists say are a close cousin to SARS-COV-2. The Wuhan Institute has gained notoriety after a series of unsubstantiated, evidence-free claims by senior Trump officials that the laboratory was the source of the virus.

A fight between the EU and UK reveals the ugly truth about vaccine nationalism

The UN General Assembly in September last year was a pivotal moment in the pandemic, when leaders began to show some unity as global deaths approached a million. They had learned hard lessons from the damage that hoarding protective equipment had done, they said. When a vaccine was developed, the world's most vulnerable would be first in line, they claimed.

The vaccines are now here and that solidarity has frayed. Between the United Kingdom and the European Union, it has disappeared entirely and given way to an all-out battle over who is more entitled to tens of millions of doses produced by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca. Meanwhile, many countries in the global south have yet to administer a single vaccine.

The ugly vaccine nationalism that the WHO and other public health advocates feared is here. And it's beginning in Europe, the region that usually boasts the world's greatest levels of equality by many measures, Angela Dewan writes

ON OUR RADAR

Tom Moore, the World War II veteran who raised millions for a UK charity by walking laps of his garden before his 100th birthday, has been hospitalized with Covid-19 and pneumonia, his daughter Hannah said on Twitter Sunday.

AstraZeneca will deliver additional Covid-19 vaccine doses to the EU and increase its manufacturing capacity on the continent, the European Commission President said on Sunday.

Hundreds of people were dispersed or detained at protests against pandemic restrictions in Hungary, Austria and Belgium over the weekend.

The Department of Homeland Security said Sunday that Transportation Security Administration workers now have the authority to enforce President Biden's transportation mask mandate.

A single coronavirus case in Western Australia has triggered a five-day lockdown for 2 million people.

Pakistan is battling a tsunami of Covid-19 patients with few vaccines in sight.

Antibodies that protect against the coronavirus can be passed through the placenta from mother to infant, a new study suggests.

High case rates, new variants, teacher union negotiations, and elaborate and costly protocols for safe school reopenings all complicate a return to pre-pandemic life for kids.

Experts agree that a widely available pediatric vaccine would simplify the process, but we don't know when we can expect it and whether it's necessary for a safe return.

All of that means that parents must brace themselves for another uncertain summer and fall. Here's how to prepare your kids to do the same

Melvin Capital hedge fund lost 53% in the GameStop frenzy,"New York (CNN Business) Melvin Capital, a premier Wall Street hedge fund entangled in the frenzy over GameStop (GME), lost 53% in January, a source familiar with the matter told CNN Business.

Melvin, a major short-seller of GameStop, bet that the company's shares would drop. But, on January 11, GameStop announced new board members who could help it with digital sales. That set off a fury on Reddit , namely subreddit WallStreetBets, which catapulted GameStop's stock more than 1,600%.

Hedge funds like Melvin with huge short positions in GameStop and other stocks targeted by WallStreetBets got burned. The Reddit group specifically targeted stocks that were heavily shorted. At one point, GameStop had more short interest than shares on the market.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Melvin's losses.

Melvin Capital was founded by Gabe Plotkin, and it started the year with roughly $12.5 billion in assets. It ended the month with more than $8 billion after receiving commitments from current investors for more capital in the final days of the month, the source said.

GOP lawmaker launches new PAC to reclaim Republican Party after Trump,"Washington (CNN) GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger on Sunday announced a new ""movement"" to push back on the Republican Party's embrace of former President Donald Trump and retire the ""poisonous conspiracies and lies"" that defined his administration.

In a six-minute campaign-style video posted to the new "" Country First "" website, which is funded by Kinzinger's Future First Leadership Political Action Committee, the Illinois Republican asserts: ""The Republican Party has lost its way. If we are to lead again, we need to muster the courage to remember who we are.""

""We need to remember what we believe and why we believe it,"" he continued. ""Looking in the mirror can be hard, but the time has come to choose what kind of party we will be, and what kind of future we'll fight to bring about.""

The effort from Kinzinger marks a notable escalation in his struggle to set a new course for the GOP after four years of the Trump administration. He was one of 10 Republicans who joined all House Democrats in voting to impeach Trump earlier this month for ""incitement of insurrection"" in light of his role in encouraging the January 6 riot at the US Capitol

""I did it knowing full well it could very well be terminal to my career,"" Kinzinger said of his vote during an interview with CNN's David Axelrod on "" The Axe Files "" podcast. ""But I also knew that I couldn't live with myself having, you know, try to just protect it and just felt like the one time I was called to do a really tough duty, I didn't do it.""

Trump names two new lawyers for impeachment trial a day after his defense team collapsed,"(CNN) Former President Donald Trump's office announced that David Schoen and Bruce L. Castor, Jr. will now head the legal team for his second impeachment trial, a day after CNN first reported that five members of his defense left and his team effectively collapsed.

One point of friction with his previous team was Trump wanted the attorneys to focus on his election fraud claims rather than the constitutionality of convicting a former president.

Trump has struggled to find lawyers willing to take his case as he refuses to budge from his false claims. Trump's advisers have been talking to him about his legal strategy and he keeps bringing up election fraud for his defense, while they have repeatedly tried to steer him away from that, according to a source familiar with those discussions.

It's unclear whether Schoen and Castor will go along with what Trump wants.

""Schoen has already been working with the 45th President and other advisors to prepare for the upcoming trial, and both Schoen and Castor agree that this impeachment is unconstitutional - a fact 45 Senators voted in agreement with last week,"" the release said.

Myanmar's military has detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a coup. Here's what you need to know,"(CNN) Myanmar's military seized power of the Southeast Asian country in a coup on Monday, after detaining the country's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and numerous other top government figures.

In a television address, the army announced that power had been handed to the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and that it was declaring a national state of emergency for one year.

Suu Kyi and several state ministers are being detained in the capital Naypyidaw, according to a spokesman for the governing National League for Democracy (NLD).

An armed military soldier stands guard in front of the regional government office in Yangon, Myanmar, on February 1.

The move comes after months of increasing friction between the civilian government and the powerful military, known as the Tatmadaw, over alleged election irregularities.

The two bodies have attempted to share power since the 2015 elections, Myanmar's first openly contested poll since the end of military rule. That power sharing relationship now appears to be over following Monday's coup.

Here's what you need to know about the situation.

Who is Suu Kyi? What is Myanmar's political system?

Suu Kyi was once celebrated as an international democracy icon. A former political prisoner, she spent 15 years under house arrest as part of a decades-long struggle against military rule.

Her release in 2010 and subsequent election victory five years later were lauded by Western governments as landmark moments in the country's transition to democratic rule after 50 years of the military regime.

However, despite embarking on some democratic reforms and installing a quasi-civilian government under General Thein Sein in 2011, Myanmar's military was not keen to relinquish their power. The ruling junta drafted a constitution in 2008 that made sure the military would continue to wield significant political and economic influence, regardless of future administrations.

Under this constitution, the military is allocated a quarter of seats in parliament and it retains control of key ministries like home affairs and defense. The military also has veto power on any attempts to amend the constitution.

It's within this framework that Suu Kyi and the NLD first formed a government in 2015. She was elected to office under the title of state counsellor -- which had been invented as a loophole, since the military-drafted constitution barred her from becoming President.

Allegations of genocide against the Rohingya

After her 2015 victory, Suu Kyi's tenure was quickly marred by difficulties in making real progress with the peace process that aimed to end the country's many ethic civil wars.

Suu Kyi also came under fire internationally for failing to speak out against numerous atrocities allegedly carried out by the military against Rohingya Muslims in western Rakhine state. Hundreds of thousands of the persecuted ethnic minority were forced out of western Myanmar into neighboring Bangladesh during violent military operations in 2016 and 2017.

Suu Kyi has repeatedly denied these charges, siding with military and labeling the accusations "" misinformation .""

Her government and the military are now facing a genocide investigation at the International Court of Justice.

However, domestically she remained popular, especially among the Bamar ethnic majority. In November 2020 the NLD won another resounding victory at the polls, awarding Suu Kyi a second term.

What triggered the coup?

Monday's crackdown is centered around November's parliamentary election.

The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) performed dismally in the poll, prompting the party to demand a new vote , claiming bias and ""unfair campaigning.""

The military also repeatedly disputed the election results. It claims, without providing evidence, that there are more than 10.5 million cases of ""potential fraud, such as non-existent voters"" and called on the election commission to publicly release the final polling data.

Last week, a military spokesperson warned it would ""take action"" if the dispute wasn't settled, and refused to rule out staging a coup.

The election commission has denied there is widespread voter fraud.

But the threat of military intervention prompted international leaders, including the United Nations Secretary-General to voice concern -- and the military appeared to back down , claiming that its comments had been misinterpreted.

By Monday, it became clear that the military had seized power in a coup.

What's the situation on the ground? What's next?

Suu Kyi, the President, and other cabinet members are being detained in their official residences, according to a spokesperson for the NLD. Suu Kyi is ""feeling well"" and walking around her home, said the spokesperson.

Myanmar's first Vice President and former general Myint Swe was installed as the country's acting President on Monday.

In its television address, the army said it had detained Suu Kyi and other political leaders for failing to take action over unfounded election fraud and had declared a state of emergency for one year. Power was transferred to the commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing, who will carry out an investigation into voting irregularities, according to the announcement.

Justifying the coup, the military cited a section of the constitution that said in the event of a state of emergency, as is the case now, the commander-in-chief has the constitutional right to ""take over and exercise State sovereign power.""

Later on Monday, the military said it will hold a ""free and fair"" election after the election commission has been ""re-constituted"" and the voter lists have been investigated, and will return power to the winning party. It did not specify when the elections would be held.

It's hard to say what will come next, especially since there has been widespread disruption in internet and news access across the country -- which could affect the ability of people to get information or organize any response via social media.

Netblocks, which monitors internet blackouts around the world, said that real-time network data showed a major drop in connectivity in the early hours of Monday morning. At one point, the only operational TV channel was the Myanmar military-owned television network Myawaddy TV.

Banks across the country were also temporarily shut down, with operations ceased until the internet connection improves, according to a statement from the Myanmar Bank Association.

Doctors at several hospitals across the country have pledged to go on strike from Wednesday, to protest the coup.

What have world leaders said?

World leaders and international organizations were quick to voice alarm and concern.

The United Nations Security Council will discuss Myanmar in private consultations Tuesday morning, according to its latest schedule, which has been updated following the coup.

US President Joe Biden called on Myanmar's military leaders to ""immediately relinquish the power they have seized, release the activists and officials they have detained, lift all telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence against civilians.""

Biden threatened to review sanctions on Myanmar, saying the US removed sanctions over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. ""The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action,"" Biden said in a statement.

Other countries, including Canada, India, Japan, the UK, New Zealand and Australia, have also released statements calling for de-escalation and the release of those detained.

Australia on Monday called for the immediate release of Suu Kyi and other senior leaders who are being detained by the military.

In a statement, Marise Payne the Minister of Foreign Affairs said, ""The Australian Government is deeply concerned at reports the Myanmar military is once again seeking to seize control of Myanmar.""

""We call on the military to respect the rule of law, to resolve disputes through lawful mechanisms, and to release immediately all civilian leaders and others who have been detained unlawfully,"" the statement said.

Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed concern, saying in a statement that it urged ""all parties in Myanmar to exercise self-restraint and put forth dialogue in finding solutions to challenges so as not to exacerbate the condition.""

In the Thai capital of Bangkok, protesters gathered outside Myanmar's embassy on Monday. Video from Reuters showed some demonstrators burning a picture of Myanmar's army chief.

Myanmar shares a border with Thailand, which experienced a coup in 2014 when its military overthrew the government.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet Monday, ""I condemn the coup and unlawful imprisonment of civilians, including Aung San Suu Kyi, in Myanmar. The vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released.""

Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said they are ""learning more about the situation"" and that China is ""a friendly neighbor of Myanmar, and we hope that all parties in Myanmar will properly handle their differences under the constitutional and legal framework and maintain political and social stability.""

""The military's actions show utter disdain for the democratic elections held in November and the right of Myanmar's people to choose their own government,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director of the international NGO Human Rights Watch, in a statement. ""We urge concerned governments to speak out forcefully against the military's actions and consider targeted sanctions against those responsible.""

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled Aung San Suu Kyi's name in the headline. This story has also been updated to reflect that Suu Kyi's government and the military are facing a genocide investigation at the International Court of Justice."

India cuts internet around New Delhi as protesting farmers clash with police,"New Delhi, India (CNN) Internet access remained blocked Monday in several districts of a state bordering India's capital following violent weekend clashes between police and farmers protesting controversial agricultural reforms .

Online access would be suspended in at least 14 of 22 districts in Haryana state near New Delhi, until 5 p.m. Monday, according to the Department of Information and Public Relations of Haryana on Sunday. That order was first imposed Tuesday in three Haryana districts for 24 hours, but has been extended every day since.

A 48-hour internet shutdown was also imposed in three other areas around Delhi's borders late on Friday, with India's Ministry of Home Affairs saying the move was ""in the interest of maintaining public safety and averting public emergency.""

According to officials, those blackouts should have lifted on Sunday night, but Paramjeet Singh Katyal, a spokesperson for Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body representing protesting farmers, said the internet was still not working as of Monday.

Demonstrators gather at the Singhu border as farmers protest against new farm laws, on January 30, 2021 in New Delhi, India.

The internet restrictions came after violent scenes last week as demonstrations continue against three agricultural laws passed in September. Since late November, hundreds of thousands of protesters have gathered on the outskirts of New Delhi to demonstrate against changes they say they weren't consulted on and which will hurt their livelihoods.

On Tuesday last week -- a national holiday known as Republic Day that marks the anniversary of the enactment of the country's constitution -- thousands of protesters stormed New Delhi's historic Red Fort as police used tear gas and batons against the demonstrators.

Dozens of officers were injured and one protester died when a tractor overturned during the protests near Delhi police headquarters, police said Wednesday. More than 100 protesters are still missing, Samyukta Kisan Morcha said Sunday.

An internet shutdown was also imposed in areas around New Delhi from midday to midnight on Tuesday.

Darshan Pal, a leader from Samyukta Kisan Morcha, condemned the internet shutdowns, calling the moves ""undemocratic.""

""The government does not want the real facts to reach protesting farmers, nor their peaceful conduct to reach the world,"" Pal said in a statement Sunday. ""It wants to spread its false spin around farmers. It is also fearful of the coordinated work of the farmers' unions across different protest sites and is trying to cut off communication means between them.""

Nevertheless, farmers are still joining the protests, Samyukta Kisan Morcha's Katyal said Monday. ""Typically these village groups work against each other but this time they have all united for the collective fight,"" Katyal said.

Additional deputy commissioner of police in Delhi, Jeetendra Meena, said police had deployed more forces at the border in case any protests break out Monday.

Concerns over democracy

Although India is the world's most populous democracy, it also topped the world in terms of internet shutdowns in 2019, according to Access Now, an advocacy group which tracks internet freedom.

In 2019, the government imposed a months-long internet blackout in Indian-controlled Kashmir after India rewrote the constitution to remove Kashmir's protected autonomy.

That same year, authorities shut down internet in other areas, including in parts of New Delhi , amid widespread protests against a controversial citizenship law considered by many to be discriminatory against Muslims.

The approach is controversial. In India, some individual shutdowns have been challenged in the courts, and there is an ongoing effort to change the country's laws to make such blackouts more difficult to impose.

The shutdowns also come against the backdrop of rising concerns about press freedom in India.

Demonstrators gather at Ghazipur, on January 30, 2021 in New Delhi, India.

On Saturday, Mandeep Punia, a freelance journalist covering the protests, was arrested on the border between Delhi and Haryana, Punia's lawyer Akram Khan told CNN Monday.

Punia has been remanded to judicial custody for 14 days from Sunday, accused of obstructing a public servant from discharging his duty and voluntarily causing hurt and assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from duty.

""(The) accused was merely carrying out his journalistic duties and another journalist was detained along with him but was released around midnight,"" according to an application for Punia's bail.

But Delhi police's Meena said Punia was not carrying an ID card when he was caught in a scuffle between villagers and protesters. Meena said Punia incited the farmers and pushed police.

Devdutta Mukhopadhyay of Internet Freedom Foundation, a non-governmental organization, said the government was using ""extremely draconian"" measures and the internet suspension was disproportionate. Online access remains restricted in the majority of Haryana, which impacts not just protesters but citizens who have been forced to work and study from home due to the coronavirus pandemic.

She said there had been reports of mob violence against protesters, and added that it was important for farmers to put forward their side of the story as unbalanced reporting could foster a negative opinion among the public.

The shutdown could set a ""very dangerous precedent,"" she added.

""It's not like you are taking down specific posts or pages that you think are false or inflammatory, this is you shutting down an entire medium of communication.""

Last week, India's Congress Party, along with 15 other Opposition parties, wrote a joint letter, condemning the way the protesters had been handled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, calling their response ""arrogant, adamant and undemocratic.""

Why farmers are protesting

The massive farmer protests have been a significant challenge to Modi as months of demonstrations and sit-ins across the country against his key agricultural policy have grown into a stalemate marked by deadlocked talks between farmers and his administration.

For decades, the Indian government offered guaranteed prices to farmers for certain crops, providing long-term certainty that, in theory, allowed them to make investments for the next crop cycle. The new rules allow farmers to sell their goods to anyone for any price -- giving them more freedom to do things such as sell directly to buyers and sell to other states.

But farmers argue that the new rules will leave them worse off by making it easier for corporations to exploit agricultural workers, and help big companies drive down prices. While farmers could sell crops at elevated prices if the demand is there, conversely, they could struggle to meet the minimum price in years when there is too much supply in the market.

The laws have been so contentious because agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India's 1.3 billion population, and farmers have been arguing for years to get the minimum guaranteed prices increased. They are the biggest voter block in the country -- making farming a central political issue.

The government has held rounds of talks with leaders of more than 30 farmers' unions that are opposed to the laws -- but the talks have gone nowhere.

Last month, India's Supreme Court issued an order putting the three contentious farm laws on hold and ordered the formation of a four-member mediation committee to help the parties negotiate. But farmers' leaders have rejected any court-appointed mediation committee.

According to Samyukta Kisan Morcha, at least 147 farmers have died during the course of the months-long protests from a range of causes, including suicide, road accidents and exposure to cold weather. Authorities have not given an official figure on protester deaths."
Silver is surging but users on WallStreetBets say they're not behind the rally,"New York (CNN Business) The silver market is the latest flashpoint in the Reddit mania that took over Wall Street last week.

Meanwhile, retail sites warned customers over the weekend they could not meet skyrocketing demand for silver bars and coins. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it is monitoring the silver markets and ""remains vigilant in surveilling these markets for fraud and manipulation."" And ""#silversqueeze"" is trending on Twitter.

However, it's not clear who the Reddit users are — nor whether their market moves match the claims online.

In fact, some posts on WallStreetBets late Sunday and Monday suggested their movement is being co-opted by hedge funds and there is no coordinated effort in the silver market.

""The Silver Squeeze is a hedge-fund coordinated attack so they can keep fighting the $GME fight,"" one thread was titled.

The post said that buying silver ""would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in.""

Senator Elizabeth Warren raised this concern Sunday as she called for the SEC to investigate.

""We actually don't know who all the players are in all this — whether there's big money on both sides,"" Warren told CNN.

Coeur Mining CDE Pan Am Silver PAAS In more recent trading, silver futures were up about 9%. Shares of precious metals minerrallied more than 20%, whilerose 11%.

Last week the group appeared to set its sights on silver.

""SLV will destroy the biggest banks, not just some little hedge funds,"" one WallStreetBets user wrote. Another claimed JPMorgan Chase has been ""suppressing metals for a long time. This should be epic. LOAD UP.""

The Winklevoss twins, who famously sued Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and were early backers of bitcoin, both tweeted support for the push by WallStreetBets into silver.

""The #silversqueeze is a rage against the machine,"" Tyler Winklevoss tweeted

""If silver market is proven to be fraudulent, you better believe gold market will be next,"" Cameron Winklevoss tweeted.

Leading retail sites posted warnings over the weekend that they faced heavy demand.

""Due to unprecedented demand on physical silver products, we are unable to accept any additional orders on a large number of products, until global markets open Sunday evening,"" APMEX, which calls itself the world's largest online retailer of precious metals, wrote in a notice atop its website.

SD Bullion warned that ""due to unprecedented silver demand"" it would also be unable to accept orders until Sunday evening. Similar notices were posted by Money Metals and other websites.

""It's not surprising to see the sharp and abrupt uptick in consumer demand overwhelm the physical supply of silver coins held by dealers in the short term,"" Ryan Fitzmaurice, a commodities strategist at Rabobank, told CNN Business in an email.

However, unlike GameStop and other unloved stocks targeted by WallStreetBets, silver futures have been strong of late. Hedge funds and other institutional investors had been bullish on silver futures and the precious metal was trading near multi-year highs.

""It is a dramatically different market setup,"" Fitzmaurice said. ""I am not sure how well this new Reddit trading strategy will fare in futures markets and especially the notoriously volatile commodity markets."""
"Analysis: After a decade of freedom, Aung San Suu Kyi returns to detention","Hong Kong (CNN) During 15 years under house arrest, Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi transformed from a national figure into a global icon of democracy, winning the Nobel Peace Prize and a host of other accolades.

She was finally released in 2010, and five years later, military rule ended as the country held its first free elections in 25 years, in which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide

Suu Kyi's victory was lauded within the international community, where it was viewed by many as a triumph of democratic values over the forces of authoritarianism. But true democracy requires more than a single election victory.

The constitution which abolished the military junta maintained for the generals a huge amount of power and influence, leaving Suu Kyi and the NLD in a delicate position as they tried to maintain democratic rights, while avoiding tilting the country backwards into military rule.

This tension was most evident in how Suu Kyi responded to a crackdown by the security services in the western state of Rakhine, from where almost a million ethnic Rohingya have fled and the army has been accused of ethnic cleansing and other horrific crimes like gang rape, torture, extrajudicial killings.

While Suu Kyi had little direct authority over actions by the security forces, her public defense of the military -- she has called reports of acts of genocide ""misinformation"" and blamed problems in the region on ""terrorists"" -- saw her denounced overseas, and stripped of numerous titles she won as a democracy campaigner.

Despite this, Suu Kyi remained highly popular in Myanmar itself, and some observers saw her refusal to criticize the military as a necessary pill to swallow to maintain civilian rule. Whether due to compromise or actual belief in what she was saying, it all turned out to be for little this week, as the military seized power in a coup , arresting Suu Kyi and other NLD leaders.

Ten years after her initial release, Suu Kyi now appears to be heading back to where her rise to international prominence began: in detention, her fate at the whims of the Tatmadaw, the military which has ruled over Myanmar for most of the last 50 years.

The circumstances of her arrest this time are far different, however. Suu Kyi is no longer ""Asia's Mandela,"" as she was once called. Her complicity in the atrocities against the Rohingya saw her hemorrhaging allies in the West, with even longtime friends denouncing her and calling on her to speak out against the military.

""The West has gone very cold on Aung San Suu Kyi which makes it challenging to back, or speak out strongly, for the National League for Democracy in the same way as the US and Europe did in the 1990s to mid 2010s,"" said Tamas Wells , an expert on Myanmar at the University of Melbourne, adding that figures in the military ""definitely know this and see that she has less leverage with the international community now.""

While the military gave up some power in the transition to partial democracy, it maintained a tight grip over defense and security matters, including in Rakhine, where soldiers have been accused of burning villages during so-called ""clearance operations,"" mass rapes, killings and other atrocities

The United Nations estimates that at least 10,000 people were killed in the crackdown since 2016, which was launched after small scale attacks on border posts and police checkpoints by a Rohingya militant group. Some 720,000 people have fled into neighboring Bangladesh, where they have been housed in the world's biggest refugee camp, at severe risk of malnutrition, flooding and more recently, the coronavirus pandemic

Suu Kyi leaves the Suvarnabhumi International airport on her first international trip in 24 years outside Burma May 29, 2012 in Bangkok, Thailand.

In response to reports coming out of Rakhine, the United States has sanctioned multiple senior Myanmar military figures , including Commander-in-Chief General Min Aung Hlaing, who the junta said will lead the country after Suu Kyi was deposed.

This growing pressure had seen both the military and Suu Kyi's civilian government growing close to Beijing , a formerly strong ally during the junta years which had lost out to Washington as the country transitioned to democracy.

Speaking to CNN Monday, Melissa Crouch, an expert on Myanmar at the University of New South Wales, said that the generals may see such alliances as a potential counterweight to any international outrage that might come as a result of the coup.

""Myanmar has China and Russia on their side, they are not worried about Western democracies,"" she said, pointing to recent visits by delegations from both Beijing and Moscow ahead of the coup.

Wells, the University of Melbourne expert, said that Myanmar's military elites ""learned very well how to bunker down in the face of international criticism.""

""And it is arguable that the strong sanctions (on the) regimes of the 1990s and 2000s by the West didn't do a lot to shift the stance of military elites at the time,"" he added. ""Covid has obviously taken a toll on the economy and there are already targeted sanctions in place. So there are not a lot of obvious levers for the West to pull.""

The biggest challenge to the coup will come internally, Wells said, and will depend on the military's ability to control an activist community and middle class that is considerably empowered since 2015, as well businesses and others who have benefited from the international engagement that came after the transition to democracy and will be unwilling to see the country slip back into pariah status.

""In Myanmar there are a lot of people making a lot of money, and they will be pressuring military elites to not disrupt the growth and stability that there has been in the cities,"" he added.

And while she has fallen from grace in the eyes of the West, she remains enormously popular among regular citizens in Myanmar. During November's elections, her party, the NLD, claimed to have won far more than the 322 seats needed to form a majority in parliament, and potentially more than the 390 seats it took in its 2015 landslide, though the military immediately accused the party of unspecified fraud.

Suu Kyi seen in parliament in November 2012.

On Monday, a statement purporting to be from Suu Kyi and published on her party's official Facebook account called for people to protest against the coup, though there were questions about the statement's authenticity.

""The actions of the military are actions to put the country back under a dictatorship,"" the statement said. ""I urge people not to accept this, to respond and wholeheartedly to protest against the coup by the military.""

Suu Kyi has not been seen since she was detained early on Monday morning. The statement ends with her name but is not signed, and it was unclear how Suu Kyi would issue a statement while in detention.

As the coup unfolds, its leaders appear to be making a concerted effort to prevent Suu Kyi's supporters and other opponents of military rule from organizing against them. As well as Suu Kyi and other senior NLD leaders, there were reports of arrests of numerous members of parliament, representatives of ethnic groups, and human rights activists.

Writing on Twitter , Kelley Currie, a former US State Department official, said that ""they seem to be 'rounding up the usual suspects' not because they are part of the NLD, but because they have a history of organizing the people, getting them in the streets, and they want to preempt that sort of thing.""

""Last time they pulled a coup, there was no (Facebook), no actual internet to speak of in Burma. Mobile phones cost $2,000 for a Nokia. Nobody had computers or cars. It was a different Burma,"" she wrote, adding that senior military figures ""may not realize this because they are still kind of disconnected from society.""

At least someone was aware of the potential for the internet to serve as a means to organize resistance however. As the coup was unfolding Monday morning, internet and phone coverage was cut off in parts of the country, and television stations were blocked or forced offline, as people scrambled to try and find out what was going on.

Thant Myint-U, author of ""The Hidden History of Burma,"" wrote on Twitter that watching developments unfolding, ""I have a sinking feeling that no one will really be able to control what comes next.""

""And remember Myanmar's a country awash in weapons, with deep divisions across ethnic (and) religious lines, where millions can barely feed themselves,"" he added."
Joe Biden faces presidency-defining dilemma over Republican offer on Covid-19 rescue plan,"(CNN) President Joe Biden will on Monday meet with 10 Republican senators who have drawn up a smaller counter-proposal to his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue plan in the most critical test yet of his core promise to forge unity over bitter partisan lines .

But hopes for a rare bipartisan deal at the start of a new administration still look doubtful because the offer pushed by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and her colleagues has a potentially fatal catch. It is less than a third of the size of the economic shock treatment the White House says the nation needs.

Biden's original legislation proposes direct payments to most Americans and extends unemployment benefits until September as it seeks to plug a huge hole in the economy caused by the pandemic. It also raises the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, fulfilling a major campaign promise. The plan provides hundreds of billions of dollars to expand Covid-19 testing, to improve the rollout of vaccines and to get kids back in school.

The President must now evaluate whether the new Republican offer is a good faith opening bid in an effort to find common ground, or a bluff calling exercise that would cause lasting damage to a new President's authority and political capital if he were to accept it.

And while Biden is keen to prove his capacity to make a divided Washington work, he knows he risks fracturing support from Capitol Hill Democrats if he significantly downsizes his own plan to win Republican support in the Senate.

While welcoming the willingness of the 10 Republicans to engage with the President, the White House is also subtly underscoring that a plan that is well short of Biden's ambitions will not be acceptable.

""As leading economists have said, the danger now is not in doing too much: it is in doing too little. Americans of both parties are looking to their leaders to meet the moment,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement on Sunday evening.

The senators said in a joint statement Sunday that they appreciated Biden's quick response to their proposal and had accepted an invitation to meet the President at the White House on Monday afternoon.

The Republican's $618 billion plan includes funding for vaccines, testing, small businesses, unemployment insurance, direct payments, child care and schools, according to a summary of the proposal obtained by CNN.

The Republican plan is expected to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office likely Monday afternoon, leading to the release of more of the plan's details.

The intrigue over the Covid relief negotiations adds another high-stakes confrontation to an already tense and combative moment on Capitol Hill as the political forces that will shape the first two years of the Biden presidency emerge. Fierce mistrust between Democrats and Republicans in the House — over personal safety in the wake of the January 6 insurrection incited by former President Donald Trump -- means any hope of bipartisan negotiation on Covid relief is all but unthinkable. Trump's move to assert control over the House caucus, with his meeting last week with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and his call over the weekend with QAnon supporter and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is sure to inject new poison into the political atmosphere.

And prospects for cross party talks in the Senate are hardly rosy, as the chamber gears up for Trump's impeachment trial next week in which it is already clear sufficient Republicans to avoid a two-thirds majority intend to acquit him over the most outrageous attack on the US government by a President in history.

Biden meanwhile will seek to keep up the momentum of his first few weeks in office with a major foreign policy address (rescheduled from Monday until later in the week owing to a snowstorm) and with new initiatives to tackle the jobs crisis.

Democrats ready to move despite GOP offer

Democratic leaders in Congress are this week already set to go down a route that would trigger a controversial budget procedure known as reconciliation to pass the $1.9 trillion rescue bill with no GOP votes — a move Biden critics would be sure to seize upon to argue that his offers of unity and negotiations are hollow. Reconciliation is a measure that allows the swift passage of laws related to the budget, spending and debt. It is controversial because it would allow Democrats to pass the package with a simple majority and get around Republican blocking tactics rooted in the 60-vote supermajority needed to get most legislation through the chamber.

The new President's dilemma is exactly the kind of scenario that he said on the campaign trail that he would be able to navigate with his decades of Senate experience. The extreme political circumstances in which his first significant dealmaking will take place explain why many key Washington players, on either side of the aisle have long been skeptical of his bipartisan aspirations.

With Democrats pushing to use their slender majorities in the House and Senate to act fast, Biden must also consider how to turn down any GOP bid he deems insufficient to avoid crushing any future cross party coalitions.

The Republican plan includes commitments from 10 senators — a sufficient number for the Senate to pass it under normal rules and for Biden to tout a rare victory that would unite a Democratic President and a significant group of GOP members. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on whom Biden hopes to coax into future bipartisan efforts are among senators who have signed up to the counteroffer.

Any hope for an agreement however probably rests on whether the Republican plan is an opening bid in a negotiation that could see its prize raise significantly or is a symbolic gesture that was never designed to succeed.

If that is the case, the Republican plan will come to look little more than an effort to ease pressure on the party to produce its own version of a credible rescue plan and a trap to split the new President from his party.

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, Brian Deese, the director of Biden's National Economic Council, said that the President's plan was a direct fit for the scale of the challenge facing the economy.

""We're in a unique crisis. And the elements of this plan really were designed and are designed to take on that crisis head on,"" Deese said, referring to the worst economic year since the aftermath of World War II, a million new first time unemployment claims, and 30 million Americans with too little food to eat.

On top of that dire reality, Deese also warned that the rescue plan needed to be sufficiently large to speed up the administration of vaccines to end the pandemic and to help millions of kids get back to school.

""We're certainly open to input from anywhere where we can find a constructive idea to make this package as effective as possible. But the President is uncompromising when it comes to the speed that we need to act at to address this crisis,"" Deese said.

Later on Sunday, after Biden met his advisers to discuss the relief package, a senior administration official said Biden was open to some negotiation but that the $600 billion Republican plan is ""not going to scratch the itch.""

Offering a carrot to the GOP group, the official told CNN's Pamela Brown that the President is specifically willing to discuss waiving stimulus checks for families making more than $150,000 per year.

One complication is that the smaller GOP plan would likely force the White House to return to Capitol Hill for new extensions in unemployment benefits in a matter of months — at a time when an already treacherous political climate will likely have worsened and will make agreement even more difficult to forge.

Initial indications were that Capitol Hill Democrats have little appetite for the GOP counterproposal at a time when many are warning that swift action is mandatory to stop the economy sliding into an even deeper hole.

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told the New York Daily News that the Republican offer was insufficient.

""They should negotiate with us, not make a take-it-or-leave-it offer,"" he said.

And Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said on ABC News ""This Week"" that he believed Democrats had sufficient votes to pass the bill by using reconciliation.

Signs that bipartisanship will prove impossible

The gap between two conflicting visions of the size of the crisis and the measures that might fix it was on display when CNN's Dana Bash interviewed Ohio Sen. Rob Portman — who is among the 10 Republican senators who signed on to the smaller, alternative plan — on ""State of the Union.""

""It is extraordinary to me that you have a great speech ... at the inaugural, talking about the need to heal and the need for us to work together as a country, Republican and Democrat alike, and a pledge to do more outreach to Republicans, and then the next day landing on our desks a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 package, when, only a month ago, we passed a $900 billion Covid-19 package that was entirely bipartisan,"" Portman said.

Portman also criticized the potential use of reconciliation — even though Republicans used it in the last administration to push through Trump's massive tax cut bill and in an effort to invalidate the Affordable Care Act -- saying the move could tear the country apart.

Many Democrats however are likely to calculate that most Americans are hardly going to be alienated by an obscure parliamentary procedure. For them, passing the bill in its entirety without Republican support is not just vital to shore up a deeply destabilized economy but is a crucial moment that must be used to display Democratic power in Washington at the opening of the new presidency. And there will be concerns of a repeat of the scenario that played out during efforts to pass the ACA during the Obama administration. The former President spent time trying to accommodate some GOP goals -- a process that delayed the bill for months, but then the Republican Party rejected it anyway.

And unless Biden can persuade Republicans to significantly increase their offer, his own need to demonstrate his authority and to get to grips with a crisis that will define his presidency is likely to weigh against his hopes to win GOP votes he doesn't strictly need."
One person is dead after a mall shooting in Wisconsin,"(CNN) One victim is dead and a second suffered minor injuries Sunday after a shooting at the Fox River Mall in Grand Chute, Wisconsin.

The suspect is believed to have left the scene before law enforcement arrived, Grand Chute Police Public Information Officer Travis Waas said during a press briefing Sunday.

Multiple law enforcement agencies responded to the mall around 3:30 p.m. local time to calls of shots fired inside one of the mall's main corridors, according to Waas.

The department is not identifying the victim at this time.

Law enforcement agents are in the process of completing their secondary search of the mall to locate and escort patrons who sheltered during the incident.

"North Korea's Kim Jong Un cannot denuclearize, former diplomat says","Seoul, South Korea (CNN) North Korea's former acting ambassador to Kuwait believes Kim Jong Un will not give up his nuclear arsenal, but may be willing to negotiate an arms reduction for relief from the international sanctions crippling Pyongyang's economy.

In his first interview since defecting to the South more than a year ago, Ryu Hyeon-woo told CNN that ""North Korea's nuclear power is directly linked to the stability of the regime"" -- and Kim likely believes nuclear weapons are key to his survival.

Ryu also said previous US administrations had boxed themselves into a corner by demanding denuclearization up front in negotiations with the totalitarian state.

""The US can't back down from denuclearization and Kim Jong Un cannot denuclearize,"" he added.

The former diplomat, who adopted the name Ryu upon moving to the South, is one of several high-profile North Korean officials to defect in recent years. The country's top diplomat in Italy fled to South Korea in 2019 , and Thae Yong-ho, the former deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom, defected in 2016. Thae has since been elected to South Korea's National Assembly.

Ryu and his family defected to South Korea in September 2019, but their actions were only made public last week. Determined to give their teenage daughter a better life, Ryu said he and his wife planned their escape for about a month while living in Kuwait.

Ryu said that if they had been caught, North Korean agents would have quickly taken them all back to Pyongyang for certain punishment, as defection is considered a major embarrassment to the Kim regime and is not taken lightly.

They finally told their daughter about the plan while pretending to drive her to school.

""Come with Mom and Dad to find freedom,"" Ryu recalled telling his daughter. ""She was shocked, then said, 'Okay.' That's all she said.""

Ryu took his family to the South Korean embassy in Kuwait to claim asylum. They traveled to South Korea several days later.

Defection from North Korea comes at a monumental cost, with defectors having to instantly sever ties from all family left in their home nation.

The regime often punishes nuclear and extended families of defectors to deter people from leaving, Ryu said -- especially diplomats. Those posted abroad are often forced to leave a child at home as a hostage, ensuring their parents do not defect.

""I think that North Korea having such feudal collective familial punishment in the 21st century is appalling,"" Ryu said.

He is now worried about his three siblings and 83-year-old mother still in North Korea. ""I just want to see them live long,"" Ryu said. ""Any thought of them being punished for what I've done just hurts my heart.""

He also worries for his wife's elderly parents living in Pyongyang.

Ryu and his wife both came from North Korea's ruling elite. His father-in-law ran Office 39, a branch of the North Korean government a former employee likened to a ""slush fund"" for the Kim family. Nominally, it is in charge of getting hard currency for the cash-strapped regime.

North Korea has long been accused of using its embassies as cash cows for the ruling Kim family. Ryu said that while he was a trained diplomat dealing with politics, there were also ""economic trading workers"" assigned to diplomatic posts. They were given a quota on the amount of money they must make for the state, Ryu added.

North Korea's former acting ambassador to Kuwait Ryu Hyeon-woo. CNN blurred the faces of the others in this picture to protect them from possible reprisals.

Kuwait was a particularly important revenue stream for Pyongyang, as the Persian Gulf nation used to employ about 10,000 North Korean laborers. Those workers were allegedly treated like modern-day slaves , and experts say almost all of their earnings were funneled back to the government, paying for Kim regime priorities such as the nuclear program.

Ryu said only China and Russia were bigger cash earners for the regime from North Korean laborers than the Gulf nations of Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE -- at least until 2017, when the United Nations punished Pyongyang for its repeated missile and nuclear tests by barring nations from employing its workers.

""Due to the UN resolution, most laborers in the Gulf region left,"" he said.

Ryu also was posted to Syria, a close ally of North Korea, from 2010 to 2013. While Ryu was charged with overseeing relations with Syrian politicians, his countrymen were selling conventional weapons to the Bashar al-Assad regime, including long-range multiple launcher artillery and anti-aircraft weapons systems. However, Ryu said the country's bloody civil war forced Pyongyang to pull its personnel from the country. He said he had not heard of any new weapons deals with the Syrians since leaving the country.

Ryu's experience in the Middle East gave him an up-close look at how the United States dealt with Iran's nuclear program during former President Barack Obama's administration. He believes that experience will come in handy for US President Joe Biden.

""Based on his experience resolving the Iranian nuclear issue, I have no doubt he'll be able to handle North Korea's nuclear issue wisely,"" Ryu said.

Ryu said he believed North Korea may be willing to negotiate a reduction in its nuclear weapons, but is unlikely to ever give them up entirely. However, he said sanctions may have played a factor in pushing North Korea to the negotiating table in 2018, when Kim and former US President Donald Trump met for their historic summit in Singapore.

Weapons that appear to be submarine-launched ballistic missiles are shown during a military parade celebrating the 8th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang on January 14, 2021.

Many analysts believe Kim came to the negotiating table because he had already developed nuclear weapons and successfully tested a long-range missile that could reach United States territory.

""The current sanctions on North Korea are unprecedented and strong,"" Ryu said. ""I think sanctions against North Korea should continue.""

Ryu also said it is important not to abandon the issue of human rights, which was largely swept under the carpet during nuclear talks with the Trump administration.

Pyongyang claims to be a socialist paradise and denies allegations of gross human rights violations. North Korea, however, does not allow freedom of speech or assembly, and citizens cannot leave. Kim's regime is accused of running a system of gulags and political prison camps that house more than 120,000 men, women and children.

""Human rights is a matter of morality, and in the North Korean regime, the human rights issue is a sensitive and serious one,"" Ryu said.

Looking back over the past 16 months, Ryu says his only regret is what might happen to his remaining family members back in Pyongyang. He and his wife believe they did the right thing for their daughter, by taking her away from her home country.

Ryu told CNN he asked his daughter what she likes most about her new home. ""I like the fact that I can use the internet as much as I want,"" she replied."

Aung San Suu Kyi and ruling Myanmar politicians detained after military seizes power,"(CNN) Myanmar's powerful military has taken control of the country in a coup and declared a state of emergency, following the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior government leaders in early morning raids Monday.

The country woke up to widespread internet and communications blackouts, closed banks, and soldiers in army fatigues patrolling the streets of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon. Residents turning on their television sets could only access the military-owned Myawaddy TV channel, with all other news channels seemingly blocked.

As news filtered through that the country's democratically-elected leaders had been detained in the capital, a news anchor announced on the military-owned channel that power had been handed over to army chief Min Aung Hlaing.

In the address, the military confirmed it had detained the country's de facto civilian leader Suu Kyi, along with other high ranking National League for Democracy (NLD) leaders, in response to alleged voting irregularities in November's election.

Later on Monday the military announced the removal of 24 ministers and deputies from the government. The military has named 11 replacements, who will assume their roles in a new administration. That announcement was also made through Myawaddy TV.

Suu Kyi's party, the NLD claimed an overwhelming victory in that election, taking 83% of the vote, which granted it another five years in government. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party won just 33 out of a possible 476 seats.

The coup came just hours before the first session of the new parliament was set to open, and follows weeks of worsening political tensions in the country over the disputed election amid rumors that the military could take over.

A soldier stands guard on a blockaded road to Myanmar's parliament in Naypyidaw on February 1, 2021, after the military detained the country's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the country's president in a coup.

A statement purportedly from Suu Kyi was published on her party's official Facebook account, calling for people to protest against the coup on Monday, though there were questions about the statement's authenticity.

""The actions of the military are actions to put the country back under a dictatorship,"" the statement said. ""I urge people not to accept this, to respond and wholeheartedly to protest against the coup by the military.""

Suu Kyi has not been seen since she was detained early on Monday morning. The statement ends with her name but is not signed, and it was unclear how Suu Kyi would issue a statement while in detention.

Suu Kyi is being held at her official residence, according to her party's official spokesperson.

""She's feeling well -- walking in the compound frequently,"" Kyi Toe said Monday in a post on his personal Facebook page.

Monday's events have been widely condemned internationally, with the United States calling on Myanmar's military leaders to ""immediately relinquish the power they have seized, release the activists and officials they have detained, lift all telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence against civilians.""

President Joe Biden threatened to review sanctions on Myanmar. ""The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action,"" Biden said in a statement.

He called the situation a ""direct assault on the country's transition to democracy and the rule of law,"" and called on the international community to ""press the Burmese military to immediately relinquish the power they seized.""

Army chief Min Aung Hlaing, who is now running the country, has been under US sanctions since December 2019. He was designated for serious human rights abuses related to the atrocities committed against the Rohingya Muslim community.

On Monday, Min Aung Hlaing's office released a statement saying that elections will take place only after the election commission has been ""re-constituted"" and the voter lists have been investigated.

""A free and fair multiparty general election will be held and then, state responsibilities will be handed over to the winning party meeting norms and standards of democracy,"" the statement said.

Prominent Myanmar historian and author Thant Myint-U said on Twitter Monday that, ""The doors just opened to a very different future.""

""I have a sinking feeling that no one will really be able to control what comes next. And remember Myanmar's a country awash in weapons, with deep divisions across ethnic and religious lines, where millions can barely feed themselves.""

What led to the coup

The November election was only the second democratic vote since the country emerged from 50 years of isolationist military rule in 2011.

The military has alleged that voter fraud took place during the poll, which delivered a far bigger majority for Suu Kyi's party than many had anticipated, including those in the military.

Last week, a military spokesperson said it would not rule out a coup if the unfounded allegations of voter fraud were not properly investigated. On Monday it moved to act on that claim, reasserting its authority with the arrest of numerous political leaders for ""failing to take action.""

Myanmar's election commission had previously rejected the allegations made by the military, saying any errors, such as duplicated names on voter lists, were not enough to impact the result of the vote.

The sudden coup has surprised some observers, who point out that the military already wields significant power.

In 2008, the ruling junta drafted a constitution that allocated 25% of legislative seats to the military as well as control of key ministries such as defense and home affairs, and a veto power on constitutional issues.

United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for Myanmar, Tom Andrews, told CNN that the coup is a ""real mystery.""

""They wrote the constitution that they just overthrew. It gives them enormous power, economic power, political power,"" he said. ""So how and why they overturn their own constitution is incredible.""

Andrews said their action is ""extremely damaging"" and comes at a time when many in the country are suffering extreme hardships because of the coronaviorus pandemic. He said sanctions and international pressure should ""be ratcheted up soon and quite vigorously.""

""The people of Myanmar have been through so much. They've lived through decades of brutal military rule. They are going through a pandemic. The economy is in tough shape for so many. It's so incredibly unfair for them to have to go through this right now,"" he said.

The United Nations Security Council will discuss Myanmar in private consultations Tuesday morning.

Military soldiers and vehicles are seen inside the state-run Myanmar Radio and Television office compound, in Yangon, on February 1, 2021.

No clear end game

The arrest of Nobel laureate Suu Kyi marks a potentially volatile moment for the fledgling democracy.

Though her international reputation has been tarnished in recent years by allegations of genocide against the Rohingya, the former democracy icon remains enormously popular in Myanmar where she commands broad and loyal support, especially among the country's majority Bamar ethnic group.

Suu Kyi spent 15 years under house arrest as part of a decades-long fight against military rule. Five years after her release, she led her party to a landslide victory in Myanmar's 2015 elections, establishing its first civilian government after decades of isolation and military authoritarianism.

On Monday human rights non-government organization Burma Rights UK said in a post to their Twitter that the news of Suu Kyi's detention was ""devastating.""

""This needs to be met with the strongest international response. The military need to be made to understand that they have made a major miscalculation in thinking they can get away with this,"" the group said.

Melissa Crouch, law professor at University of New South Wales, Australia and author of ""The Constitution of Myanmar"" said it was still unclear what the military's end game is.

""This week was supposed to be the meeting of the new government, so the inauguration of the new government. Instead, all of the members of parliament, many of the chief ministers, have been arrested. We know that at the moment, that at least 30 people have been arrested, possibly more,"" she said, adding that the whereabouts of Suu Kyi are unknown.

The former UN special rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee pointed to the fact that Min Aung Hlaing, who has a lot of foreign investments, is set to step down later this year. He is also being investigated by the International Criminal Court for crimes of genocide against the Rohingya.

""He is desperate to keep his economic holdings on Myanmar, and he is desperate to stay in power because, otherwise, he will need to face charges within the international court, the international court of justice, and other international courts,"" Lee said.

""This dreadful event will definitely hamper the democratic process of Myanmar,"" she said, adding that the international community ""needs to cut all relations with Myanmar."""
Why Senate Democrats may struggle in 2022,"(CNN) The retirement announcement this week from Sen. Rob Portman is a sign that even as we just finished one election, another one is right around the corner. Democrats seemed to be pleased that the Ohio Republican is stepping aside because beating an incumbent senator is hard.

Still, I wouldn't be jumping too much for joy if I were the Democrats.

To be clear, It's not that the map is great for Republicans -- and it's still very, very early. But history suggests Democrats have their work cut out for them if they want to maintain or expand their majority of 50 seats (with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the ties).

The simple fact is that while there are exceptions (e.g. 2018), midterms tend to be tough for Senate candidates of the party controlling the White House.

Now, there is some good news for Democrats. Of the 14 seats Democrats need to defend , the only seat without an elected incumbent running so far is in California with appointed Sen. Alex Padilla. In midterms since 1982, the opposition party has never picked up a seat that leaned as much against the opposition party (compared to the country as a whole) in the prior presidential election.

Further, there are no Democratic elected incumbents running in states President Joe Biden lost. Back in 2018, there were 10 seats Democrats had to defend in states 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lost.

The problem for the Democrats becomes apparent by comparing what looks like the best three pickup opportunities for Democrats to the best three for Republicans.

The bad news for Democrats is that three of the Democratic seats that are up in 2022 are in states where Biden underperformed his national margin (Arizona, Georgia and Nevada).

White House party incumbents running in states where their party underperformed nationally in the previous presidential election have had decent, but not great, success in midterms. The incumbent party is 30 for 41 (73%) in these seats since 1982.

This 73% may seem impressive, but it's really not.

Take a look at what are probably Democrats' best pickup opportunities. These are in the three battleground states where Republican senators have announced their retirements : North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Biden underperformed his national margin by 3 points or more in all of these states in 2020.

The opposition party has won 31 out of 34 (91%) of open seats since 1982 in which the president underperformed his national margin in the previous presidential election.

The only times the opposition party didn't win these was when Joe Manchin, then West Virginia's governor, ran and may have acted as a pseudo incumbent in 2010 or when the president's approval rating was above 60% and Indiana's Evan Bayh won in 1998 and Minnesota's Norm Coleman won in 2002.

Either way, you don't need to be a statistician to know 91% is larger than 73%. This isn't determinative by any stretch, though it does put Democrats in a less desirable position than Republicans.

Expanding our horizons to look at all seats up this cycle, we find similar math.

There are just 10 elected Democratic incumbents who are up in states where Biden did better than he performed nationally.

The White House party has won 78 out of 93 seats (84%) in midterms with an elected incumbent of the same party running in a state where the president outperformed his national margin in the previous presidential election.

Again, that may seem like a lot, but put that 84% into perspective.

Right now, Republicans have 17 of their 20 senators who have not said they're retiring up for election in 2022. They're all running in states where Biden underperformed his national margin.

Opposition party elected incumbents have won 83 out of 84 midterm races (99%) since 1982 in states where the president underperformed his national margin in the previous presidential election. The only loss was Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina in 1998, when then-President Bill Clinton had an approval rating of above 60%.

LIke in our previous case with arguably the most vulnerable seats for both sides, the less vulnerable Democratic seats are still more vulnerable than the less vulnerable Republican held seats.

A potential saving grace for Democrats is that there are more Republican seats up for grabs.

The real problem for Democrats, however, is that while the map isn't awesome for Republicans, it doesn't seem like Democrats have the same counterbalance to the usual midterm penalty that Republicans had in 2018.

Republicans are defending 20 seats, not 26 seats like the Democrats were in 2018 . They are defending zero seats in states where Biden outperformed his national margin, not the 12 Democratic-held seats in states where the Republican president, Donald Trump outperformed his national margin.

The bottom line is Democrats are likely going to need a significantly better national environment than Republicans got in 2018 in order to repeat the feat of holding onto their Senate majority. That's possible, though it's not something that I'd necessarily bet on."
Google CEO and HBCU leaders discuss talent pipeline for Black tech workers,"New York (CNN Business) Leaders of five historically Black colleges and universities met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Friday to discuss the company's relationship with the schools in the wake of anti-HBCU-graduate discrimination allegations made by a former Google employee.

On December 21, ex-Google diversity recruiter April Curley tweeted that she had been fired by the company in September after repeatedly raising concerns about how the tech chain evaluates black college graduates.

In recent interviews with CNN Business, Curley maintains that her former Google superiors believed HBCU computer science grads don't have the technical skills needed for successful Google tech careers and that they regularly resisted her attempts to get more Black college tech majors hired, although she says that's what the company hired her for.

""The first step is to help Howard students meet the Google bar -- it's also the right thing to do for the future of diversity in technology. With this huge percentage of the pool currently not hirable, we need to look at ways to impact change in the HBCU system.""

Google has declined to comment on Curley's specific workplace allegations, which came less than a month after the company parted ways with prominent artificial intelligence researcher Timnit Gebru . Both Curley and Gebru are Black women. Each of their Twitter threads recounting their Google experiences went viral in December, sparking outrage in the tech world and calling into question the renewed commitment Google made to recruit more Black employees in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd last year.

The national diversity and inclusion organization HBCU 20x20 abruptly canceled its partnership with Google in response to the controversy, which caught the attention of HBCU administrators whose schools have tech exchange partnerships with Google.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during a conference in Brussels on January 20, 2020.

Friday's meeting was arranged by Thurgood Marshall College Fund president and CEO Harry Williams, whose non-profit supports publicly funded HBCUs and other predominantly Black institutions. Williams said the presidents of Howard University, Florida A&M University, North Carolina A&T University, Prairie View A&M University and Morgan State University all participated in a 60-minute virtual session Friday night with Pichai and seven members of Google's senior leadership team about working together going forward.

""We are all encouraged about the future partnership,"" Google and the HBCU leaders said in a joint statement emailed to CNN late Friday night. ""The meeting paved the way for a more substantive partnership in a number of areas, from increased hiring to capacity building efforts that will increase the pipeline of tech talent from HBCUs.""

Williams said that Gebru and Curley's allegations about Google weren't discussed during the meeting.

""That's a personnel matter,"" he said. ""The presidents made it very clear as it relates to the students, if they send students (to Google) they had to feel good about the situation.""

Before the meeting, Morgan State University president David Wilson arranged a focus group with MSU Google tech exchange students and alumni who currently work at Google to get their feedback on how the company treats Black HBCU students and graduates.

Wilson said he told Google at Friday's meeting that what he heard from Morgan State students was mostly positive.

""One of our black female (students) did inform me she was the first Black woman to be on her immediate team there at Google and one of only two Blacks on the larger team,"" Wilson told CNN Business.""But she was never made to feel like she didn't belong ... They are having good experiences.""

Accusations of disparagement

A fall 2020 picture of Howard University's campus. The school' is one of several historically Black colleges and universities that participates in a tech exchange program with Google.

On Thursday night, Curley tweeted that Google had replaced her on its HBCU recruitment team with a White woman, leading to additional online criticism. Google declined to directly address Curley's allegation.

""We have a large team of recruiters who work incredibly hard to increase the hiring of Black+ and other underrepresented talent at Google, including a dedicated team that partners and strengthens our relationships with HBCUs,"" the company said.

Curley also accused Google staffers of writing a disparaging report about HBCU grads in 2014, the year she joined the company, according to her LinkedIn account. Curley said she has a copy of the report, which she said was titled, "" Project Bison Proposal ,"" an apparent reference to Howard University's mascot

""Google said, 'our interview feedback case studies and curricula analysis demonstrate that current HBCU (computer science) Departments are not graduating strong technical talent,'"" Curley wrote, quoting from the report, in a series of Thursday night tweets.""'HBCU CS students struggle with the most basic of coding, algorithms and data structures.'""

TO BE CLEAR THESE ARE THE WORDS OF GOOGLE. The time I spent recruiting at HBCUs says otherwise by the way. The kids at Howard and every other school I worked with are simply BRILLIANT. Period. — Real Abril🌈 (@RealAbril) January 28, 2021

Google said its Google in Residence program, which sends company software engineers to teach computer science classes at HBCU campuses, started in 2013.

""We've been very upfront about the goals of that program and how it's a partnership with HBCUs,"" a Google spokesperson said via email. ""We don't have any comments on any preceding proposals.""

Google says it has collaborated with HBCUs in multiple ways to prepare Black college students for competitive software engineer internships and full-time roles at the company, These include the company's tech exchange programs , its Howard University computer science residency, known as Howard West , and its Computer Science Summer Institute program for high school students in the United States and Canada.

Last summer, Google committed to increasing Black representation at its senior levels and improving leadership representation of ""underrepresented groups"" by 30% by the year 2025. Only 3.7% of Google's US workforce is Black, according to the company's latest diversity report . In 2019, Google says it hired graduates from 19 HBCUs.

""We've expanded our recruiting efforts to more than 800 schools,"" the company said.

Interviewed late Friday night, Curley said the Black college recruitment successes Google is touting are products of the work she and others on her team put in over the course of six years. She wasn't surprised Morgan State's students had positive things to say about their Google experiences.

""Those kids were my kids that I brought into the company,"" Curley said. ""(Google is) able to take credit for it because I laid the ground work, myself and two other Black women."""

A groundhog forecast: More winter or early spring?,"(CNN) Every year on February 2 people keep an eye out for a groundhog's shadow to help predict what the weather will be like for the next few weeks. This year that shadow may be cast on snow.

The legend goes that if groundhog Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow we will have six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring will arrive early.

Right now the outlook for Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is for snow. A lot of it. The forecast for Tuesday morning while Phil is making his prediction calls for snow showers and temperatures in the mid 20s. Winds will be whipping up to 25 mph making wind chills feel in the low to mid teens.

Even if it isn't snowing very hard during Phil's televised forecast, there will be at least 6-8 inches of fresh powder on the ground from a weekend winter storm that will make it's way through the Northeast from Sunday through Tuesday.

The celebration, which is over a century old, will look a little different this year. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there will be no crowd in attendance or guests present , but you can watch the ceremony on the internet via live-streaming.

Pakistan battles tsunami of Covid-19 patients with few vaccines in sight,"(CNN) Keeping vigil outside the hospital ward in Karachi, Daniyal Ameen watched his father breathing through a ventilator via a live video link from the intensive care unit (ICU).

He came every day to see his father, 73-year-old Muhammad Ameen, as he spent weeks on oxygen battling Covid-19

The video link was set up at the private South City Hospital in Karachi to enable relatives to feel closer to their loved ones in the ICU, as visits inside that facility are prohibited.

The screen is the closest Ameen has come to seeing his father for about 18 months. The 33-year-old flew back to Pakistan from his home in Melbourne, Australia, when his dad was hospitalized.

""Seeing him on a screen like that was pretty traumatizing for me,"" said Ameen. ""We told him that yes, I am here, and I want to see him healthy and smiling back again.""

But Ameen's father didn't survive. Instead, he became one of thousands of Pakistanis to die from the virus.

Daniyal Ameen and his father, Muhammad Ameen, at the Australian Open in 2020. Muhammad passed away from Covid-19 after being on a ventilator for two weeks in the ICU of South City Hospital in Karachi.

For many countries struggling in the Western world as winter cases surge, the arrival of vaccines has provided a light at the end of the tunnel. But in places like Pakistan, that tunnel remains in near darkness.

""The vaccine is not here in this country for the foreseeable future,"" says Dr. Nashwa Ahmad, Coordinator of Covid Services and Research and Development at South City Hospital.

""That means our health care workers still have to continue to do their jobs, (and) endless hours, without the protection of the vaccine.

""A vaccine would definitely have given us the additional boost we needed to continue on with fighting the disease.""

The hospital has been overwhelmed with ""a tsunami of patients,"" Ahmad says. The three Covid-19 ICU wards are full, and more patients are waiting in ambulances outside.

""We are full, we have patients waiting, we have families who are suffering, we have patients at home, sick patients at home, patients who are on oxygen, we just don't have space in hospitals,"" she says.

A sign at South City Hospital, a private hospital in Karachi which has stopped taking Covid-19 patients as all its ICU beds are full.

So far, Pakistan has officially recorded more than half a million cases of Covid-19, and more than 11,600 related deaths -- although health officials tell CNN that testing is not sufficient to reflect the true picture.

Pakistan has secured 1.2 million doses from China's Sinopharm, with 500,000 expected to arrive this weekend, but they will barely make a dent in vaccinating the country's population of 216 million. Health workers in major cities are due to start receiving shots next week, and negotiations are underway for vaccines from other manufacturers, says Asad Umar, the chief of the National Command and Operations Centre.

Pakistan's health minister confirmed this week that his country will also receive 17 million doses of AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine in 2021.

About 6 million of those doses are expected in the country in March with the remaining batches following in the second quarter of the year.

A 'humongous logistical challenge'

Pakistan is also pinning its hopes on COVAX, the global initiative to provide up to 2 billion vaccine doses to the most vulnerable 20% of the world's poorest populations, formed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

""This is an unprecedented effort,"" said Aurélia Nguyen, managing director of COVAX. ""We have never rolled out this number of vaccines in this short (a) time.""

The ambitious COVAX program is aimed at ensuring equitable vaccines for all, to end the ""acute"" phase of the pandemic. Rollouts are expected to start in February, although the exact timeline depends on regulatory approvals of vaccines in each country -- as well as their readiness to administer them properly.

Such an approach presents a ""humongous logistical challenge,"" especially for vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech which require ultra-cold chain refrigeration, said Benjamin Schreiber, deputy chief of the global immunization program at the UN International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).

UNICEF will help deliver the vaccines on the ground in developing countries, where it already has a presence.

""We've never seen an introduction of a vaccine to so many countries in one go, that's absolutely new, and really no vaccine has ever been deployed and introduced in so many countries so quickly,"" Schreiber said.

This uncertainty is already creating anxiety in countries reliant on COVAX, he added. ""Countries are looking at COVAX and don't see yet vaccines arriving, while they see some countries are making bilateral deals, and that creates kind of a panic,"" Schneider said.

Vaccine nationalism

Pakistan is one of 92 lower-income countries eligible for free vaccines from COVAX. Another 98 wealthier countries will also purchase doses through the organization, using it as a middle man to streamline negotiations with vaccine makers -- and to prevent vaccine nationalism.

The concept of vaccine nationalism has become a significant global concern, highlighted by the ongoing public spat between the European Union and British-Swedish drug maker AstraZeneca, which recently informed the bloc it would not be able to supply the number of vaccines the EU had hoped for by the end of March. EU leaders are furious the company appears to be fulfilling its deliveries for the UK market and not theirs.

""I think we can expect that it's not going to be all smooth sailing, as the vaccine manufacturing is scaled up and distribution happens,"" Nguyen said. ""I think it's important for everyone to be able to be accountable to the commitments that they've made.""

Nguyen said it was inevitable that initial vaccine demand would outstrip supply. ""This is exactly the reason why COVAX was created, to avoid a bidding war for vaccines,"" she added.

""Without concerted effort, lower-income countries will be left behind because of the restrictions of their financial capabilities to be able to buy vaccines.""

COVAX has so far raised $6 billion from wealthier countries and other organizations, including a giant injection of $4 billion from the US, approved by Congress in December. The Biden administration also announced it would join the global initiative

""That's been a hugely welcome move on the part of the Biden-Harris administration,"" Nguyen said. ""I think it's a very strong endorsement of the COVAX facility, of the aim to have a global and multilateral approach to fair and equitable access for Covid-19 vaccines.""

Vaccinating 20% of people in the world's poorest countries, however, won't be enough to help their populations reach herd immunity. Although COVAX plans to expand the program for as long as it is needed, analysis by the Economist Intelligence Unit suggests huge swathes of Asia and Africa will not see widespread availability of Covid-19 vaccines until 2022 or 2023.

Prime Minister Imran Khan addresses the media on March 16, 2020.

Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, addressed this issue during the UN Conference on Trade and Development on January 25, calling for more to be done to help vaccinate the developing world.

""It will take much longer for the vaccine to fully cover the global south,"" Khan said. ""The coverage of the COVAX facility must be expanded. This will enable the developing countries to spend their precious resources on socioeconomic development needs.""

Many of the richer countries self-funding vaccines in COVAX do understand the importance of a united solution to the pandemic. Singapore, for example, has pledged $5 million to COVAX to fund vaccines for poorer countries.

""This is borderless, this is a problem without a passport, it doesn't need a visa,"" says Umej Bhatia, Singapore's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office and member of the ""Friends of COVAX"" group.

""If we don't help solve this problem, we will have this problem for a longer time.""

But still, the global race to procure vaccines directly from manufacturers is gathering pace.

""Vaccine nationalism is the is the evil twin of COVAX,"" says Jerome Kim, Director General of the International Vaccine Institute. ""A lot of the countries that signed up for COVAX, the high-income countries in particular, hedge their bets by putting in pre-orders for Covid-19 vaccines.""

""(Now) COVAX is at the back of the line,"" Kim said, although he added the situation could change with wealthier countries ultimately donating excess vaccines back to COVAX.

Alarm over the growing chasm has been raised by the WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

""I need to be blunt,"" he said. ""The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure. And the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries.""

Of 39 million vaccines administered globally by January 18, Ghebreyesus said, just 25 doses were given in a lower-income country.

""Not 25 million, not 25,000, just 25,"" he said.

""I think the rich-poor divide is always going to be there,"" said Dr. Naseem Salahuddin, Head of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the public Indus Hospital in Karachi. ""We have learned to accept that the West is always privileged. Since they have invested all the money in developing the vaccines, they're going to be in the front line anyway.""

Internal divisions

As the vaccine divide grows internationally, an internal divide between the rich and poor is also expected to emerge -- and for many middle-class and wealthy Pakistanis, flying abroad might be the only option to receive a vaccine anytime soon.

The market for vaccine tourism is taking shape. An exclusive lifestyle club called Knightsbridge Circle, based in London, has started offering trips to Dubai to enable the ultra-rich to skip the vaccine queue. For its members, who pay 25,000 British pounds ($34,000) a year, the package includes flights, accommodation, and two doses of the vaccine three weeks apart.

From this week, the company is also offering a package for non-members, which starts at 10,000 British pounds ($13,685), including two doses of the vaccine plus transfers from the airport and the vaccine center. The scheme will only be available to the over-65s or those with pre-existing conditions. The founder, Stuart McNeill, said they decided to do this in the UAE because the population already has free access to the vaccine.

For Daniyal Ameen in Karachi, the option of paying for his family to receive vaccines abroad is an attractive prospect.

As well as losing his father to Covid-19, his mother was also hospitalised with the coronavirus, although she has since recovered.

""If there is an opportunity for me to get myself or my family vaccinated, of course I'm going to get that,"" he says. ""Whatever it takes to do that, because I have seen that very personally that all my family members were affected by Covid.""

As a middle-class family, they're among the lucky ones who may have the financial means to make it happen.

Pakistan's anti-vaxxers

Bigger problems may also face Pakistan -- and many other countries -- even when vaccines eventually arrive.

Misinformation about Covid-19 is rife in Pakistan. Many people refuse to believe the virus even exists, and therefore they don't plan to take a vaccine even if it is offered.

The National Library of Medicine in the US released a study in June 2020 warning that the threat of vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan would hamper the country's Covid-19 efforts -- and advised measures to counteract the ""misleading narratives."" Pakistan is ""quite vulnerable to such conspiracy narratives and has experienced failures of polio vaccination programs because of such claims,"" the study said.

Pakistan's failure to stop the spread of polio is due in part to a historical distrust of foreign healthcare providers, concerns that were inflamed after allegations surfaced that US intelligence officials had used a fake vaccination program in the city of Abbottabad as part of efforts to capture Osama bin Laden in 2011.

""My apprehension is the acceptability amongst the general population,"" says Salahuddin, from Indus Hospital. ""The average man on the street is not very impressed with the whole pandemic, they are in denial, and they may not even want to take the vaccine.""

In a bustling outdoor market in the capital Islamabad, motorbikes snake past the roadside vendors, and families mill around the stalls -- shopping for mobile phones, fresh vegetables, or snacking on fresh bread and kebabs. Masks are on sale in one stall, but most people don't wear them.

""In Pakistan, the first thing is that mostly people don't believe that corona exists,"" says customer Mohammad Armaghan, 21. ""They just won't get vaccinated.""

""There's no need for a vaccine. This corona is nothing, we have faith in Allah, we don't wear masks, we don't need any protection,"" says another customer, Ghulam Ali Chauhan.

Back at South City Hospital in Karachi, such misconceptions are what keeps Ahmad awake at night, worried that Pakistan could ultimately fail to emerge successfully from the coronavirus crisis.

""(The public) are in this impression that the disease does not exist,"" she says. ""That is a little bit scary, because then we don't see the end to the peak, we don't see the end to the disease. And with no vaccine in the near future, the peak could prolong for a very long time."""

"Covid-19 hospitalizations drop, but January has been the deadliest month of the pandemic. Here's what to expect next","(CNN) For the first time in almost two months, less than 100,000 Americans are hospitalized for Covid-19.

Sunday, the United States reported 95,013 Covid-19 hospitalizations, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project . And 97,561 patients were hospitalized Saturday. The last time the number was below 100,000 was December 1.

Yet the seven-day average of new cases is still about the same as it was December 1 . Even worse, the average number of daily deaths is more than double what it was then.

January has been by far the deadliest month of the pandemic. More than 95,245 people have died from Covid-19 so far this month, surpassing December's total of 77,486 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

""Right now it's the worst of possible worlds. It's the winter. It's getting cold out, people are together more, there's still a critical number of people in the United States who don't wear masks, who don't social distance,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisory committee.

""I think the next six weeks or two months are going to be rough. I think we could have another 100,000, 150,000 deaths.""

He's not alone in that prediction. About 120,000 more Americans could die from Covid-19 over the next two months, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

And while vaccine makers and officials scramble to get more Americans vaccinated, they're racing against the spread of highly contagious strains of coronavirus that are now in the US

More than 26.1 million US cases and at least 441,300 deaths have been reported since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University.

These worrisome strains are in multiple states

The B.1.351 strain, first identified in South Africa:

Thursday, South Carolina reported two cases of B.1.351 . Those two people had no known travel history or connection to one another, state health officials said.

Although current vaccines are believed to be protective against known variants, some research has suggested they may be less effective against the B.1.351 strain in particular.

Fortunately, there's an extra cushion of immunity caused by vaccination, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

""The good news is the vaccines as they exist now still would be effective against the mutants,"" Fauci said. ""The sobering news ... as you get more and more replication, you can get more and more of evolution of mutants, which means you always got to be a step ahead of it.""

The B.1.1.7 strain, first identified in the UK:

Scientists in the United Kingdom say this variant might be up to 70% more transmissible than others

Now the B.1.1.7 strain has been found in at least 30 US states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This spring and summer, Southern California and Southern Florida will be most at risk for the B.1.1.7 strain, said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the FDA.

""If you look at where B.1.1.7 is right now in the country, about half the cases that we're turning over are in Southern California and in Florida,"" Gottlieb told CBS's ""Face The Nation"" on Sunday. ""And the cities are the hotspots, San Diego and Miami.""

31 million doses administered

While the current Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines each require two doses, a new single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson might get emergency use authorization by late February

More than 31 million Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech doses have been administered nationwide, according to CDC data.

More than 25 million people have received at least one dose, and about 5.6 million Americans have received both doses of their vaccine.

Some states are using mass vaccination sites to get as many shots into arms as quickly as possible.

In Washington state, health officials said more than 10,000 people had been vaccinated at such sites with the help of the state's National Guard and other partners.

""The goal of mass vaccination sites is to increase access to vaccine across the state, ensure our plans are equitable, and protect those most at risk,"" a statement from Washington state's health department said.

An argument for delaying second doses

As many people as possible older than 65 need to be given their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, essentially delaying some second shots of the vaccine, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

Osterholm told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday that the change in vaccine distribution is needed to respond to a possible viral surge in the next six to 14 weeks caused by the B.1.1.7 strain first identified in the UK.

""We still want to get two doses in everyone, but I think right now in advance of this surge, we need to get as many one doses in as many people over 65 as we possibly can to reduce the serious illness and deaths that are going to occur over the weeks ahead,"" Osterholm said.

""We do know that if we get a number of first doses in people, particularly 65 years of age and older, we can really do a lot to reduce the number of serious illnesses and deaths in this next big surge which is coming,"" he said.

Even though that might delay some people's second doses, ""We're not going to deny anybody their second dose,"" Osterholm said.

Recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are supposed to get their second doses 21 days after the first dose. Those who get the Moderna vaccine are supposed to get their second doses 28 days after the first.

But the CDC said Americans shouldn't worry too much if the gap between their two doses is a bit longer than recommended.

""You should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine,"" the CDC said. ""You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval.""

The World Health Organization said people can wait as long as six weeks between doses. But Pfizer and Moderna said they don't have any data on how long people can wait between doses and still get good protection.

CDC order requires masks on public transportation

A new order by the CDC requiring people to wear masks while riding any kind of public transportation will go into effect Monday night.

The agency said public transportation operators must use best efforts to enforce the mandate, such as allowing only those wearing masks to board and disembarking passengers who refuse to comply.

People can take their masks off briefly to eat, drink or take medication; verify their identity to law enforcement or transportation officials; communicate with hearing impaired people; don an oxygen mask on an aircraft; or during a medical emergency, the CDC said.

Children younger than 2 or people with a disability who cannot wear a mask are exempt.

Transit authorities in several major US cities and states -- including New York; New Jersey; Washington, DC; San Francisco; Chicago and Atlanta -- told CNN they are already in compliance.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority told CNN ""face coverings have been required on Metro since May.""

""We welcome any policy that further promotes compliance on Metro and in all public spaces to combat the spread of the virus, and welcome the ability of TSA and other federal authorities to enforce this mandate when appropriate,"" a spokesperson said.

In California, a Bay Area Rapid Transit spokesperson said the Bay Area's public transportation system has had a face covering mandate in place since April.

And in Atlanta, a spokesperson said the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority began requiring masks in July.

The CDC order applies to all travelers, including those who have had coronavirus or the Covid-19 vaccine.

The order will stay in effect until further notice."

They say Biden's plan would change their lives. Here's how,"Marilú Saldaña would visit her mom in Mexico before it's too late.

Karina Ruiz De Diaz would register to vote -- something she's helped thousands of others do, but never had a chance to do herself.

They're among the undocumented immigrants President Joe Biden has pledged to help with a new bill he's pushing Congress to pass . The measure would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million people who've been living in limbo for years.

Undocumented immigrants across the country told CNN they're hoping the President will make good on his promise.

They shared fears about their families' safety, dreams for their futures and concerns they have about whether politicians in Washington will actually protect them. Their responses have been edited for length and clarity.

He says getting driver's licenses would be a game changer for his family

Luis Tapia says he worries for his parents whenever they leave for work.

Luis Tapia, 19 • Cook • Lives in: Wisconsin • Country of origin: Mexico

""I'm applying for DACA now. It would be great if there were protection for my parents, too, so that they wouldn't be afraid of being in this country anymore -- afraid of going out in the street, or to the supermarket, that they might get stopped without a license. It's the terror we've always lived with. We came here when I was less than 1 year old. It wasn't until the deportations under Obama were starting that they told me we didn't have papers -- that I realized any time the police could stop us and send us back to a country I don't even know.

What Biden's immigration bill would do The proposed legislation would create an ""earned path to citizenship"" for undocumented immigrants in the United States. Here's how it would work, if passed: • Dreamers, TPS holders and immigrant farmworkers would be eligible for green cards immediately. • Other undocumented immigrants could apply for temporary legal status right away. After five years, they could apply for green cards. • Green card holders could apply to be come US citizens after three years. They'd have to pass additional background checks and demonstrate knowledge of English and US civics.

""My dad is a cook and my mom is a prep cook. Whenever they go to work, that's 30 minutes of fear not knowing if they're going to get stopped. We're terrified during this time that something is going to happen to them. We're always sending each other text messages that we arrived somewhere safely or made it home.

""We'll see what happens in the next three months. We never know if something is going to change for our families, and if the changes will help us or create more terror for us. I hope it helps our family stay together and protected.

""The first thing that we would do is get our driver's licenses so we can drive wherever we want in this country and not have any problems. That's something we've always wanted, to be able to go to another state or another place without being afraid.""

He worries his aging parents won't ever be able to rest

Glo Harn Choi, shown here leading a protest march in 2019, says years of physical labor have taken a toll on his mom.

Glo Harn Choi, 28 • Community organizer • Lives in: Illinois • Country of Origin: South Korea

""If the immigration bill that President Biden is proposing were to pass as it currently stands, that would put me on a track to eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship. But I think for me what stands out particularly is the timeframe for that.

""I've had to work since the age of 15 to support our family financially. I worked in hospitality -- as a server, busboy, host, bartender, dishwasher, delivery driver, and then also I worked as a painter. And I work on the side as a photographer. That's tough, especially when you're a young guy. You see all your friends, a lot of them who just kind of want to live their youth. And I think a lot about how I wish I could have done that as well. But really what stands out is that my parents' age is catching up with them. My mom works in hospitality. She's a caterer. Every time I see her, I can see how that physical work is really taking a toll on her. I work with people that are around the same age as my mom, and my mom looks so much older than her contemporaries because of the amount of work that she has to do.

""So the timeline for this [bill], what it means to me is that I don't know if my mom has eight years left to be able to rest, to be able to retire, which I think is a right of every person to be able to rest after dedicating their entire lives to surviving. I don't want her just to live to survive.

""[As for what I would do if I became a citizen,] it's a thought that I've had to suppress for such a long time because for so long there just was no pathway. It was really just about survival. It's kind of hard to think about those kinds of things when you're really focused on not dying.

""I'd love to be able to travel to Korea. I'd love to be able to see and explore some of my roots, because I've never had that opportunity. I lost so much of myself because of something as trifling as the idea of legal status.""

She's ready to register to vote and one day return to the career she left behind

Karina Ruiz De Diaz, executive director of the Arizona Dream Act Coaliton, traveled with a group to Washington for Biden's inauguration to push for immigration to stay at the forefront of his presidency.

Karina Ruiz De Diaz, 36 • Nonprofit executive director • Lives in: Arizona • Country of Origin: Mexico

""The first thing that I would do is register to vote. I have helped so many people register to vote in the last five years, I lost count. It's more than 1,000 or 2,000 people, because I wanted them to be a voice for me. I wanted them to understand the power that they have in deciding who represents them.

""I have felt voiceless because in Arizona voters passed a law that says I have to show proof of legal residency for in-state tuition. Because of that law, it took me 12 years to graduate from college with a bachelor of science in biochemistry that I'm not using right now. I'm not working in my field because I have to be fighting this fight. My life and the lives of people like myself who qualified for DACA, and people who did not, were on the line the last four years. This fight took priority.

""I dream of going back to my field one day. I want to teach science. I want to do research. When I'm a citizen I could go back to doing that, knowing I have grown leaders in the community who can carry on the work of the nonprofit.""

He's been waiting in limbo for decades and wants to see the world

Author and filmmaker Jose Antonio Vargas has traveled around the country sharing his story as an undocumented immigrant.

Jose Antonio Vargas, 39 • Nonprofit founder • Lives in: California • Country of origin: The Philippines

""This bill is absolutely welcomed. But I'm not naive either, I know that it will be very difficult to pass this legislation. This is an uphill climb, but this is a really good start. The administration has drawn a line in the sand.

""People who I'm meeting for the first time, wherever I am -- in Mississippi or in Wisconsin or in Iowa -- the number one question I always get asked is, 'Why don't you just get yourself legal?' It never ceased to shock me how people don't understand immigration as a process. The Biden-Harris administration is making it very clear that we are making this process for people. People like me haven't been able to adjust their status because there wasn't a process.

""I cannot wait to have a US passport and be able to see the world. I would go to the Philippines and I would go see my mom. It's hard to live a life when you don't know when you can fully live it. This process is something that I've been waiting for, for decades now. And I've met people who are in their 50s and 60s who have been waiting for decades.

""Today I was thinking about this man I met years ago in Oklahoma. He was 48, and had been working construction jobs and restaurant jobs. He wrote to me and he said, 'I have been here for 25 years and I really want to know more of my country. I want to visit New York, Las Vegas, Orlando, Hollywood. But I'm afraid to go to the airport because I don't have documents.' He's not just a worker, he's an American -- he just doesn't have any documents. And he said, 'I hope one day we can fix our situation and I can know my country.' When I hear about this bill, I think of people like him.""

She wants her mom to meet her children

Marilú Saldaña, shown here at a protest for rent relief during the pandemic, is hoping Biden's immigration bill will help her family.

Marilú Saldaña, 29 • Server • Lives in: Pennsylvania • Country of origin: Mexico

""A path to citizenship would be amazing for me. The first thing I would do would be go and visit my mom who I haven't seen in 15 years. It's very sad because we both have been through difficult times. I've been really sick. She's been really sick, and I haven't been able to help her. She hasn't been able to meet my kids, her grandchildren. I'm so afraid that one day she's just not going to be in this world anymore, and I didn't even get to see her again.

""I have two kids who are US citizens. Right now I'm working on getting my GED because when my dad got deported [14 years ago] I had to drop out of school because I didn't have enough money to pay my rent and utilities. My biggest goal here is to be able to go to college. I want to be a nurse. That's all I have on my mind. I want to show my kids that it doesn't matter where you come from, you can still make something of yourself.

""I don't want to get too excited [about the bill] and get a broken heart again because nothing happened. But I feel like my mom's getting older and older. I'm also getting older. I just feel like I'm running out of time.""

She wants to feel safe when she goes outside

Morelys, who asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her family, says she's afraid of police and tries to avoid them.

Morelys, 19 • High school senior • Lives in: Maryland • Country of origin: Dominican Republic

""When we came to this country, I knew that I was going to be undocumented, but I didn't know what that meant -- just how we are treated, not being able to get health insurance. Everything around the medical system, it seems so unfair sometimes. We had to deal with Covid in our house. My mom was very, very bad at one point. She could not even breathe. But she refused to go to the hospital, because we knew what that meant. We all knew that we could not afford it.

""I want to go to college. But as an undocumented immigrant not even having DACA, a lot of the scholarships that are there for undocumented students do not even apply to me. I feel very limited about everything that I want to do. And I feel like this bill could help with that -- and also with the fear that I have every day. Every time that I come out of my house, I feel like I will be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It would be a relief for me, just going outside and being treated with the dignity that I deserve as a human being. That's basically how my life will change if this passes.

""Besides being an immigrant, I am a Black woman in this country. I am afraid of the police and try to avoid them. I've never been in situations where there are a lot of people in the same place, because I feel like if something happens, things can get out of control. I also do not travel long distances. I have family in Miami and I've never gone to see them. Because even if I take a long ride in the car, I feel like at some point I might be stopped and the police might give my information to ICE. At school, whenever there's a field trip or something like that and I feel like it will be in a place close to federal buildings, I just try to not go. That is how scared I am.""

He lived the last three years in a church. Now he's praying for Biden's plan

José Chicas prays with his family as he leaves sanctuary. For more than three years he lived on the grounds of Saint Johns Missionary Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina.

José Chicas, 55 • Pastor/business owner • Lives in: North Carolina • Country of Origin: El Salvador

""There is great hope that he [Biden] is going to help us -- millions of families. But we still have to wait and see what will happen.

""I've lived in this country for 35 years. Not having this protection has affected us in all parts of our lives.

""This would make such a big difference. With permanent residence you can leave the country and go to any other country and come back. And with citizenship, it's even better, because you can have a voice and vote in this nation.

""If I had that, I would go around helping people who need help. I would like to vote so I can support people who need it."""

Biden plans first major foreign policy speech on restoring 'America's place',"(CNN) President Joe Biden plans to deliver his most substantive foreign policy remarks since becoming president on Monday, according to a senior administration official, marking his opening attempt at pivoting away from his predecessor's ""America First"" approach to the world.

Biden's speech will center on the theme of ""restoring America's place in the world,"" one of his central campaign promises, and will coincide with his first trip to a Cabinet agency. He plans to visit the State Department to meet newly installed Secretary Antony Blinken, press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday.

Making his first stop there, rather than the Pentagon or CIA, is meant to underscore Biden's renewed focus on repairing American alliances and using diplomacy as a tool abroad, an official said.

While his speech is not expected to outline in detail the specifics of a new strategy on China, Iran, North Korea, Russia or other US adversaries, he will seek to frame his foreign policy around shoring up alliances and returning to multilateralism after the Trump administration, which was marked by unilateral actions and disdain for traditional diplomacy.

Biden has spoken by phone to roughly a half-dozen foreign counterparts since taking office but has been focused in public mainly on the coronavirus pandemic and domestic executive actions. He did rejoin the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization, signaling his intent to renew American commitments abroad.

"Disproportionate number of current and former military personnel arrested in Capitol attack, CNN analysis shows","Ormond Beach, Florida (CNN) Active military personnel and veterans are over-represented among the first 150 people to be arrested and have records released for federal offenses in the violence and insurrection at the US Capitol .

Analysis by CNN of Pentagon records and court proceedings show 21 of the 150, or 14%, are current or former members of the US military. That is more than double the proportion of servicemen and women and veterans in the adult US population, calculated from Census Bureau and Department of Defense statistics. In 2018, there were 1.3 million active-duty members of the services and 18 million veterans . Together, they comprised just 5.9% of the overall 327 million US population at the end of 2018.

Two of the people arrested are in the Army Reserve, and one is an Army National Guardsman. Of the 19 veterans, seven are former Army, eight are former Marines, two served in the Navy, one was in the Air Force, and one served in the Army National Guard. Their service records show at least one served in Vietnam; others were deployed in the wars of Afghanistan and Iraq. At least one earned a Purple Heart. They were discharged with a variety of ranks and included officers -- a captain and a lieutenant colonel.

And on January 6, the active and former military personnel are accused of declaring a war at home -- attacking the Constitution they once swore to defend, some even equipped with military gear and weapons.

Court documents show military personnel and veterans were among the crowds who stormed the US Capitol.

The world watched as hundreds of rioters stormed the US Capitol in what became a deadly insurrection. Five people died due to the events at the Capitol that day, including a police officer hit in the head with a fire extinguisher and a woman trampled to death.

Analysis of the charges faced by some of the veterans show prosecutors say they led the violence and lawlessness that disrupted the certification of President Joe Biden's election win.

There are also alleged links between some of the veterans and extremist groups.

Veterans and Proud Boys

CNN tracked down nine of the accused veterans.

The most well-known of those arrested so far is Joseph Randall Biggs . The 37-year-old is an Army combat veteran. He is also one of the leaders of the far-right Proud Boys group that is known for violent clashes with anti-fascists or Antifa during protests from Portland, Oregon, to Washington, DC.

Biggs became an online personality of the far-right, spouting bombastic and sometimes violent rhetoric toward women and Antifa.

As far back as 2012, there were a plethora of tweets mentioning sexual violence on his @RamboBiggs account, which has been archived by the Media Matters For America group

One said: ""Every Kiss begins with ... Roofies."" -- a reference to Rohypnol, the ""date rape drug.""

Biggs tweeted a rallying cry of ""DEATH TO ANTIFA"" and called on others to get guns and ammunition to take to a rally in Portland. His account was suspended by Twitter in 2019 for repeatedly violating the terms of service.

One of his self-titled online shows was still being featured on a right-wing subscription website a week after his arrest. It began with computer-generated explosions, and a tank firing out the letters B-I-G-G-S.

On January 6, Biggs is accused of going far beyond rhetoric.

The FBI used this image of Biggs in its affidavit, saying he entered the Capitol within 20 seconds of a door being opened.

In video CNN has reviewed from January 6, Biggs is seen commanding his Proud Boy troops and guiding them to the Capitol steps.

Federal prosecutors say he ""did aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, or procure others to unlawfully enter the US Capitol by means of destruction of federal property.""

He is charged with unlawful entry, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds and obstructing an official proceeding of Congress.

In the criminal complaint, federal agents say Biggs was among the first to enter the Capitol during the mob attack.

One of Biggs' Proud Boys, Dominic Pezzola, who has been charged with several crimes including conspiracy , is shown on video smashing a window of the Capitol with a plastic shield, which several people climb through before a door was opened.

Pezzola's lawyer said he was ""denied contact"" with his jailed client, which, he said, undercut his ability to mount a ""meaningful legal defense.""

""Hey Biggs, what do you gotta say,"" a voice off camera says in a video reviewed by the FBI. ""This is awesome."" Biggs replies on camera before walking into the Capitol building within 20 seconds of the door opening, the FBI agent alleged in court documents.

CNN visited Biggs' home in Ormond Beach, Florida, just north of the Daytona International Speedway, to hear what he had to say now that he is out on bail and on house arrest.

He peeked through a curtain on his door when we identified ourselves, but stayed mostly hidden.

When asked if he was an insurrectionist, Biggs replied, ""Oh God no.""

But as we pressed for why he was inside the Capitol building, he threatened to call police.

""If you don't get the f**k out of here, I'm calling the police right now,"" he said, pushing his phone around the curtain to take video.

Proud Boy and would-be politician

A four-hour drive south from Biggs is the Miami home of Gabriel Garcia, a former Army captain, now an alleged Proud Boy extremist who is also accused of involvement in the insurrection.

Last year he ran for the Florida House of Representatives as a Republican, though he told CNN affiliate WPLG at the time there were questions about the election system. ""There's people starting to doubt this process,"" he said then. Garcia lost in the Republican primary.

Now he is charged with ""certain acts during civil disorder, aiding and abetting; knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.""

The FBI alleges Garcia shot video inside the Capitol during the riot, using this image as evidence.

According to the federal complaint, Garcia was inside the Capitol when he said on a video: ""We just went ahead and stormed the Capitol. It's about to get ugly.""

The affidavit says he called police who were trying to stop the siege ""f**king traitors.""

Garcia's lawyer, Aubrey Webb, told CNN his client ""does not want anything to do with the Proud Boys or any extremist group."" He also said his client did not commit any violence or destroy any property during the Capitol riot.

""By the time he went in, the police were letting people in. And he did not go into any of the chambers, like others did. Any comments he made are protected speech, as he did not threaten anyone or intend to incite violence,"" Webb said in a statement.

'Revolution' call allegedly from dog rescuer

In the Texas city of Longview, between Dallas and the Louisiana border, Ryan Nichols lives in a gated community with large homes and big lawns.

A neighbor called police to try to stop us from approaching Nichols' house. Down the street at Nichols' wholesale business, a man refused to say if he was inside and threatened to call 911.

Nichols, 30, says in an ad that he has made ""millions of dollars here on the e-commerce platforms"" and claims he can help others do the same.

A former Marine, Nichols was once featured on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" in 2018 after video of his work rescuing dogs during Hurricane Florence was shared widely over the internet.

On January 6, federal prosecutors say Nichols was at the Capitol with a Texas buddy called Alex Harkrider, who is also a former Marine.

The FBI says Nichols can be seen on video yelling through a bullhorn towards the large crowd, ""If you have a weapon, you need to get your weapon!""

The FBI used this image and others from Nichols' Facebook page to establish what Nichols, in the camouflage hat, and Harkrider wore on January 6.

The complaint says another video shows Nichols shouting, ""This is the second revolution right here folks! [...] This is not a peaceful protest.""

A person who recognized the men told the FBI according to court documents: ""I have photo screen shots from their social media pages showing they were there and showing Alex stated they were planning a civil war.""

The complaint says Nichols had a canister of OC/pepper spray and a crowbar with him and sprayed what is believed to be pepper spray toward the Capitol entrance where federal agents were trying to stop the attack.

Federal agents obtained a Snapchat photo they said was ""apparently shared by Harkrider.""

""We're in. 2 people killed already. We need all the patriots of this country to rally the f**k up and fight for our freedom or it's gone forever. Give us liberty, or give us death,"" the caption read.

He and Nichols are charged with conspiracy and unlawful entry with a dangerous weapon, violent entry or disorderly conduct, civil disorder, assaulting a federal officer using a deadly or dangerous weapon, and aiding and abetting, according to a federal complaint.

They both remain in jail.

Purple Heart recipient lives with parents

Three hours south, in the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, Army veteran Joshua Lollar is staying with his parents as part of his bond requirements.

The home is part of a planned community with tree-lined streets and large brick homes at the ends of long driveways.

It's a far cry from Iraq, where Lollar was deployed, and from Washington, DC, on January 6.

A screen capture of Lollar's Facebook account shows a picture of people wearing red ""Make America Great Again"" hats entering the Capitol, with a caption saying ""busting in.""

The FBI complaint included selfie shots of Joshua Lollar at the Capitol.

The complaint against him said he was livestreaming on Facebook while taking part in the siege. He is also captured on police body camera video admitting to violence against officers, the affidavit says.

""Yeah, I'm good. Just got gassed and fought with cops that I never thought would happen,"" Lollar posted on Facebook, the affidavit said.

Lollar's father came out of his home, holding a small fluffy dog. After greeting CNN in a soft voice, he said, ""I can't tell you anything.""

He did confirm his son was an Iraq war veteran, awarded a Purple Heart.

Lollar told a federal court hearing he lives with his parents, is being treated for PTSD, and has been receiving disability since 2009, according to CNN affiliate KPRC , which attended the hearing. He has been charged with numerous offenses including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, obstructing or impeding law enforcement officer during civil disorder and obstructing federally protected functions.

Lollar was released on bond. The court ordered that guns, body armor and gas masks be secured by Lollar's father.

""He will have no knowledge of where they are,"" Grover Lollar told the judge, according to KPRC.

More veterans accused of conspiracy

The first people to be charged by federal officials with conspiracy in connection with the insurrection are all veterans . Jessica Watkins, who served in the Army under another name, is also accused of being part of the far-right Oath Keepers.

The complaint against her says she conspired with former Marine Donovan Crowl and Navy veteran Thomas Caldwell.

CNN has reached out to the arrested veterans mentioned in this story and any lawyers listed on their court documents. Most did not respond. Lollar's representative said his client had no comment at this time.

CNN is continuing to keep count of the number of military members arrested in connection to the insurrection, as well as police officers and others who have been trained or prepared for combat in the name of the United States.

""What we've seen too often is that this kind of ideological militancy is allowed to exist in the military,"" said former FBI agent Michael German who spent years undercover in White supremacist and domestic extremist groups and is now a fellow at the Brennan Center For Justice. ""And there isn't enough effort to root it out and to actually paint it as what it is: an anti-democratic movement that's a threat to our security within our security forces.""

But he added that the threat extended outside the armed forces and law agencies.

""It's not just the military veterans and the police officers who were involved in the violent and illegal activities, but the fact that these groups that have been engaged in militant violence across the country over the last four years and beyond have support among elected politicians.""

Correction: An earlier version of this story overstated the number of active military personnel arrested and understated the number of veterans arrested. At the time of publication, those arrested included two active military personnel and 19 veterans. Additionally, this story has been updated to reflect that those arrested were members of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard"
GOP senator calls on Republican leaders to 'stand up' against Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's comments,"(CNN) Republican Sen. Rob Portman on Sunday said his party's leaders ""ought to stand up"" against Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and that there should be ""a strong response"" to her controversial actions and recently resurfaced incendiary comments amid calls for her expulsion from Congress.

""I think Republican leaders ought to stand up and say it is totally unacceptable what she has said,"" the Ohio senator told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" ""I saw a couple videos over the weekend and one had to do with violence as I see it. There is no place for violence in our political dialogue. By the way there is no place for violence in our country. I mean, this is something we got to get away from. So yeah. I think people ought to speak out clearly.""

Asked if Greene, who has been appointed to the House Education and Labor Committee, should she be stripped of her committee assignments, Portman said the move could ""send a message.""

""I assume that is something they're looking at and I wouldn't be surprised if that happens. And you know, I think that is the way to send a message,"" he said. ""The voters who elected her in her district in Georgia, you know, ought to be respected. On the other hand when that kind of behavior occurs there has to be a strong response.""

The comments from Portman, a longtime GOP lawmaker who announced early last week that he will not seek reelection after his term ends in 2022, come amid continued fallout over Greene's past comments

Grubhub has partnered with the Girl Scouts to help safely sell cookies and teach entrepreneurship,"(CNN) With the continuation of the pandemic, the Girl Scouts of America (GSUSA) is getting creative for cookie season. Besides safe in-person sales, the beloved cookies will be sold online for a second year and, for the first time, through food delivery service Grubhub.

The national office announced the partnership earlier this month when it kicked off cookie season. The food delivery service is currently being used in select markets and additional cities are being added as the season goes on. Grubhub is waiving all fees for the Girl Scouts to make this option feasible for sales without reducing troops' and councils' proceeds, according to organization.

To kick off the partnership, Grubhub will be delivering cookies for free with a minimum purchase of $15 through February 14.

""We're proud of the resourceful ways Girl Scouts are running their cookie businesses safely and using their earnings to make the world a better place,"" interim GSUSA CEO Judith Batty said in a statement.

""This season, our girls will continue to exemplify what the cookie program taught them -- how to think like entrepreneurs, use innovative sales tactics, and pivot to new ways of doing business when things don't go according to plan.""

InfoWars' Alex Jones helped jumpstart January 6 rally organization efforts,"(CNN) Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones helped jumpstart the organization efforts that eventually materialized into the ""Stop the Steal"" rally on January 6, according to the grassroots organizer who filed the permits.

Cindy Chafian, who said she submitted the permits to the National Park Service, told CNN that Jones had reached out to her ""to make sure he was able to speak at an event that he had contributed to.""

She said she had originally submitted the permits while working for Women for America First. The group was founded by Amy Kremer, who previously worked as an executive of the conservative group Tea Party Express, and her daughter Kylie Jane Kremer.

Chafian said that because the Kremers became unresponsive and non-committal, she embarked on her own in organizing a January 6 event and eventually teamed up with Jones.

""He agreed to pay for a percentage of the event and I was to try and find someone to help with the funding gap,"" Chafian said of her agreement with Jones. ""He connected me with Caroline M. Wren because there was somebody that she knew who wanted to help contribute to the event.""

Sanders says Democrats have the votes to pass Covid-19 relief bill through reconciliation,"(CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he thinks there are enough Democratic votes to pass a massive Covid-19 relief package through a process known as reconciliation as the country grapples with the economic fallout of the pandemic.

""I believe that we do,"" the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee said when asked during an interview with ABC whether he thought there are enough Democratic votes.

""All of us will have differences of opinions, this is a 1.9 trillion dollar bill, I have differences and concerns about this bill, but at the end of the day we are going to support the President of the United States,"" Sanders added.

Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, has said that Democrats will use the move to pass the package by 51 votes in the Senate, rather than 60, if Republicans don't move the legislation.

Republicans used the reconciliation process when they attempted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in 2017 in the Senate. The GOP successfully used the process months later to overhaul the country's tax code, which passed with just Republican votes.

Biden's reversal of transgender military ban brings new hope to thousands,"(CNN) They dreamed of serving, and now they can after President Joe Biden lifted the Trump-era ban on most transgender Americans joining the US military.

Paulo Batista held onto his dream, even when it seemed impossible. Ever since high school, Batista wanted to join the military and serve his country, inspired by his father's time in the Air Force.

""My father is a first-generation immigrant,"" said Batista. ""This was some way to pay back and show love for the country. It was embedded in me, and it became a passion.""

Batista joined the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) at his Florida school, but when it came time to enlist, his father needed him. Batista's father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and he put his own life on hold to care for his family. But he made his father a promise: he too would join the military and serve his country.

Paulo Batista can now enlist in the US military after the Biden administration lifted the Trump administration's transgender ban.

Batista soon faced a different obstacle on his way to fulfilling the promise he made. After his father passed away in 2009, Batista, whose sex assigned at birth was female, began his transition to his authentic self, a man. Before he could look to serve his country, he had to look inwards.

"Hilton Valentine, guitarist of The Animals, has died at 77","(CNN) The Animals' guitarist Hilton Valentine, best known for the iconic opening riff on the English rock band's arrangement of ""The House of the Rising Sun,"" has died at the age of 77.

The band's record label ABKCO Music announced Valentine's death in a statement Friday, saying it learned of the guitarist's death from his wife, Germaine Valentine. The statement did not identify the cause of death.

Valentine began playing guitar as a teenager growing up in North Shields, Northumberland, the label said. After honing his skills playing with other groups, Valentine was recruited in 1963 to form The Animals, along with Eric Burdon, keys player Alan Price, bassist Chas Chandler and drummer John Steel.

But the Animals' take transformed the song into a rock 'n' roll hit, opening with Valentine's iconic electric guitar riff. It was a success on both sides of the Atlantic, topping charts in the UK, the US and Canada. Rolling Stone ranked it 123rd on its list of the 500 greatest songs of all time

GOP senators offer Covid-19 relief counterproposal to force talks with White House back to middle,"Washington (CNN) Ten Republican senators on Sunday announced plans to unveil a roughly $600 billion Covid-19 relief package , a counterproposal to President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion plan meant to force relief talks with the White House back to the middle.

The lawmakers, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Rob Portman of Ohio, told Biden in a letter that they devised the plan ""in the spirit of bipartisanship and unity"" that the President has urged and said they plan to release a full proposal Monday.

The Republican proposal represents the most significant response yet to the White House's planned package, though with a price tag more than a trillion dollars less than the Democratic plan, the GOP proposal will likely face opposition from congressional Democrats. The White House, however, signaled Sunday an openness to compromising on some parts of Biden's plan.

The counterproposal includes a total of $160 billion for vaccine development and distribution, testing and tracing, and treatment and supplies, including the production and deployment of personal protective equipment. It also includes a new round of direct payments for ""families who need assistance the most,"" extend enhanced federal unemployment benefits at the current level and provide $4 billion to bolster behavioral health and substance abuse.

Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of the Republicans who signed on to the letter, told Fox News on Sunday that the GOP plan includes payments starting at $1,000 -- an amount lower than the $1,400 Biden's plan provides for -- that would decrease depending an individual's income level.

An aide close to the process told CNN the plan is expected to be between $500-$600 billion, though lawmakers are still waiting to hear from the Congressional Budget Office on the estimated cost.

Portman, appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, wouldn't specify how much the group's package would cost, but said it will be ""less than $1.9 trillion,"" the cost of Biden's plan.

""You know, our proposal is an example -- it's going to have all of the health care funding that President Biden has in his proposal, all of it. So there's a lot of bipartisanship,"" he said, adding separately that ""if you can't find bipartisanship on Covid-19, I don't know where you can find it.""

Republicans devise their own plan

In recent days, it had become apparent to Republicans that the narrative taking hold suggested the Democrats had a plan for Covid relief and Republicans could either stand in the way or agree to it. They didn't feel like there was a negotiating place for them to start and the frustration among Republicans was palpable.

As the week dragged on, one idea being floated was that they needed their own alternative to present to the White House. And most importantly, they needed 10 Republicans to be on board.

One of the issues with having just the support of the so-called Sweet 16 group, is that the group of centrist senators only includes 8 Republicans, which never was going to be enough to pass any bill. They needed 10 to show there were enough willing partners to give Democrats the 60 votes needed to pass legislation in a bipartisan manner.

The letter's other signatories include Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Todd Young of Indiana, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.

One GOP aide familiar with the talks told CNN that the group worked all day Thursday and Friday, and by Saturday, they had broad agreement, but the details took time to figure out.

Any bipartisan plan will likely lose votes on the Democratic side, meaning for every progressive senator against the proposal, they'd need another Republican supporting it. Still, this idea of putting two plans side by side is one that aides and members have been discussing for several days as a way to force the conversation back to a bipartisan place.

Eight Senate Democrats from the ""Sweet 16"" group talked on Saturday about how to handle Covid relief negotiations with Republicans and how they should vote on a budget resolution this week that would unlock reconciliation -- a procedural tactic being pushed in part by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee -- and allow Democrats to eventually pass a relief bill with just 51 votes, a Democratic Senate aide told CNN.

The Democrats discussed whether voting on a budget resolution would spoil their ability to continue to work in a bipartisan fashion on a relief package. The budget vote is just the beginning of the process, but the source told CNN there is still concern that moving ahead would send a signal that Democrats are going ahead with a partisan process and potentially poisoning the well.

Portman told Bash that such a maneuver would do just that. The prospect of Democrats using reconciliation ""is not in the interests of the Democratic Party,"" he said Sunday, arguing that ""it will set President Biden down a path of partisanship that I think will poison the well for other bipartisanship we'll need on so many issues.""

The source told CNN that most members on the Democratic call were comfortable with moving forward on at least the budget resolution, but there is still work to do to get every Democrat comfortable. There is a legitimate desire to give the new President a win on his first legislative push, but concerns remain about not giving bipartisan talks enough time to fully develop.

Moderate Democrats were given a heads up that Republicans were going to release their own plan, but were not given specifics of what was included.

Ultimately, it will be up to Biden as to whether he wants to give Republicans more time for negotiations, though Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told the New York Daily News Sunday that the Republican proposal is insufficient, stating that Republicans should, ""negotiate with us, not make a take-it-or-leave-it offer.""

Biden has previously suggested he's open to passing major portions of his $1.9 trillion Covid relief proposal through reconciliation if Republicans refuse to move on the measure.

And while Biden has said he is willing to consider less than $1.9 trillion in relief, White House officials made clear they are not interested in splitting up the legislation by getting a bipartisan vote on some aspects and then passing a separate package along party lines using reconciliation.

Biden's proposed package expands on many of the proposals in Congress' $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill from March and the $900 billion legislation from December, which was scaled back to garner bipartisan support in the Senate.

A test of bipartisanship

The counterproposal will stand as an early test of Biden's stated commitment to reaching across the aisle during his time as president. In his inaugural address earlier this month, the President called for bipartisanship and unity, something the Republican senators referenced in the opening of their letter, writing: ""Heeding that important call, we welcome the opportunity to work with you in a bipartisan manner.""

The senators also requested a meeting with the President ""to discuss our proposal in greater detail and how we can work together to meet the needs of the American people during this persistent pandemic,"" adding that they ""want to work in good faith.""

Brian Deese, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, confirmed on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that the White House had received the letter and said they would be ""reviewing it over the course of the day.""

""We've received the letter and we certainly will be reviewing it over the course of the day,"" Deese said. ""What I will say is that the provisions of the President's plan, the American Rescue plan, were calibrated to the economic crisis that we face.""

The President, he added, is ""uncompromising when it comes to the speed we need to act at to address this crisis.""

And pressed on whether the White House was willing to ensure a new round of stimulus checks is targeted toward Americans who most need the money and are most likely to spend it, Deese told CNN they were ""open to that idea"" and that they ""think this plan is targeted to provide cash into the pockets of the people who are the most in need.""

Democratic Sen. Jon Tester defended the cost of the Democratic plan Sunday, saying that although it's a large amount, it is not too much, because the economic crisis caused by the pandemic is not improving.

""So, I don't think $1.9 trillion, even though it is a boatload of money, is too much money,"" Tester, who represents Montana, told CNN's Abby Phillip on ""Inside Politics.""

Asked Sunday if the White House was open to negotiating parts of Biden's proposal, Deese told CNN they were ""certainly open to ideas.""

""We welcome input to say where we may have not gotten everything right, where we could be more effective, certainly that's part of the process as we go forward,"" he said. ""But what we really need to focus on now is what do we need to get this economy back on track and what are the resources necessary to do so.""

Cedric Richmond, the director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, also signaled that Biden is open to some type of compromise on a package, telling CBS on Sunday that the President wants ""to work with both sides in order to help the American people.""

""He is very willing to meet with anyone to advance the agenda,"" Richmond said.

Powerful nor'easter nears East Coast and could bring up to 18 inches of snow to New York City,"(CNN) New York City and the surrounding region are expected to see ""major to extreme"" winter storm impacts through Tuesday due to a powerful nor'easter forecast to bring 12-18 inches of snowfall and wind gusts as high as 45-50 mph.

With heavy snow and strong winds, blizzard conditions are possible on Monday, according to the National Weather Service office in New York. The heaviest impact for the city is expected to be on Monday, when 1-3 inches of snow could fall per hour, but the storm will linger into Tuesday.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio urged residents to stay home during the storm. In-person school will shift to fully remote on Monday, and Covid-19 vaccination appointments will be rescheduled, he said.

Overall, more than 110 million Americans will feel winter's sting early this week as the nor'easter takes aim at the most densely populated cities along the East Coast.

Citing expected snow, high winds and coastal flooding, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday directed state agencies to mobilize emergency response resources.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency starting at 7 p.m.

The Emergency Operations Center has been activated, and troopers are ready to assist as needed. Power outages are expected, and state authorities are in contact with utility companies on their storm preparations, said a news release from Murphy's office.

State offices, Covid-19 vaccine ""mega-sites"" and most public transit will be closed Monday, the release said.

It's been almost two years since Washington, DC, has had a snowfall greater than 1 inch, but that could change drastically by later Sunday. The city is under a winter storm warning through Sunday evening, with 4-8 inches of snow possible. Additional snow will likely fall on Monday.

""Forecasting snowfall amounts in the nation's capital is rarely easy, but confidence is increasing that the DC area will see a significant snowfall developing on Sunday and lasting into Monday,"" says CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward.

The storm could bring the nation's capital as much as 10 inches of snow. This would end the 709-day streak that Washington, DC, has gone without a snowfall greater than 1 inch.

""The only other time this has happened was a 788-day streak that ended in 2013,"" said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller.

The storm's path

On Sunday morning, more than 110 million people were under winter weather alerts from the southern Great Lakes to New England. The storm left heavy snow across northern Illinois and central Indiana, causing travel headaches.

The storm will strengthen into a powerful nor'easter by Monday morning as it reaches the coast. This will be a long duration event for many along the eastern seaboard as the system will be slow to exit.

Snow will fall in periodic bursts over the next three days from DC, Philadelphia, New York City to Boston, ending gradually from the southwest to the northeast.

Here is the latest information on the multi-day winter storm from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. pic.twitter.com/9I039f6aAQ — NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) January 30, 2021

Major impacts expected

Strong winds will accompany the heavy snow, reducing visibility and causing power outages. Travel disruptions will be extensive from the ground to the air as the storm coats roads and runways with fresh snow.

Snowfall rates of 1-2 inches per hour were reported near Chicago's suburbs late Saturday evening, where up to 9 inches of snow is forecast by Sunday night.

As the storm moves east, it will reorganize and intensify. The highest snow accumulations will occur from New Jersey to southern New York, eastern Pennsylvania and parts of Maryland, where up to a foot of snow is possible.

Ice and sleet accumulation is also a concern for portions of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia. The highest totals will likely fall north of Charlotte and Raleigh where up to 1/2 inch of ice is possible.

The warm sector of this storm is creating numerous showers and embedded thunderstorms across the central and southeastern US today. Expect a rainy Sunday in Atlanta before showers exit the region by the start of the work week.

Areas farther west such as St. Louis and Springfield, Illinois, will see more of a rain/snow mix through Sunday evening. Exactly how much snow will stick to the ground remains uncertain.

One week after areas of Iowa were pummeled by snow, the Hawkeye State could see a few additional inches by Sunday night.

A developing nor'easter

JUST WATCHED What is a nor'easter? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is a nor'easter? 01:03

Snow is expected to be widespread by late Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service in Baltimore and Washington, DC. By Sunday afternoon into Monday, there is the potential of a changeover to sleet and freezing rain.

With any nor'easter, there is uncertainty in the forecast snow totals because so much depends on the exact track of the low pressure.

""There seems to be a consensus amongst forecast models that moderate to heavy snow will occur from portions of Virginia to Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but there continues to be some uncertainty on the exact track of the low pressure Monday into Tuesday,"" Ward said.

""This will have a significant impact on how much snow falls from New York City into New England. A storm system that tracks parallel to the coast would provide greater snowfall, while a more eastward track out to sea would limit snow totals in New England.""

That could make the difference in places like Boston and New York City between seeing 4 inches of snow or a foot.

Philadelphia's NWS office is forecasting more than 6 inches of snow with gusts of wind as high as 45 mph ""creating significant blowing and drifting snow.""

Biden climate envoy says working with China on climate needs to happen despite issues between countries,"Special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry said that the US and China need to work together to combat climate change, and that the work on that problem needs to happen despite various other issues between the two countries.

“Now, with respect to China, obviously we have serious differences with China on some very, very important issues,” former Secretary of State Kerry said, noting he is very familiar with those differences. “Those issues will never be traded for anything that has to do with climate.”

Kerry called climate a stand-alone issue that they have to deal on considering the US, China and the EU make up more than 50% of the emissions worldwide.

“So it's urgent that we find a way to compartmentalize, to move forward, and we'll wait and see but President Biden is very, very clear about the need to address the other issues with China. And I know some people have been concerned. Nothing is going to be siphoned off into one area from another,” Kerry added.

National climate advisor Gina McCarthy said that one of the issues the US faces with China is shifting to clean energy that manufactured in America, not other countries. McCarthy praised President Biden’s “Buy America” pledge as a good first step in addressing this to both combat climate change and also advance job growth in America.

"""Too early"" to share excess vaccines with EU and developing nations, UK trade secretary says","Ella Lamy, left, and Danielle Seal describe their daily struggles to avoid life-threatening infections. Courtesy Ella Lamy and Danielle Seal

Tentative optimism has emerged about an exit route from the pandemic as multiple forms of Covid-19 shots are rolled out across the UK and Europe.

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged that every British adult will be offered a Covid-19 vaccine by the autumn of 2021, following pressure to ramp up vaccination as cases in the country continue to rise, with more than 3.7 million infections reported to date.

But while most people will benefit from Covid-19 vaccines, those with impaired immune systems may not respond to them in the same way as their peers.

Danielle Seal likens going for a walk during the pandemic to an extreme sport.

""When I go [and walk] the dog I have to ask people to stay two meters away,"" she told CNN. ""And that's what really upsets me. If you try and squeeze past me, you are putting my life in danger. Going for a walk is an adrenaline-seeking extreme sport.""

Seal has Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder (CVID), a type of primary immune deficiency (PID). This means that her body does not produce protective antibodies to defend itself against pathogens like bacteria or viruses, leaving Seal and others like her extremely vulnerable to infections -- even without a global pandemic.

The 45-year-old has taken extreme care during the crisis to avoid contracting Covid-19, but her situation is unlikely to change in the long-term, even as governments fixate on the glimmer of hope provided by vaccines against the coronavirus.

""Many individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable will have some degree of immunosuppression or be immunocompromised and may not respond as well to the vaccine,"" reads the advice from Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI.)

This is because vaccines are designed to generate an immune response from the human body, by causing it to produce antibodies and T-cells that help fight specific infections. But for people with immune deficiencies, the body may just make a few of these antibodies or T-cells — or none at all — leaving them vulnerable to infection.

"For some volunteers helping with the Covid-19 vaccination effort, early vaccination is a bonus","(CNN) As the new administration works to expand the nation's pool of eligible Covid-19 vaccinators and health systems recruit community members who can lend a hand, some volunteers are receiving a coveted bonus for their time: a shot in the arm.

States have worked individually to temporarily license more people to give vaccines, but on Thursday the US Department of Health and Human Services amended the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. The change broadens the pool of eligible vaccinators across the US. As a result, retired doctors and nurses whose licenses expired in the last five years are now eligible to administer vaccines, and anyone certified to administer vaccines in one state can now also give them anywhere in the US.

The administration purchased 200 million additional vaccine doses this week and promised increased distribution to states. Volunteers will play a significant role in getting those doses administered. But for many, whether they can get vaccinated themselves depends on the jurisdiction they are in and how many doses happen to be available on any given day.

A break from retirement

Like many local health departments these days, St. Joseph County in South Bend, Indiana is seeking volunteers.

""We're a local health department of 50 staff that cover five different key areas of public health, so when we look at our immunization team, we're talking about less than a dozen people,"" said Robin Vida, the health department's volunteer coordinator.

The county put out a call for volunteers to help with the vaccination effort, and Vida said they soon had more than 1,500 responses.

One of those responses came from Dr. Robert Riley, a retired family physician.

""As somebody who's recently retired, I've spent an awful lot of time at home, so the opportunity to first of all get out and have some human contact was attractive, as well as finally feeling like I could do something,"" said Riley. ""This virus has been rampaging all over the world and hitting close to home as well as far away, and the opportunity to step in and actually make a difference was very appealing.""

During his first volunteer shift, Riley inquired about whether he could receive a vaccine, and was given a shot of the Moderna vaccine that day. He's due for his second shot in a couple of weeks.

Riley is 63, and was not providing direct patient care before volunteering, so he would not have otherwise received a vaccine. He said getting vaccinated a little early was just a nice bonus.

Vida said her team was planning to vaccinate all volunteers, but after learning about their modest vaccine allotment, they decided they could only commit to vaccinating those who volunteer 60 hours over the course of three months.

Many health systems and providers have had to come up with their own criteria for whether and when volunteers can get vaccinated.

Dr. Sarah Nafziger, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), said that all volunteers who work regularly in patient-facing roles at UAB's vaccination sites are offered the vaccine.

Many of UAB's volunteers are students, including those who help with paperwork, managing traffic flow and setting up the sites.

""Just because you're in an administrative role doesn't mean you're not patient-facing,"" she said. ""It's really about who interacts with the patients.""

Some providers have even advertised the vaccine as an incentive in their efforts to recruit volunteers, but others are reluctant to make promises while there is so much uncertainty around the supply of doses.

Vaccine not always a guarantee for volunteers

LaKieva Williams helps run Georgia Responds, the state's Covid-19 volunteer response effort. Volunteers sign up online and outline their skills -- from medical to administrative -- and are matched with organizations or health systems within the state that need their help.

Since March, Williams says more than 7,000 Georgians have signed up. Some of those people, like part-time health care workers, already qualify to receive a vaccine. Others, like the administrative assistants, computer analysts and engineers who have volunteered their skills, may have to wait a while.

The Georgia Department of Health said that as a statewide agency, it cannot guarantee all volunteers priority access to vaccines.

""While I think ideally, you want all of your volunteers to be vaccinated we still have to adhere to the phases in the rollout,"" Williams said. ""The intent is there, but it's a matter of supply.""

If vaccine allotment increases, Vida said St. Joseph County hopes to be able to stand up additional satellite vaccination clinics in communities that have a harder time accessing the main clinic.

""In all honesty, if we had unlimited amount of vaccine, we would probably triple the amount of people we would see in a day,"" she said. ""If we can build a really solid group of healthcare and community members, we'll be able to host those satellite clinics without any issues.""

Riley said there's no shortage of community members willing to help. He's even helping to train a few.

""I worked yesterday with two retired physicians that I've known for decades,"" he said. ""We have flexibility, and we have the ability to do something that not everybody can do.""

He said that sometimes volunteers are offered remaining doses at the end of the day.

""You can't save those extra doses until tomorrow, you've got to try and get them into people, and they're trying to use that as the funnel for getting the volunteers caught up,"" said Riley.

He said the clinic is vaccinating about a few hundred people a day, but he believes they have the space and manpower to do far more.

""The people that have the qualifications to help have been willing to do so,"" said Riley. ""We just need more vaccine."""
First on CNN: Trump's impeachment defense team leaves less than two weeks before trial,"(CNN) Former President Donald Trump's five impeachment defense attorneys have left a little more than a week before his trial is set to begin, according to people familiar with the case, amid a disagreement over his legal strategy.

It was a dramatic development in the second impeachment trial for Trump, who has struggled to find lawyers willing to take his case. And now, with legal briefs due next week and a trial set to begin only days later, Trump is clinging to his election fraud charade and suddenly finds himself without legal representation.

Butch Bowers and Deborah Barbier , who were expected to be two of the lead attorneys, are no longer on the team. A source familiar with the changes said it was a mutual decision for both to leave the legal team. As the lead attorney, Bowers assembled the team.

Josh Howard, a North Carolina attorney who was recently added to the team, has also left, according to another source familiar with the changes. Johnny Gasser and Greg Harris, from South Carolina, are no longer involved with the case, either.

No other attorneys have announced they are working on Trump's impeachment defense.

Residents of Washington town wonder if QAnon has taken hold of their mayor,"Sequim, Washington (CNN) The 7,000 residents of Sequim, Washington, nestled in a valley on the Olympic peninsula two hours west of Seattle, are grappling with a big question: Has the QAnon conspiracy taken hold of their mayor?

""Why do you publicly support QAnon,"" two callers asked this week during the mayor's monthly ""Coffee with the Mayor"" community access radio broadcast.

""What does the Punisher symbol mean to you?"" asked another caller, referring to the comic book antihero icon that has been adopted by QAnon followers. ""Are you concerned that the publicity received as a result of your stance on QAnon will hurt our reputation?""

Mayor William Armacost answered each question on his radio program calmly, patiently and with scant apology about his growing internet attention as a mayor who called the conspiracy theory a ""truth movement.""

""I have never publicly stated I support it,"" Armacost said, referring to QAnon. ""I'm an information seeker. I should have kept my personal feelings to myself. I'm here to talk about our beautiful little town of Sequim.""

But a sizable number Sequim residents have organized a petition to reinstate the city manager, who resigned earlier this month. They call the mayor a dangerous threat after a number of suspected QAnon followers were arrested for their alleged roles in the Jan. 6 US Capitol insurrection.

""The people that led the Capitol insurrection were Q leaders,"" said Shenna Younger, a Sequim resident leading Sequim Good Governance League, a grassroots movement that hopes to unseat the mayor. ""This isn't just a conspiracy theory. This is serious.""

'QAnon is a truth movement'

Sequim's city council centers around a salaried city manager that serves as chief executive. That means Armacost doesn't have the power allotted to most US mayors.

Most Sequim residents barely paid attention to Armacost until last August, when he broadcast a stunning statement during ""Coffee with the Mayor.""

Asked about QAnon, the mayor replied, ""QAnon is a truth movement that encourages you to think for yourself. If you remove Q from that equation, it's patriots from all over the world fighting for humanity, truth, freedom and saving children and others from human trafficking.""

Armacost then encouraged his listeners to watch a QAnon video filled with the conspiracy theories about a cabal of Satan-worshiping, child sex-trafficking group formed as part of a ""deep state"" seeking to annihilate Donald Trump.

The video echoes the unfounded claims promoted by QAnon. Since its origin, QAnon moved from the darkest corners of the internet as a single conspiracy theory to baseless theories about elections, global financial systems and human trafficking.

Shortly after Armacost's comments about QAnon, the city manager, Charlie Bush, issued a press release with Armacost. Bush highlighted that the ""Coffee with the Mayor"" forum is designed to discuss issues specific to Sequim. And he noted how irregular the national comments were for the mayor. In that same release, the mayor called his decision to respond to a QAnon question ""inappropriate.""

Earlier this month, the city council approved Bush's sudden resignation after a surprise motion from Armacost. The resignation of the popular city manager alarmed Sequin residents who believe the public clash over QAnon led to Bush's departure.

Bush told CNN he would not comment on his departure.

On Thursday's ""Coffee with the Mayor"" broadcast, residents like Karen Hogan called in to demand an explanation.

""We have philosophical differences between the city council and the city manager,"" Armacost said.

""What are those differences?"" Hogan fired back on the call.

""I'm not at the liberty of revealing those,"" Armacost said. ""We have great differences, and we will leave it at that.""

Two callers into the mayor's broadcast then asked, ""Why do you publicly support QAnon?""

""I have never publicly stated I support it,"" Armacost said. ""I'm an information seeker and I should have kept my personal feelings to myself.""

Residents who formed the Sequim Good Governance League dispute the mayor's defense.

Armacost's opponents point to the mayor's personal Facebook page, where Armacost has shared multiple posts of disinformation and the phrase ""WWG1WGA,"" a rallying cry that QAnon supporters have adopted, meaning, ""Where we go one, we go all.""

They also say the mayor has been wearing a lapel pin at the virtual city council meetings this year. The pin, plainly visible on the recorded city council meetings, is a skull matching the Punisher symbol favored by QAnon believers. The mayor says the pin is in support of law enforcement.

Younger says 500 people have joined the Sequim Good Governance League in just two weeks. They fear that the departure of the city manager signals the mayor may further influence the town.

""People are awake now,"" Younger said. ""They want to participate, and they want to be involved.""

Rick Perdue, who recently moved to Sequim from the East Coast, said he was shocked to hear about the mayor of his new town, which he described as moderate and welcoming.

""I didn't think we'd have this kind of a nutcase here. He should represent the values of the community, not his crazy right wing QAnon conspiracy stuff,"" Perdue said.

Perdue points out that Sequim is in Clallam County, a bellwether county that has picked the winning President in every election since 1980. The county, says Perdue, represents the political sentiment of the country, which is why he is alarmed by the mayor's words.

""There's a lot of people that believe this,"" Perdue said. ""Look at the stuff that's going on in Congress now. We're certainly not unique in having high level people that follow the QAnon conspiracy theory information.""

'I even read the fake news'

On Thursday, CNN approached Armacost outside the radio station following his program. For 15 minutes, the mayor calmly and politely answered questions.

When quoted back what he previously said on his radio program, calling the conspiracy theory a ""truth movement,"" Armacost said, ""What I call is the opportunity as a patriot and as an American citizen to seek truth. That comes through analysis and research. People need to make up their own mind to make up their own homework.""

The mayor said he regretted telling residents to view the QAnon video, but he didn't acknowledge the video's outlandish content. Without prompting, the mayor then diverted the conversation to human trafficking. One of the promoted QAnon conspiracy theories is that the members of ""deep state"" engage in trafficking.

""I think if you take the time to do the research, there are many parallels that you may read that have been historically in the books of things that have happened,"" Armacost said. ""The human trafficking is one of them. We've had a great opportunity to seek more people that are in peril and rescue them and try to recover a normal life.""

When asked whether he's a QAnon follower, the mayor said, ""I entertain all resources. I even read the fake news, to even see if there's a fabric, a thread of fabric that contains truth.""

Armacost says he could never support defacing a building like the US Capitol or attempting to harm or disrupt a public official. But he questioned whether QAnon beliefs fueled some of the Capitol insurrectionists, despite video showing Jan 6 rioters wearing Q shirts and carrying Q signs as they breached the Capitol.

""I've watched a lot of videos of what appears to be scenarios versus what has continued to run. I have no way to confirm that that was one group versus another,"" Armacost said. ""Just because the angle of the camera showed this view, it may not have shown another angle that shows a totally different scenario. I'm not denouncing it, but I'm not committing that this frame that I saw on a clip is the truth versus they didn't show all the information.""

Ultimately, the mayor says what he believes privately carries no impact on his non-partisan job as mayor of Sequim.

On whether he would denounce QAnon as concerned Sequim residents have asked him to do, the mayor said, ""I'm not supporting it. I'm not in a position...I'm one small man that runs a small business in a small little town. I don't have the authority to denounce or promote either.""

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Sequim residents have organized a petition to oust Mayor William Armacost. They have organized a petition to reinstate the city manager."
Why parents should brace themselves for another uncertain summer and fall,"(CNN) I remember the talk among parents on my son's last day of in-person school since the pandemic began. Back in March, some of them didn't believe it might be three whole weeks until our kids could return to school here in Oakland, California.

Then there were those parents, sadists I was certain, whispering about how it might last until the end of the school year.

Nobody knew back then when schools would reopen, and here's a truth I don't want to admit -- nobody knows now.

Like so many parents, I am desperate for some clarity. I want to hope. I also want to plan.

Should we budget for extra child care again next year if there is no in-person school? Or should we find ways to cut back at work? Should we sign up for summer camps? Then, the hardest part, what do we say to our children when they look us in the eye and ask when-oh-when can they have birthday parties and soccer games and sleepovers and the incalculable other rites of passage they are being denied? How much longer do we have to say no?

Parents, caregivers, kids: We just don't know.

High case rates, new variants, teacher union negotiations, and elaborate and costly protocols for safe school reopenings all complicate a return to our kids' pre-pandemic life.

Experts agree that a widely available pediatric vaccine would simplify the process, but we don't know when we can expect it and whether it's necessary for a safe return.

The state of the research on kids

A student walks the halls between classes on January 25, the first day of in-person learning at Arvada West High School in Colorado.

Now that Covid-19 vaccines are proven to be safe and effective in adults, drug companies have begun studying those same vaccines in children. Researchers are currently focused on teens and tweens with the intention of, over time, working their way to younger children as safety in older kids is proven in clinical trials.

""From an ethics standpoint, you don't want to start studying a medication with vulnerable populations like children and pregnant women until you have proven safety and efficacy in the adult population,"" explained Dr. Larry Kociolek, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and medical director of infection prevention and control at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

Children older than 16 were included in adult trials, and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is now approved for ages 16 and older. (The Moderna vaccine is approved for adults ages 18 and older.) Their vaccinations are a matter of vaccine availability -- which is yet another point of uncertainty.

Children ages 12 to 17 are currently being studied, though the time lines as to when those results might come out remain unclear. Children under 12 have yet to be studied, but things are progressing quickly.

""No US studies that have opened go down into those age ranges, and the exact time line for starting studies on younger children is not available,"" said Dr. Evan Anderson, professor of pediatrics at Emory University and a physician at Children's Healthcare in Atlanta.

Older teens might get vaccinated for fall

If you have a 16-year-old at home, there is a decent chance they will get vaccinated in time for the new school year this fall, experts say. But it's increasingly doubtful whether the vaccination -- and the second follow-up shot -- will happen in time for summer camp.

Those 12 and up are next in line, and have a good chance of seeing a vaccine in time for next school year, which would make it more likely for them to return to school.

Have kids 12 and under? Don't count on a vaccine in time for the fall.

""It's possible that that age group will be eligible as early as late summer or early fall, but that may be optimistic. But even if they are, it will take several months or longer to broadly distribute the vaccine,"" Kociolek said.

Preschoolers will take even longer to get vaccinated, likely not until 2022. Nonetheless, many preschools have managed to safely stay open during the pandemic.

Anderson believes it's still possible to get a vaccine to elementary school kids in time for next school year, ""but that window is rapidly closing.""

Herd immunity and school reopenings

Fine. No holding our breath for vaccines for those 12 and under in time for next school year. But what impact does this have on this age group possibly going back to school next year?

There is increasing evidence that schools can be opened safely for everyone , if they have the ability to follow the recommended protocols. As we've all learned, that's a big ""if,"" one that leaves us with, yes, more uncertainty.

Widespread vaccination and herd immunity would remove much of the risk, even if schools can't follow these protocols. Is vaccinating adults enough to achieve immunity and minimize risks? Or is it unsafe until kids are vaccinated as well?

On this, the experts are split.

A widely distributed pediatric vaccine should be a priority, Anderson believes.

""In order for us to completely move out of pandemic mode, we need to ensure that our children are able to, and do, receive a vaccine,"" he explained. ""Otherwise you have a continuous reservoir of children who are susceptible to Covid-19. We are likely to see sustained transmission among young children and the virus leaping from this group to other unvaccinated populations or individuals.""

He worries that children could give it to immunocompromised adults who might not respond to the vaccine. He also worries about children falling ill themselves; while Covid-19 is far less dangerous for kids, it is not risk-free. The number of children who died from Covid-19 this past year was akin to a particularly fatal flu season. ""We vaccinate them for the flu,"" he said.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held a meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on January 27. Dr. Emily Erbelding, director of the division of microbiology and infectious diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that the ""pediatric burden of disease is significant,"" that there is a ""disproportionate burden among children in minority communities,"" and there will be a ""continued burden if we wait for natural 'herd' effects.""

Will vaccinated adults reduce children's risk?

Other experts want to emphasize that the likelihood of children getting Covid-19 will go down considerably when adults are vaccinated.

""In regards to Covid-19 in children, the highest risk of exposure for children is coming from those who care for them in their homes,"" Kociolek explained. ""We know if we vaccinate parents against pertussis (whooping cough), for example, it can prevent it in infants. We call it cocooning, and it's a way to protect children by creating a web of immunity.""

If you take into account all the people who have already contracted the coronavirus and combine that factor with those who are likely to get the vaccine in the next six months, it seems likely that we will achieve herd immunity without a pediatric vaccine, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

""You probably don't need to vaccinate children to stop the spread,"" he said.

For now, educators aren't sure. Some are already calling for the vaccination of teachers and students before they will return to work. Many others are waiting to follow the lead of scientists and public health officials.

Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said it's possible that a safe reopening for all could involve a vaccine for kids, ""but we don't have the science on that yet. I'm a science teacher, and so I know we have to listen to the professionals on that. We're not making any statement yet.""

Living with uncertainty

""What I am telling you (in late January) may not be accurate very soon considering how fast this is moving,"" Kociolek said. That's a sentiment echoed by many of his medical colleagues. There are so many unknowns, so many variables, and they're all subject to change. Which leads us back to more uncertainty.

There is a certain relief in accepting the uncertainty and putting an end to speculating. It reminds us to make only plans that can easily be broken, and to avoid counting on anything that will break our kids' hearts should it have to be canceled.

It also pushes us to envision what another potentially 12 months of having elementary school kids at home looks like, and what, if anything, you might be able to do to make it work better for your family. This might include realizing the limits of DIY-ing our way through the pandemic and fighting for more structural support; a Marshall Plan for Moms, perhaps?

I hesitate to suggest that this is an opportunity to teach kids about uncertainty, as I am not sure our kids need any more lessons from this furshlugginer (Yiddish for ""piece of junk"") pandemic, as my firstborn now refers to it. At this point, the kids are probably all lessoned out.

Kids do appreciate honesty, though. Tell older kids that you don't know if they are going back to school this spring. If they are younger, tell them you don't know if they are going to camp or back to school next fall.

Tell them a lot of good, hard-working people are doing what they can to make this happen as soon as possible. Will they succeed? Eventually, yes. We just don't know when."
A 10-year-old investor made big bucks on the GameStop shares he got for Kwanzaa,"(CNN) Jaydyn Carr was a GameStop shareholder long before the buying frenzy that sent share prices skyrocketing, and now the 10-year-old investor has cashed in, making almost $3,200.

Jaydyn Carr wants to buy Microsoft stock with some of his earnings.

His mother, Nina Carr, told CNN that she bought Jaydyn 10 shares of the company's stock in 2019 as a Kwanzaa present, because she wanted to teach him about investing.

The San Antonio fifth grader loves video games, so the stock was a natural choice.

""We were always there two years ago, just buying different video games,"" she said. ""I was like, 'I can give him the shares the GameStop and give him something tangible to hold on to and that way he can appreciate it that way.'""

She bought the shares for about $60 and printed out a stock certificate, which she framed and gift wrapped. He'd been wanting an XBox One but said he liked the gift."
Here's what really happens to the items you return online,"You open up the box.

For whatever reason, you don't like it.

So, you send it back... for free . No questions asked. The retailer pays for the shipping costs and already is losing money. Immediately the hourglass of profit turns. Each grain of sand, a few cents dropping from the original price of that air fryer.

The warehouse of 888 Lots is a dizzying maze of categorized boxes called ""lots"". Resellers buy these lots which contain an assortment of returned products.

Once your return arrives at its destination, an employee needs to open the air fryer, inspect it, maybe even plug it in to test all of its features to ensure it's not broken. This costs the retailer time and money. Not to mention, the box was opened, so putting this back on the shelf with other brand-new air fryers is out of the question.

In short, receiving and handling a return isn't simple in the slightest. And for a number of items, big retailers like Walmart, Target and Amazon don't want to bother.

That's where Albert Palacci comes in.

A tsunami of returns

Despite conventional thinking, returns often don't end up back on the shelf, according to Palacci, CEO of 888 Lots, a liquidation company based in New Jersey. ""Customers really believe that the product just goes into the black hole or ends up being resold to another customer as brand new. And in many instances, that's not the case.""

As it turns out, returned products -- even in brand new condition -- can end up in liquidation warehouses, like Palacci's.

And this year, he just might get a record number. As the pandemic shuttered doors and shoppers increasingly turned to online retailers, the promise of free returns has now led to what experts predict will be a ""tsunami"" of returned items for retailers to deal with.

An employee sorts through a pile of returns and categorizes each item to eventually be sold to a reseller.

Following 2020's holiday shopping season, real estate firm CBRE estimates that more than $70 billion worth of online purchases will be returned -- a 73% increase from the previous five-year average.

To be sure, Amazon, Target, and Walmart resell a portion of returned products themselves. Amazon, for instance, operates Amazon Warehouse -- a marketplace for used and refurbished products. Similarly, Walmart lists refurbished electronics on its website and resells returned products in its stores' clearance section.

But sometimes the math just doesn't add up for that to make sense. That's good for Palacci's business.

The land of the misfit toys

Palacci strolls through his warehouse with an ease and comfort of a seasoned veteran excited by the organized chaos that echoes through rows-upon-rows of barcode-labeled boxes. Many of the boxes bare the familiar Amazon Prime swoosh, but this is no Amazon-owned warehouse.

If there is really a land of the misfit toys, this is it.

888 Lots buys up returned products from retailers at a discounted price. From there, there's still lots of work to be done.

Boxes -- roughly eight-feet tall with the volume of a small closet -- are dumped into a large pile. Employees sift through, sorting products by category as they go -- children's toys, Halloween costumes, men's socks, board games, personal care products, office and garden supplies, kitchen appliances, and electronics among others.

A large stack of Amazon Echo Dot devices and Fire Tablets fill a nearby pallet ready to be bought and resold.

Palacci sells to over 10,000 resellers. They range from small operations energized by the entrepreneurial spirit to more familiar names like Macy's Backstage and the Outlets at Bloomingdales.

One of many large boxes of returned products that fill the warehouse. The returned products in this box will eventually be sorted and categorized.

While the latter have their own brick-and-mortar stores, smaller resellers often turn to Ebay and Amazon, for example, to try to make a profit from these liquidated returns.

Palacci says his company has seen an uptick in business thanks to the surge in returns consumers are making. It's an often times symbiotic relationship that liquidators share with big-named online retailers.

Plus, there's an added upside: when products end up with 888 Lots and other liquidators, they at least avoid going straight to the landfill.

""Easily, 25% of all these returns get destroyed,"" said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis and founder of RetailGeek.com, a retail industry blog. ""And destroyed in the best case means recycled, but often means ending up in a landfill or literally burned.""

As troublesome as the problem currently is, Goldberg sees a silver lining in 2020's record-breaking year for e-commerce.

""There's a happy outcome where less of this stuff ends up in a landfill just because there's more money to be made by keeping it out of the landfill.""

As he gazes down a long aisle of easily hundreds, if not thousands, of returned items, Palacci muses, ""Products ending up in landfills...customers don't really even think of that as part of the purchase process."""
Five men arrested after asylum center set ablaze in UK,"London (CNN) Five men have been arrested in connection with a fire ""believed to have been started deliberately"" at a UK asylum facility on Friday.

The fire broke out on Friday at the Napier Barracks, a decommissioned military complex that now houses asylum-seekers and has been at the center of a recent row between Home Secretary Priti Patel and refugee charities who have called on her to close the facility.

Napier barracks suffered a fire believed to have been started deliberately.

Charities have claimed that the estimated 400 asylum-seekers at the facility have been living in poor conditions in overcrowded dormitories and that a recent Covid-19 outbreak has infected at least 120 people, PA Media reported.

Kent police Saturday said enquiries into the incident were continuing and that ""no serious injuries were reported as a result of the incident, however a significant amount of damage was caused to one part of the site following a fire -- which is believed to have been started deliberately.""

On Friday, the home secretary took to Twitter to condemn the ""shocking scenes"" from Napier Barracks where the Home Office said windows were smashed and a building set on fire.

What's new in fast food: Chicken sandwiches and cauliflower rice,"New York (CNN Business) If you felt like a new fried chicken sandwich debuted every day in January, you're not far off.

Some chains tried their best to slim down, while others did the exact opposite. The flurry of chicken sandwich additions are notable because several chains have eliminated a number of items over the past year to shed complexity and costs.

However, with a new year kicking off and sales on the rise once again, restaurants are doing all they can to sustain the growth after a bleak 2020

Here's what's making their nationwide debuts on menus everywhere:

Boston Market

Boston Market enters the chicken sandwich wars with its own version.

As if there weren't enough options for a basic fried chicken sandwich, Boston Market is here to up the ante.

The Nashville Hot Crispy Chicken Sandwich is now being sold for a limited time, with a confident company saying that the ""chicken sandwich wars are over."" It gets its spiciness from a hot sauce that ""perfectly blends cayenne pepper and chili powder with sugar, garlic and a handful of secret spices.""

Chick-fil-A

Chick-fil-A's new grilled chicken sandwich.

The creator of the fried chicken sandwich is changing things up with a grilled version. The Grilled Spicy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich is its first new chicken sandwich in nearly two years and has its own specially created Cilantro Lime Sauce.

""We know guests are looking to add more variety to their meals, especially after a year where new food experiences were limited,"" said Leslie Neslage, director of menu and packaging at Chick-fil-A, in an acknowledgment that last year's start of the pandemic complicated menu debuts.

Chipotle

Chipotle's cauliflower rice made its nationwide debut.

Chipotle CMG added cauliflower rice to its menu as customers' tastes keep shifting toward healthier options, including low-carb or more plant-based alternatives. The rice alternative, which costs $2 extra, was tested last summer before making its nationwide debut earlier this month.

Starbucks

Starbucks' new Honey Almondmilk Cold Brew drink.

Starbucks SBUX Despite the frigid temperatures, cold drinks continue to be a success for the coffee chain.said sales of the icy concoctions have grown 45% over the past four years, which has prompted it to unveil another cold drink.

This month, the Honey Almondmilk Cold Brew, was added to menus -- a new drink that also capitalizes on the growth of non-dairy milks.

Pizza Hut

Pizza Hut's new Detroit-style pizza is now available.

Competition among big chains has been fierce during the pandemic, which has fueled a surge in pizza demand from Americans who are spending more time at home and avoiding dine-in restaurants. Pizza Hut hopes the new menu items sustain last year's growth, a trend that's likely to continue.

""What we saw in 2020 was that many of these pizza delivery guys had a big boom in their sales because there was nowhere else to go,"" Peter Saleh, a restaurant analyst with research firm BTIG, previously told CNN Business. He predicts pizza sales will remain healthy in 2021 as the ""environment for dining continues to be challenged."""
Trump's in a historically strong 2024 primary position for an ex-president,"(CNN) Donald Trump is no longer president. He no longer has the megaphone of Twitter.

But make no mistake: This is still Trump's Republican Party.

You see it in the actions of Republican state and local parties trying to punish those who went against Trump. You see this in a majority of congressional Republicans voting to uphold an objection to Pennsylvania's electoral votes for President Joe Biden

And more than that, you see it in the polling, which indicates that Trump's in a historically strong primary position for an ex-president. Indeed, he's polling tremendously well among Republicans in the context for any future presidential nominee.

Republican leaders go against Trump at their potential electoral peril. It's not that other Republicans can't beat Trump. We'll have to wait and see on that. Rather, it's that he could be a very big voice over the next four years.

After the US Capitol insurrection on January 6 , Trump's still cruising in a potential 2024 primary. A majority of Republicans (57%) said in an Ipsos KnowledgePanel poll that he should be the 2024 nominee.

Against named opponents, Trump easily leads the field. Among those who either voted for Trump in 2020 or are Republicans, Trump's averaging about half the primary vote. No one else is even close.

Trump pulling in half the vote may seem low given that Trump won over 90% of the vote in the 2020 primaries

His position, though, is extremely unusual for a president who just lost a general election. As I've noted previously, ex-presidents usually don't lead future primary fields. Most party voters are happy to see their presidents glide into the sunset.

The three presidents who lost their chance at another term in the polling era (Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992) were all lagging behind in early primary polling following their loss. Ford was in second place, Carter was in third place and Bush was in fourth place. None of them commanded anywhere near half the primary vote.

How well Trump is doing puts extreme pressure on Republicans within the party to adhere to any of the ex-president's doctrine. These members of Congress and other elected (and unelected) officials know that Trump is by far the most powerful politician within the party among the base.

To challenge Trump is to invite a primary challenge among an electorate where many voters still love him.

But let's expand our historical dataset. Let's go back to the 1980 primary season and look at all primaries that didn't involve a sitting president.

The average leader in the earliest polling was pulling in about one-third of the vote. Trump is well above that.

The only two candidates who were pulling in more than 50% (i.e. above Trump) at this point were Hillary Clinton for 2016 and Al Gore for 2000. Their leads ended up being large enough that few intraparty challengers emerged, and both had clear primary wins.

Indeed, while it is still extraordinarily early to even be thinking about the 2024 primary, it would be silly to dismiss the magnitude of Trump being in the position he is in.

In the 15 primaries without an incumbent since 1980, the candidate who led among those who actually ran won nine times (or in 60% of all examples). Given that most primary fields have loads of candidates running, a lead even at this early juncture is important even if it isn't determinative.

The only candidate who was polling remotely close to where Trump is, ran and lost a primary was Clinton in 2008. She had about a third of the early primary vote.

The average leader at this point who ran and lost had about 20% to 25%, depending on which polling you look at. Trump's doubling up on that right now.

It probably shouldn't be surprising that Trump is polling so well right now. While losing a general election may severely hurt the primary prospects of most presidents or those who have previously won their party's nomination, losing can't hurt you too much if voters think you were robbed.

Trump and many of his supporters falsely claimed without a shred of evidence that fraud was the reason he lost. That challenge went through the courts and even to Congress. Of course, Biden's win was legitimate.

Monmouth University poll conducted after Trump left the White House found, however, that 72% of Republicans said Biden only won because of fraud. That high of a percentage is unprecedented.

It likely helps Trump to continue to claim the winner he always says he is. And right now, Republicans seem more than willing to continue to see him that way as well."
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene boasts of 'great' conversation with Trump amid calls for her ouster,"(CNN) Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced Saturday she had spoken with former President Donald Trump amid calls for her expulsion from Congress, saying she'll ""never apologize"" as she faces backlash over controversial actions and recently resurfaced comments .

In a series of tweets, the Georgia Republican said she was ""so grateful for (Trump's) support and more importantly the people of this country are absolutely 100% loyal to him because he is 100% loyal to the people and America First.""

CNN has reached out to the former President for comment.

Greene's apparent conversation with Trump comes at a tumultuous time for the Republican Party , as GOP leaders navigate party infighting over the former President's role in inciting the deadly US Capitol riot that led to his second impeachment and how his legacy fits with the party's future.

Greene, in one of her tweets Saturday, declared: ""I won't back down. I'll never apologize. And I'll always keep fighting for the people.""

She also referenced comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a news conference this week in which the Democratic leader said that ""the enemy is within the House of Representatives,"" referring to the rhetoric and behavior of some Republican members of Congress, including Greene.

""Yes there is an enemy within,"" Greene wrote. ""And that enemy is a poisonous rot of socialist policies and America last sell outs who are pompous hypocrites that believe they are untouchable elites.""

The congresswoman said she denounced the January 6 violent attack on the Capitol and accused Democrats of trying to ""lie and blame"" Republicans for the violence.

Greene had helped promote Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election had been riddled with fraud and stolen from him, and on January 6, she joined some of her Republicans colleagues in objecting to counting electoral votes.

House GOP leadership meeting canceled amid party turmoil

On Saturday, CNN learned that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had canceled a Tuesday House GOP leadership meeting in advance of a meeting scheduled for Wednesday with all House Republicans amid the dust up over Greene's controversial comments and views, McCarthy's renewed loyalty to Trump , and questions about GOP conference chair Liz Cheney and the nine other members of the Republican caucus who voted to impeach the former President.

McCarthy's spokesperson told CNN the leadership meeting, slated for Tuesday afternoon, was canceled because the Republican leader will be traveling back from an energy event in Houston. However, he offered no additional details for why it wasn't rescheduled.

A source familiar told CNN they believed one of the reasons McCarthy canceled the meeting is because he doesn't want to discuss Greene.

CNN previously reported that McCarthy plans to speak with the congresswoman next week about her past comments and posts.

The cancellation of the leadership meeting comes at a critical time for House Republicans.

This week, in the aftermath of the divisive fight to impeach Trump, McCarthy privately told his GOP colleagues to ""cut that crap out"" and stop attacking one another publicly -- and instead focus on Democrats.

McCarthy has previously said he supports Cheney, the number three Republican in leadership, but has also said he has ""concerns."" McCarthy has not publicly addressed Greene or Cheney since his visit with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida where the two discussed strategy for winning the House majority in next year's midterms, according to Trump's ""Save America"" Political Action Committee.

While many House Republicans have remained silent on Greene's recent inflammatory comments and spreading of conspiracy theories, she hasn't escaped criticism from all members of her party.

GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump critic, reacted to Greene's announcement of her call with the former President in a tweet of his own, saying that ""lies of a feather flock together: Marjorie Taylor Greene's nonsense and the 'big lie' of a stolen election."" Greene swiftly responded to the Utah Republican by accusing him of not caring about people's concerns.

Democrats demand Greene's removal

Adding to the growing tensions between the two parties in the aftermath of the deadly riot on Capitol Hill, fellow freshman Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, announced Friday she will be moving her office away from Greene's after a heated exchange with the GOP congresswoman earlier this month over mask wearing.

And at least 50 House Democrats have called for Greene to be removed from Congress, with others demanding she be censured or face punishment after a number of her inflammatory comments came to light.

Democratic Rep. Nikema Williams, another member of Georgia's congressional delegation, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday that it's time for Greene to be removed from Congress.

""We saw a direct attack on the United States Capitol because of the rhetoric and incitement of violence she continues to do,"" said Williams, who's a co-sponsor of a bill to censure Greene.

Still, expelling a member from Congress requires two-thirds of the chamber to vote to remove that person. Republicans control just under half the seats in the House, and GOP leadership has so far shown no steps toward reprimanding Greene for her comments or previous posts.

"Seek out mental health help if you feel overwhelmed during pandemic, psychiatrist says","Dr. Patrice Harris, a psychiatrist and former president of the American Medical Association, said that parents should seek out mental health services if they feel like they are ""about to burn out"" as the coronavirus pandemic drags on.

“There is no shame in asking for help when you think you are at your wits’ end,” Harris told CNN. “The longer it goes, we are getting fatigued, and parents have had to work and continue to be parents and take care of a lot of other responsibilities. And we know that this pandemic has disproportionately impacted women.""

She added that if parents notice their children’s mental or physical health being affected by the pandemic, they should consult their pediatrician and look for resources from places like the American Psychological Association.

Harris also said that there is no “one-size-fits-all approach” to reopening schools.

She encouraged parents to seek out information on school reopening plans, any surveillance testing, and ask their children are ready to return to school."
"Massachusetts Democratic congressman, vaccinated for Covid-19, tests positive for virus","(CNN) Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, who has been vaccinated for Covid-19, tested positive for the virus on Friday afternoon and remains asymptomatic, according to his spokeswoman.

""This afternoon U.S. Representative Stephen F. Lynch received a positive test result for COVID-19 after a staff member in the Congressman's Boston office had tested positive earlier in the week,"" Lynch's spokeswoman Molly Rose Tarpey said in a statement Friday.

The Massachusetts Democrat plans to isolate and will vote by proxy in Congress over the coming week, according to Tarpey.

The congressman had received a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and had tested negative for Covid-19 before attending President Joe Biden 's inauguration on January 20, Tarpey said. But she did not specify when Lynch received each dose of the vaccine.

Covid-19 vaccines prevent illness, but do not necessarily prevent infection. If someone tests positive and doesn't get sick, the vaccine has worked as intended. If someone tests positive within a few weeks of receiving the second dose, it may be because the vaccine hasn't yet fully kicked in.

Russian activist Navalny's foundation calls on Biden to sanction Putin's closest allies,"Moscow (CNN) The foundation set up by Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has called on US President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on at least eight high profile Russian figures it says are close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) said it had submitted a broader list of 35 people in total in a letter addressed to Biden, dated Friday, with eight named on a ""priority shortlist."" The letter says seven of the 35 individuals are already on US sanctions lists.

The move comes ahead of nationwide protests planned this weekend in support of Navalny, who is being held in detention ahead of a court hearing next week.

In a copy of the letter obtained by CNN, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is named on the ""priority shortlist,"" for what FBK describes as being a key enabler and an alleged beneficiary of ""Kremlin kleptocracy."" Abramovich is the owner of English Premier League soccer club Chelsea. A spokesperson for Abramovich said in an email statement to CNN that ""there is no basis for such claims which are entirely without foundation.""

From building the wall to bringing back coal: Some of Trump's more notable broken promises,"Washington (CNN) While Donald Trump's first campaign for president was all about change, his argument for re-election was based on the premise that he had delivered on his initial promises and would continue to do so. The campaign slogan ""Promises made, promises kept,"" became Trump's rallying cry.

To be sure, Trump delivered on a number of initial campaign promises . He cut regulations, lowered taxes, withdrew from the Trans Pacific Partnership, pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement and appointed hundreds of conservative justices. But in many cases, the reality behind the talking points and slogans fell short of what was actually promised.

Here's a look back at how some of the most notable promises Trump made during his campaigns and throughout his time in office stack up against reality.

The wall

Building a wall on the US border with Mexico (and getting Mexico to pay for it) was one of Trump's flagship promises from his first campaign, though the specific parameters of the wall evolved over time, from 1,000 miles to over 5 00 miles.

Throughout his presidency, Trump acted as if this was one accomplishment he had successfully crossed off the list, continuing to tout the hundreds of miles of wall his administration had built.

But the figures he threw out, as recently as in his recorded farewell video, were misleading and didn't live up to what he initially promised. As of January 8, 2021, 453 miles of border barriers were built under the Trump administration, just 47 of which were erected where no barriers had existed before.

Of the other 406 miles: 22 miles replaced previously existing dilapidated or outdated secondary barriers, 33 miles were new secondary barriers where there had previously been only primary barriers and 351 miles replaced previously existing primary barriers that the government considered dilapidated or outdated. While these replacement barriers are not insignificant, it's worth noting that Trump did not build a new wall.

Furthermore, during the campaign, Trump insisted that Americans would not pay for the wall or any new barriers his administration constructed. According to Trump, Mexico would pay for the wall, but both the former and current Mexican president have refused to do so (the former President was more explicit while the current President, who has been less critical of Trump and has just avoided the topic). In the end, the US government spent billions in federal funds on the wall. Since January 2017, approximately $15 billion has been allocated to construct both new and replacement structures for the border wall through a combination of Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense funding combined with the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, according to a January 2021 report from Customs and Border Protection.

Vaccines

President Donald Trump walks out after speaking at the Operation Warp Speed Vaccine Summit on December 8, 2020 in Washington, DC.

As the coronavirus pandemic dominated the final year of Trump's presidency, he made a series of promises regarding a vaccine.

Trump repeatedly stated the US would have a vaccine by the end of 2020. While experts were skeptical, the Trump administration's accelerated vaccine development initiative, Operation Warp Speed, did result in a vaccine approved for distribution before the end of the year. The Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization to Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine in mid-December and to Moderna's vaccine about a week later.

But while Trump exceeded expectations in terms of the vaccine production timeline, his administration struggled to fulfill his promises regarding vaccine distribution. In October, Trump promised 100 million doses of the vaccine delivered before the end of the year. Though Trump administration officials later reduced the goal to 20 million Americans vaccinated against coronavirus by the end of December 2020, neither promise was ultimately fulfilled. Several states have blamed the federal government for the failure to meet the vaccination goals, complaining that the Trump administration initially provided fewer doses than previously promised . And with no federal mandate for how to administer the vaccines, eligibility for receiving the vaccine varied from state to state, likely causing an uneven distribution. As of December 31, 2020, fewer than 13 million vaccines had been distributed.

Pre-existing conditions

In countless rallies and other speeches, Trump claimed he and his administration would always protect people with pre-existing conditions.

This is one promise CNN was able to fact check even before the end of Trump's presidency, as the Trump administration and Republicans repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump also never issued a plan to protect those with pre-existing conditions, despite repeatedly promising to do so.

Obamacare

Protesters hold signs and shout at lawmakers walking out of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on May 4, 2017, after the House of Representatives narrowly passed a Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.

During his first campaign, Trump promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, a health care law often referred to as Obamacare. After the passage of the 2017 Republican tax bill which addressed a provision of the law, Trump began to claim victory. But despite his insistence to the contrary, Obamacare did not end under Trump's administration, essentially or otherwise.

In the 2017 tax bill , Republicans effectively eliminated the individual mandate, a key part of Obamacare, by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to $0. But other provisions of the law remained. The bill did not eliminate Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases. While Trump continued to take other steps to weaken Obamacare, much of it still exists.

Debt

Trump initially pledged to eliminate the US debt in eight years. He later scaled down the promise to just reducing a portion of the then-$19 trillion dollar debt. Though he didn't specify the extent of the new goal, under Trump the debt and deficit only got worse. According to the latest report from the Government Accountability Office, the federal debt was at $26.9 trillion as of September 30, 2020. The GAO attributed the increase between 2019 and 2020 to the federal government's Covid-19 pandemic response, but the national debt was rising even before the pandemic. By the end of 2019, the federal debt was at $22.7 trillion , more than three trillion more than right before Trump took office.

Manufacturing

President Donald Trump speaks to workers at a Whirlpool manufacturing facility on August 6, 2020, in Clyde, Ohio.

One of Trump's flagship campaign promises was to revive US manufacturing and in his final State of the Union address, he claimed to have succeeded in ""restoring our Nation's manufacturing.""

Manufacturing employment did increase during the first three years of Trump's presidency, but ultimately, any gains were gone by the end of his presidency, leaving the status of US manufacturing no better than when he took office. Between January 2017 and the end of 2020, there was a net decrease in manufacturing employment. While some of the decrease could likely be attributed to the pandemic, America's manufacturing sector was in a downturn even before that, as CNN reported in August 2019 that the sector shrunk for the first time since September 2009.

4% GDP growth

During his first presidential campaign, Trump set a goal of ""4% economic growth"" nationally, despite skepticism from economists. While Trump heavily leaned on his economic accomplishments throughout his time in office, annual GDP growth since 2017 never reached 4%, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The quarterly GDP growth rate did hit 4% once, in the 4th quarter of 2020 , though economists say that wasn't enough to make up for the year's historically awful second quarter. 2020 also marked the first year US GDP declined since 2009.

Average GDP growth did increase slightly under Trump, to 2.5% during his first three years. That's well below the 4% Trump had promised but a bit better than the 2.4% average growth rate during the last three years of Obama's time in office. But as of the 3rd quarter of his fourth year in office, the GDP growth under Trump was less than under the last five presidents before him at the same time in their presidencies, due in large part to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Trade deficits

As a candidate, Trump pledged to narrow America's trade deficit, especially with China. Although progress was made, Trump wasn't entirely successful. In 2019, the goods trade deficit with China fell to its lowest level since 2014. The overall US trade deficit also shrank in 2019, but it remained higher than when Trump took office. The gap was further exacerbated by the pandemic, with the trade deficit increasing nearly every month between April and August 2020. In November 2020, the trade deficit reached its highest level since 2006.

Coal

President Donald Trump holds up a ""Trump Digs Coal"" sign as he arrives to speak during a Make America Great Again Rally at Big Sandy Superstore Arena in Huntington, West Virginia, August 3, 2017.

At different times throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump said he was going to ""bring back"" coal and ""put the miners back to work.""

In 2016 , the US produced more than 728 million tons of coal, according to the annual report from the Energy Information Administration. While the Trump administration made some policy moves to try to help the coal industry, production levels have not increased under the Trump administration. The most recent available report indicates the US produced 706 million tons of coal in 2019, its lowest level since 1978, when there was a major strike.

According to a 2019 report from the International Energy Agency, the decrease in US coal production is in part the result of a shift toward cleaner renewables and cheaper natural gas. ""Cheap and abundant natural gas combined with the climate policies of many states will continue to squeeze coal out of the electricity market,"" the report claims

A November 2020 report from S&P Global Market Intelligence also shows a decrease in coal jobs since the start of the Trump administration. Furthermore, the 3rd quarter of 2020 marked a new low in average coal mine employment according to the S&P analysis.

Guns

At a 2016 campaign rally, Trump said , ""My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones."" He later doubled-down on the promise, telling the media he was going to do something to end gun free zones.

Not only did he not sign any legislation banning gun-free zones on his first day in office, but this was never accomplished. Though House Republicans proposed bills to repeal the Crime Control Act of 1990 which made it a crime to possess a gun within school grounds, these efforts were unsuccessful.

Lobbying

In 2016, Trump called for enacting a five-year ban ""on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for five years after they leave government service."" Within his first week, Trump signed the ""Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees"" executive order. While on the surface that may have seemed like a promise kept, the order contained a loophole. The order only required appointees to pledge that they will not ""engage in lobbying activities with respect"" to the executive agency they were appointed to serve, language which could theoretically have permitted officials to lobby on other issues not directly related to their role less than five years after they stopped working for the federal government. Additionally, days before his presidency came to an end, Trump revoked the rule, ostensibly allowing his former administration officials to begin lobbying when they left government if they so choose.

Leaving the White House

President Donald Trump golfs at Trump National Golf Club on November 21, 2020, in Sterling, Virginia.

In 2015, shortly after announcing his run for President, Trump said if elected he would ""rarely leave the White House because there's so much work to be done."" He also criticized Obama for ""all of the time [he] spent on the golf course, often flying to Hawaii in a big, fully loaded 747, to play.""

And yet, Trump left the White House repeatedly while he was president, often to spend time at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida or at his golf courses across the nation. In 2019 alone he spent 1 in 5 days at a golf club, per CNN's count

CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story oversimplified what Republicans did to the individual mandate in 2017. They effectively eliminated it by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to zero."
Biden's Supreme Court commission set to launch as some liberals are eager to pack the court,"Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden will soon reveal the membership and agenda of a commission that would take the first modern-day look at reforming the Supreme Court, according to officials familiar with the commission.

The move comes as liberals are calling for additional seats to balance out the conservative-dominated bench that is increasingly going to the right on abortion voting rights and religious freedom cases.

Biden first proposed a presidential commission as a candidate last October, partly as an alternative to immediate ""court packing"" demands from Democrats, as proposals for more seats on the nine-member bench are dubbed. Another idea that scholars have raised in recent years, and could be under consideration, is term limits for the justices, who currently enjoy life tenure.

Liberals pressing for dramatic change are trying to generate a sense of urgency by emphasizing just how different the high court is today. Trump appointments have accelerated the rightward tilt of judges across the county, and the Supreme Court is now controlled by the 6-3 conservative majority since the addition of Justice Amy Coney Barrett for the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg

Democrats remain incensed that Senate Republicans blocked the 2016 Supreme Court nomination of US Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland for nearly a year, but then moved swiftly to confirm President Donald Trump's appointees, including Barrett just days before the November 2020 presidential election.

""Democrats feel that seats were stolen from them, and that now their priorities will be struck down by the court,"" said University of Wisconsin law professor Joshua Braver, who has studied the history and consequences of ""court packing.""

Officials involved with the Biden commission say its membership and mission are being finalized and could be unveiled as early as next week.

The co-chairs will be Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel to President Barack Obama and currently a New York University law professor, and Cristina Rodriguez, a Yale law professor who early in her career was a law clerk to former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.

The full membership slate is not yet known, but it appears Biden, a Democrat, may fulfill his vow to appoint both Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives. Many members are law professors who have written on Supreme Court history, structure or reform.

Bauer and Rodriguez declined to comment.

Some of the commission's work would be conducted in public, under the usual rules for federal advisory panels, according to a person familiar with the set-up. Its report, with a six-month deadline, would likely be a starting point for executive-endorsed proposals, rather than a final recommendation for transforming the bench.

When Biden first revealed the commission plan, in a CBS interview last fall, he said he wanted ""recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it's getting out of whack.""

""It's not about court-packing,"" Biden said, responding to a question about the topic. ""There's a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated. ... The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want. Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations.""

Justices are resistant to change

Justices have historically bristled at loose proposals for the addition of seats or term limits. Congress sets the number of seats on the court, and any modification to life-tenure could arguably require a constitutional amendment. Some term-limit proponents suggest that life-tenure would be lifted if a justice were not stripped of his or her appointment after, for example, 18 years, but rather limited in what cases he or she could hear.

The nine are known for their resistance to change. The court does not permit cameras in its courtroom and is not formally covered by a federal ethics code.

Bauer, who previously co-chaired a bipartisan commission on election administration, has argued for a deeper discussion of Supreme Court reform, including term limits, supermajority voting requirements and ethics codes.

He opposed adding more seats to the Supreme Court in a 2018 Atlantic magazine piece headlined, ""Don't Pack the Courts."" He said the move ""would sap the Supreme Court of its legitimacy.""

Several liberal advocacy groups have joined together to promote four court-related priorities: the addition of Supreme Court seats; expansion of lower courts; term limits on justices; and new ethics rules for the high court.

Polls have shown Democrats more inclined than Republicans to support enlarging the high court. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in early September, for example, found 46% of adults in favor of increasing the number of justices on the US Supreme Court, with 53% opposed. Among Democrats, 61% favored expansion vs. 34% of Republicans.

""Incrementalism isn't going to fly this time,"" Brett Edkins, political director of Stand Up America, said Friday. ""The scale of the problem is huge. The Democrats have a narrow window of opportunity to repair it.""

History of 'court packing'

With the result of the Georgia US Senate election earlier this month, both chambers of Congress are now controlled by Democrats. But the Democratic majority is slim, and there currently is no obvious appetite to add more seats to a bench whose numbers have not been changed since 1869.

In earlier American history, there was more variation in the number of seats on the court, from a low of five to a high of 10. Politics often drove action to expand or contract the number of seats, although Congress would cloak its proposals in neutral justifications, for example, tied to caseload, as University of Alabama law professor Tara Leigh Grove has written.

In a dramatic 1930s ""court packing"" attempt, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked Congress to add more justices to a bench that was invalidating his New Deal economic initiatives. FDR proposed a new justice for every sitting justice older than 70; six of the nine were then over 70. His plan failed.

Roosevelt was targeting older conservative justices. Today, conservative justices are the relatively young ones. Barrett is 49, Neil Gorsuch is 53, and Brett Kavanaugh, 55. They are the three youngest justices. Stephen Breyer is the eldest, 82. Chief Justice John Roberts is 66.

Braver, the University of Wisconsin professor, said that adding new seats carries significant dangers.

""Court packing is a nuclear option. It would continue the political escalation and add new dangers,"" he said. ""It's not hard to imagine people in the future thinking they can defy the court's rulings,"" because of shifts in the number of seats.

He said a drawn-out study process may give the commission and the court time to observe each other.

""It's kind of a sword of Damocles hanging over this court,"" Braver added on Friday. ""The commission may or may not be pushed to certain positions based on how aggressive the court's rulings are in the meantime."""
Confused about this GameStop saga? Here are the 5 things you need to know,"(CNN Business) There was a lot to unpack in the deluge of news this week about GameStop, the stock market, Reddit groups, trading apps and hedge funds. If it all seemed like too much, we can't blame you for tuning out.

While we don't know just how the so-called Reddit rebellion will change the future of investing, it's safe to say Wall Street will never be the same.

Here are five key things you need to know about Wall Street's wild week.

1. IT'S A DAVID VS GOLIATH STORY

At the heart of the GameStop saga is a struggle between two drastically different groups of investors: A band of amateur day traders versus a bunch of Wall Street pros known as short-sellers.

The Davids, in this case, are the mostly young day traders who congregate on the Reddit page WallStreetBets — aka the Reddit army, or the Reddit mob, depending on your point of view. ""They have seen the rich get extremely rich by taking advantage of cheap money, and they want to get their piece as well,"" said Richard Fisher , the former president of the Dallas Federal Reserve.

GameStop GME AMC AMC Macy's M Their mission has two main goals: Drive up stock prices to score profits for themselves, and at the same time, force the establishment investors to abandon bearish bets against struggling companies such asand several others.

The Goliaths are mostly hedge funds who are shorting those stocks — in other words, big-shot investors placing bets that those shares will crash. They are also the Wall Street elite upon whom millions of investors rely to make smart decisions to boost their portfolios. But working in an industry associated with the house-of-cards system that created the 2008 financial crisis, these giants are not exactly beloved. Posts on the WallStreetBets subreddit openly relish watching short-sellers lose billions of dollars.

2. HOW THE GAMESTOP RALLY STARTED

The WallStreetBets community, which now boasts some 5 million followers, has been around since 2012. Describing itself as if ""4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,"" the forum's giddy nihilism, inscrutable language and acerbic memes have fueled a war on a perceived corrupted mainstream.

The group noticed that GameStop, the struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer, was heavily shorted by hedge funds. (The consensus on Wall Street seemed to be that GameStop would soon go the way of Blockbuster.)

Reddit investors took a different view from the short-sellers, however, and began buying up shares of the company that they believed were undervalued.

3. WHY IT BLEW UP

Although it had been building for a while, the rally really took off on Monday, January 11, when GameStop announced three new directors would join its board, including Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen. Investors liked that Cohen brought digital experience to the table, something GameStop desperately needs, as video games go digital and malls continue their unrelenting slump into irrelevance.

GameStop's stock rose a little less than 13% that day. But this wasn't a normal, momentary stock surge. Two days later, it rose 57%. Then 27%...and so on. The Reddit crowd also drove huge jumps in AMC, BlackBerry, Macy's and other stocks that were heavily shorted.

As of Friday, GameStop's stock was up a jaw-dropping 1,587% since the beginning of January.

For perspective: One year ago, a single share cost about $4. It's now about $150.

The surge ultimately had little or nothing to do with GameStop's strength as a business. As investors following the Reddit group bought a ton of GameStop options, short-sellers were forced to buy shares to cover their losing bids — thus boosting the share price even further. This is what's known as a short squeeze.

Millions of people, including Elon Musk , chimed in.

It quickly became ""a populist uprising armed with no-fee brokerage accounts instead of pitchforks,"" as CNN's Christine Romans put it. And the only ones crying foul were the ""sophisticated"" Wall Street players.

""The irony is delicious,"" Romans writes. ""An online flash mob beats Wall Street insiders at their own game.""

4. THE ROBINHOOD BACKLASH

On Tuesday, GameStop was the most traded stock on the planet. Then Robinhood crashed the party.

Thursday morning, citing extreme volatility, the free trading app favored by millions of amateur investors suspended trading of the red-hot Reddit darlings. That left the WSB crowd with just two options: hold or sell. Meanwhile institutional investors, who don't need Robinhood to execute trades, were able to carry on.

GameStop shares lost more than 44% of their value on Thursday after surging nearly 40% at one point earlier in the day.

The backlash was swift. Those who'd been minting money on their GameStop stock positions were, to put it mildly, furious. The consensus on social media seemed to be that Robinhood, which built its brand on ""democratizing"" investing, appeared to be caving to pressure from powerful institutions on Wall Street.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the decision ""unacceptable."" One Reddit user swiftly filed a class-action lawsuit, claiming Robinhood rigged the market against its customers.

Robinhood relented Thursday night, saying it would resume ""limited"" buys on the stocks the next day. It also tapped $1 billion in cash from its private investors, signaling it was short on cash.

On Friday morning, the GameStop euphoria was back. The stock opened up roughly 100%.

5. THE BUBBLE WILL BURST...EVENTUALLY

There's an argument to be made that GameStop was undervalued, but hardly anyone believes that GameStop, BlackBerry, Macy's, AMC or any of the other companies that the Reddit crowd is promoting have the fundamentals to support such sky-high prices. At some point, reality will set in.

But that's the problem with bubbles — get out too early, and you lose at a chance to cash out on top. So GameStop keeps surging ... until it doesn't.

""Someone is going to get hurt,"" said Fisher, the former Dallas Fed president. ""As happens with crowd behavior, you end up having people come in at the end at a very high price and getting burned."""
Why JoJo Siwa's coming out is such a massively big deal,"(CNN) JoJo Siwa's coming out kicked off in a very 2021 way -- on TikTok . In a rainbow-bedazzled hoodie and matching hair bow, she lip synced to Lady Gaga's inclusive anthem, ""Born This Way.""

She didn't have to say she was out. Her fans -- all 54 million of them across TikTok, YouTube and Instagram -- heard her. (The 17-year-old later confirmed that yes, she had come out, in a follow-up video thanking her audience for their support.)

There's no precedent for what JoJo did -- no star of her caliber, at her age, whose audience is made up of mostly elementary schoolers, has come out so publicly. And JoJo, with her unflappable joy, is an example unlike any LGBTQ young people have had.

""JoJo's pride in her identity and her confidence in shrugging off negative responses indicates that her social media presence will foster a sense of supportive community for LGBTQ youth,"" said Traci Gillig, an assistant professor of communication at Washington State University who studies the impacts of LGBTQ+ representation on young people. ""She's one more voice -- and a big one -- communicating to young LGBTQ people that they are loved.""

Now, LGBTQ kids have one of the world's biggest child stars in their corner.

JoJo says she's the happiest she's ever been

For the uninitiated, Joelle Joanie Siwa is a ray of unrelenting, occasionally grating sunshine. She's rarely seen without her gravity-defying ponytail tied neatly with an oversized bow. She exudes innocent, inexhaustible positivity. She delivers affirmations to her young viewers in enthusiastic screams.

In 2021, JoJo is at the height of her powers. She's a pop star, published author and alumnus of the Abby Lee Dance Company. Her name is used to sell bedazzled unicorn clothing, pink pint-sized furniture, face masks and, of course, bows. She's made millions from her merchandise, tours and uber-popular social channels. She lives in a mansion adorned with images of her face and drives a BMW convertible that bears her smiling face on the hood.

Because JoJo's persona has been monetized (and because most of her audience is young children), she keeps fans at a distance. She invites cameras into her home, and while she's reliably giddy and entertaining, she's also playing a part.

Her coming out, though, was devoid of all pretense.

@itsjojosiwa Love is Universal🌈 I'm so happy right now. The love and support during this time of my life is UNREAL. Thank you❤️ ♬ original sound - JoJo Siwa

CNN reached out to JoJo's publicists for comment and hasn't heard back. But JoJo delivered a statement on her coming out on Instagram Live

Wearing a black Time 100 hoodie (a subtle flex; she was on the magazine's list of the world's most influential people last year) and an understated bow, her voice lowered to a register she rarely uses online. She seemed genuinely touched by the support she received.

Someone on Instagram Live asked her how she identified. She answered candidly -- she doesn't know.

""I wanna share everything with the world; I really do,"" she told her rapt audience. ""But I also want to keep things in my life private until they're ready to be public.""

Still, she's ""never, ever, ever been this happy before,"" she said, beaming.

Jojo Siwa is one of the most influential children's entertainers in the world. She's also one of the first famous people to come out, as a teen, at the height of her powers.

""I think coming out has this stigma around it, that it's a really, really, really scary thing,"" she said. ""It's not anymore. There's so many accepting and loving people out there. Of course people are gonna say it's not normal, but it's your normal.""

Coming out is still really, really, really scary for many LGBTQ kids. A Human Rights Campaign survey found as much -- just over half of 10,000 teen respondents said they were out to their families. The teens who had come out to their immediate families reported feeling happier than those who had not.

JoJo also has the advantage, of course, of being rich and popular online. She could lose a lot by coming out -- sponsorships, fans, some income -- but the non-famous kids who watch her videos stand to lose a lot more.

But seeing someone like JoJo, who at 17 has already conquered worlds, come out in a very public way is still meaningful, said Jill Gutowitz, a culture writer whose upcoming book, ""Canon,"" examines the impact of queer women in pop culture.

""Queer adults have only just started seeing themselves represented by highly visible celebrities in the past few years, but teens and children -- Siwa's audience -- still don't have many out, queer, highly visible pop culture figures to look to,"" Gutowitz told CNN in an email.

Now, they've got one of the most visible kids in the world as an example.

""I've heard many people say that coming out with such a massive platform is 'brave,' and in a way that's true, given our culture's history of burying or erasing queerness,"" she said. ""But I don't think JoJo Siwa came out because she was doing something 'brave' -- I think she came out because this is who she is, and it's important to her to share all of herself with her fans.""

In that way, JoJo's living the same values she extols in her messages to fans: She's being her truest self.

She's setting a new precedent

Gillig, an assistant professor of communication at Washington State University, said JoJo's coming out is unlike that of any other celebrity.

""JoJo is a rare example of a young person who has been in the media spotlight for years before coming out as LGBTQ while still an adolescent,"" Gilig said.

There are some fictional examples -- two characters on the Freeform show ""The Fosters"" came out -- and the inevitable comparisons to Ellen DeGeneres , who came out on a Time magazine cover and an episode of her sitcom in 1997, Gillig said. JoJo has an advantage that the comedian-turned-talk show host didn't, though.

Two years after Ellen came out, only half of Americans believed a gay relationship between two consenting adults should be legal, according to Gallup polling . That number stands at 72% now. Homophobia and efforts to limit legal protections afforded to gay Americans are still widespread in the US, though general support for same-sex relationships has increased.

There's less consensus, though, about children who come out. Kids who know they're LGBTQ when they're young aren't always believed by the adults in their lives, and their experiences are often discounted, said Lori Duron, an advocate for LGBTQ youth and the mother of a gay, nonbinary child.

People ask Duron's son how, at 13, he knows that he's gay and nonbinary. They say he's too young to know for certain how he identifies, said Duron, a member of PFLAG , an organization for parents and their LGBTQ children.

When asked how long she's known she's LGBTQ, JoJo said she's probably known her entire life.

""I always believed my person would be my person,"" she said on Instagram Live. ""If that person happened to be a boy, great! If that person happened to be a girl, great!""

Duron said she thinks JoJo's example may force parents to take their children seriously when they come out at a young age.

JoJo, twinning with a doll.

""For her coming out, keeping it super positive -- I think it can change some minds and change some hearts,"" she said. ""Because she's still exactly who she was two days ago or two weeks ago, and they're seeing that. It's that visibility that softens people's minds and hearts over time.""

It's impactful, too, Duron said, for parents to see the support JoJo's parents have shown her publicly.

In her follow-up video, JoJo ends with something her dad told her earlier: ""'Hey man, love is universal!'""

Jessalyn Siwa, JoJo's mom who appeared with her daughter for two seasons on ""Dance Moms,"" supported JoJo on Instagram : ""The best thing you can be is yourself and the best gift you can give someone is to love them for exactly who they are always and forever.""

""That's so important to see, that adults can be safe and loving and supportive,"" Duron said. ""I think it's very important for her audience to see, as well -- that she's loved and accepted at home.""

She's got no time for haters

Whether JoJo makes her identity a bigger part of her empire remains to be seen, but her announcement itself was already a major step for children's entertainment. It was only in 2018 that a major studio released a film centered on a gay teen love story -- ""Love, Simon,"" whose high school protagonist was closeted for much of the film. Tropes of queer protagonists have been upturned in shows like ""Sex Education,"" ""Riverdale"" and ""Schitt's Creek,"" but those series are geared toward teens and adults.

JoJo came out in her own way, on her own terms -- and fans are largely standing behind her, as is Nickelodeon, which signed JoJo to a talent deal in 2017. When reached for comment by CNN, a representative referred to Nickelodeon's Instagram post -- a photo of JoJo with the caption ""Never been more proud.""

Her admission still courted, as JoJo calls them, ""haters."" Some followers -- many of them parents -- claimed their children would never watch another one of her videos.

To one user, she responded with typical pep -- ""Okay!""

JoJo Siwa performed with Nicole Scherzinger on ""The Masked Singer.""

The hate became dangerous at one point, though. JoJo said her house was ""swatted, "" meaning someone called a SWAT team to her home on a fake call. The incident scared her, she said on her videographer's Instagram livestream

Still, Gillig said, ""the long-term impact of her coming out will be undoubtedly positive for LGBTQ people.""

It has been already, in just the last week, for Duron's son. He giddily sends her TikToks from JoJo and rushes into her bedroom to show her new videos from the bow-clad star.

""It just makes him so happy,"" she said. ""He still doesn't sometimes feel totally safe and doesn't see that visibility out in the world, so to see that and to see it from someone -- he sees her picture when we're out shopping -- it's just meaning so much.""

On Instagram Live, JoJo's joy bubbled over. She giggled, she grinned, she used ""awesome"" in every other sentence. She joked that her face started to cramp up from smiling so much.

Not even the haters could dim her glow.

""Why would she, with the platform and power she has, want to hide a huge part of herself just to make a few hateful people comfortable, when her whole message is to be loudly, proudly yourself?"" Gutowitz said. ""It doesn't make sense for her, and she doesn't have to do it. And that's a powerful message.""

Shortly after her buoyant Instagram Live address, JoJo took off to Canada, where she'll stay for months to film a secret project. When and if she's ready, she'll tell more of her story to her largely adoring public. But for now, she's said enough.

Her happiness speaks for itself."
"Transmission of coronavirus in schools can be limited if kids mask up, study suggests","(CNN) An in-depth look at two US schools supports the argument that children don't spread coronavirus in school -- if and when proper precautions are taken.

Out of 3,500 students, just 234 coronavirus infections were documented during the fall semester, the researchers reported in a pre-print study posted online.

Just 9% of students who brought new infections to school infected others, the researchers found.

""There was no evidence of student-to-teacher or teacher-to-student transmission in either school,"" they wrote.

""To our knowledge, this is the only, comprehensive and long-term study that tested all K-12 students (asymptomatic) and staff from August through December - making it the only one where we really see disease incidence in this age group and true spread in schools,"" Dr. Darria Long of the University of Tennessee Department of Emergency Medicine, who worked on the study, told CNN."
"Government needs a ""really centralized protocol"" for schools to reopen, doctor says","A new study of two independent US schools supports the argument that children don't spread coronavirus in school when proper precautions are taken.

Just 9% of students — out of 3,500 students studied — who brought new Covid-19 infections to school ended up infecting others, researchers found.

“And of those 9% that actually did transmit to someone else, we could almost invariably trace them back to a violation of the protocol. So the testing really enforced that when the protocols are followed, they work. When they're not followed is when you can have a breakdown,” Dr. Darria Long of the University of Tennessee Department of Emergency Medicine, who worked on the study, told CNN.

As President Biden has pledged to reopen most schools during his administration’s first 100 days, Long said the study can be used as a roadmap by larger schools.

“They need a really centralized protocol,” Long said.

In addition, schools need to increase rapid testing, she added.

“We have to make testing available and affordable,” Long said. ""It's incumbent upon the government to help make that feasible for schools.”

Biden makes his case to the American people for Covid-19 relief,"(CNN) President Joe Biden came to Washington with big dreams of bipartisanship, but the practicalities are now setting in.

With Congress still deeply polarized following former President Donald Trump's acrimonious exit, and with dangerous variants of the coronavirus circulating in the US, the President signaled a new sense of urgency Friday about the need to get his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package passed -- even if he is not able to bring Republicans along.

Meeting with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in the Oval Office, the President warned of the ""cost of inaction,"" pointing to alarming new job losses, the hunger that some 30 million Americans are facing every day, as well as the possibility that ""an entire cohort of kids"" could face ""lower lifetime earnings because they're deprived of another semester of school.""

""We have to act now; there's no time for delay,"" Biden said.

He punctuated that point less than two hours later on his way to visit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center when a reporter asked him whether he was willing to achieve his goals by using reconciliation -- an arcane procedural tactic that would allow Democrats to pass the relief bill on a party-line vote.

""I support passing Covid relief with support from Republicans if we can get it,"" Biden replied. ""But the Covid relief has to pass. There's no ifs, ands or buts.""

Biden has been firm about his efforts to reach across the aisle, but he is making it evident that he does not intend to wait forever before pressing ahead with his agenda. Administration officials are expected to continue their outreach to Republican senators through this weekend and into next week, and Biden has personally reached out to more moderate GOP senators like Susan Collins of Maine and Rob Portman of Ohio.

But his team is also increasingly making their case to the American people , as the administration faces resistance to the size and scope of the bill from the GOP. In all of Friday's White House events, the underlying message was clear, and aimed squarely at the American people: your daily lives will not change without a substantial relief package to reinvigorate the economy and give schools and health care providers the resources they need to speed up vaccinations.

Persuading that broader audience could be an effective tool as frustration grows across America about the slow pace of vaccinations and the anemic economy -- one that could nudge wavering Democrats and some Republicans to get on board.

It was no coincidence that Vice President Kamala Harris popped up this week in the backyards of moderate Democratic senators like Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, to press for swift passage of Biden's proposal. Speaking to editors and executives from the Charleston Gazette-Mail and Herald-Dispatch in West Virginia, Harris made the case that lives are on the line.

""If we don't pass this bill, it is our sincere belief that more people will die who should not, more people will lose their jobs who should not and more children will miss critical days in class,"" Harris said to her audience in Manchin's home state, according to the report in the Charleston Gazette-Mail

Manchin, however, appeared to express frustration Friday over a television interview Harris did with CNN affiliate WSAZ to promote the administration's Covid-19 relief proposal.

""I saw it. I couldn't believe it. No one called me,"" the Democratic senator said in an interview with the same West Virginia station . ""We're going to try to find a bipartisan pathway forward. I think we need to, but we need to work together. That's not a way of working together, what was done.""

Harris' office did not respond to a request for comment. Manchin's office also has not responded to questions about recent outreach between the senator and the White House.

'We need to act now'

The administration's sense of urgency was plain on Friday in the comments from Biden's coronavirus advisers in their press briefing; from Yellen, moments before she briefed the President on the economy; and from White House press secretary Jen Psaki at the podium in the White House briefing room.

Talking about the current threats that the virus poses to the economic recovery, the millions of children who are being deprived of in-person education -- and the unpredictability of the virus itself through the lens of the administration's scientists -- they were all making the case that Biden's proposal would get normal life back on track.

During a briefing by the White House Covid response team — where Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the President, warned about the dangers of the emerging virus variants from countries like South Africa and Brazil -- both stressed the importance of speeding up the pace of vaccinations, a key goal of Biden's legislative package.

Now that it is clear that the US will continue to see ""the evolution of mutants,"" Fauci said Friday, the government and vaccine makers must become more ""nimble"" and ""adjust readily"" to make versions of the vaccines that can handle the mutations.

He said it was likely that some mutations of the virus, like the variant found in the UK, could become more dominant in this country by March or early April, underscoring the need to quicken the pace of vaccinating as many Americans as possible before then: ""The fundamental principle of getting people vaccinated as quickly and as efficiently as you possibly can will always be the best way to prevent the further evolution of any mutant,"" he said. ""Because when you do that, you prevent replication, and replication is essential for mutation.""

Walensky noted that reopening schools remains a top priority for the administration, along with millions of parents across America, and argued that ""accumulating data"" has shown that school settings don't result in the rapid spread of the virus when proper precautions are taken, like masking, distancing and ventilation.

""But we recognize many communities lack sufficient capacity to do all that is needed,"" she said, alluding to cash-strapped school districts that have not been able to reduce student density and put those safety measures in place. ""That is why it is essential that the guidance, tools and resources called for in the national strategy for the Covid-19 response and the American Rescue Plan are provided to communities,"" she said referring to Biden's proposed legislation.

In comments to reporters before her meeting with Biden on the current economic data, Yellen noted that over a million people applied for unemployment insurance just last week -- ""that's far more than in the worst week of the Great Recession,"" she said.

""Economists agree that if there's not more help, many more people will lose their small businesses, the roofs over their heads, and the ability to feed their families. And we need to help those people before the virus is brought under control,"" Yellen said. ""The President is absolutely right: The price of doing nothing is much higher than the price of doing something, and doing something big. We need to act now, and the benefits of acting now and acting big will far outweigh the costs in the long run.""

'Creative steps'

In her briefing, Psaki hinted that the President will be taking ""creative steps"" in the coming weeks to build support for his proposal that will include more local interviews like the ones Harris did this week, as well as engaging state and local leaders to build consensus.

""He fully recognizes, as do we, the importance of speaking directly to the American people about the components of this package, whether it's the importance of funding to get schools open or get vaccines in the arms of Americans, or just ensure that people know they can put food on the table,"" Psaki said.

And as they make that case, there's no doubt the administration hopes they'll be able to change the minds of some key lawmakers in the process."
A vaccination site meant to serve a hard-hit Latino neighborhood in New York instead serviced more Whites from other areas,"(CNN) A Covid-19 vaccination site in a Latino neighborhood in New York City hard hit by the pandemic saw an overwhelming number of White people from outside the community show up to get the shot this month, city leaders say, laying bare a national disparity that shows people of color are being vaccinated at dramatically lower rates.

The site at the Armory Track & Field Center in Washington Heights was launched Jan. 14 by NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Vaccine appointments were initially offered to people age 65 and older who live in New York state.

Lawmakers who represent Washington Heights and a doctor who staffed the site last week said the first wave of vaccinations went to many White New Yorkers over 65 who traveled to the Armory from other parts of the city and state.

Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday called it ""outrageous.""

""The more I learn about this, the angrier I get,"" de Blasio said during a virtual press briefing. ""Somehow instead of focusing on the Latino community of Washington Heights, a place that really was hit hard by Covid, instead the approach was somehow conducive to folks from outside the community coming and getting vaccinated but not folks who live right there in Washington Heights. Totally backwards.""

'New Yorkers of color' were to get shots

The issue at the Washington Heights site is a glaring example of the inequity in vaccine access across the country.

In a news release announcing the launch , Cuomo said the goal of the partnership with NewYork-Presbyterian, Weill Cornell Medicine and Columbia University Irving Medical Center was ""making sure New Yorkers of color aren't left behind.""

CNN reached out to NewYork-Presbyterian on Wednesday to ask about the disparity and a hospital spokeswoman provided a statement saying ""effective immediately"" the site would dedicate all appointment slots to New York City residents , with at least 60% reserved for eligible residents in the Washington Heights, Inwood, North and Central Harlem, and South Bronx communities.

NewYork-Presbyterian said in an email to CNN Friday that in the last two days more than 80% of the people vaccinated have been residents of those communities.

""An ongoing engagement initiative is focused on reaching eligible Northern Manhattan residents and getting them registered for appointments,"" the hospital said in its statement Wednesday. ""This process is being undertaken in partnership with more than 40 community-based and faith-based organizations and other partners, and is focused on providing access, overcoming hesitancy and addressing persistent inequities.""

More than 25,000 people have been vaccinated at the site since it opened, according to the hospital. NewYork-Presbyterian did not have a racial breakdown of the vaccine recipients.

Washington Heights and neighboring Inwood, which according to the 2018 NYC Health report are 72% Latino, have been a hotbed for Covid-19 cases . Latinos make up 30% of deaths in New York City.

'It's like 'The Hunger Games' '

New York City Councilman Mark Levine told CNN the initial sign-up process for the Armory site required several steps for registration and eligibility screening and did not accommodate the Washington Heights residents who don't speak English and aren't tech savvy.

In Washington Heights/Inwood, 37% of residents have ""limited English proficiency,"" according to the 2018 NYC Health report.

A Jan. 14 statement on the state of New York's website said people who were eligible to get the vaccine could sign up through a portal site for Columbia, New York-Presbyterian, and Weill Cornell Medicine patients or create a new account on a separate page.

""It's like 'The Hunger Games,' "" Levine said. ""People who don't have a computer, don't have good internet, aren't comfortable with technology, maybe have limited English language skills, they are not getting through. And that's reflected in who is showing up at these sites.""

Dr. Susana Bejar of Columbia University Irving Medical Center said she witnessed the disparity in Washington Heights firsthand when she volunteered at the Armory as an appointment verifier on Jan. 23.

Bejar said of the 2,400 people who received the vaccine that day, most were not from the local community. ""Simply put, I've never seen so many White people in Washington Heights,"" Bejar tweeted on Sunday.

Bejar said the site needs to prioritize Washington Heights residents by allowing same day and walk-in appointments, reserving vaccines for those who live in the community, offering help to people who are struggling to sign up on the smartphone app, and ensuring residents have time to schedule their appointments.

""It's hard to do both speed and equity,"" Bejar told CNN. ""When the vaccines are primarily distributed through a smart phone application in English to whoever refreshes the application first, longstanding structural inequities will replicate themselves unless the medical community makes a conscious and consistent effort to address them.""

The need for community partnerships

Disparities in who is getting the Covid-19 vaccine is a nationwide problem.

A CNN analysis of 14 states found vaccine coverage is twice as high among White people on average than it is among Black and Latino people.

The analysis found that on average more than 4% of the White population has received a Covid-19 vaccine, about 2.3 times higher than the Black population (1.9% covered) and 2.6 times higher than the Hispanic population (1.8% covered).

De Blasio said vaccine providers should be partnering with community groups, local health care providers, clergy and trusted community leaders to ensure people of color have fair access.

The problem is compounded by the fact that New York has seen a shortage of vaccines, with Cuomo saying this week that there were not enough dosages for the 7 million people who are eligible to get the shot under federal guidelines.

""We are nowhere near the supply we need,"" De Blasio said at the Friday press briefing.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY) said his office received several complaints about the local community being left out of the vaccinations at the Armory. Espaillat said he believes it was an oversight and that partnerships with local churches and senior centers will be critical for vaccination efforts in Washington Heights.

""From day one I have been concerned about the vaccine distribution not allowing rich people to make their way in and push our people out so they can jump the line and get the shot first,"" Espaillat said. ""I think it's fixed now but we are going to monitor it for the next few days.""

Community groups in Washington Heights say they need to be involved in all distribution efforts if health care leaders want to reach people of color.

Jon-Paul Dyson, program director of Community League of the Heights, or CLOTH, said many residents don't have Wi-fi or email access so they rely on word of mouth, literature in the mail or their social service providers to get information.

Dyson said he is working with the health care community to help get residents vaccinated.

""Education is the biggest piece that's missing right now,"" Dyson said Thursday. ""The locations of where to go, the transportation for our seniors to get there, all of the above."""
"When Covid-19 vaccines are about to expire, health care workers must scramble to make sure they are used","(CNN) Mechanical breakdowns. Bad weather. Expiration deadlines. The earliest phases of Covid-19 vaccine distribution in some instances have left doctors, nurses, and health officials scrambling to inoculate Americans.

In the worst cases, valuable doses have been wasted or thrown out. However, quick thinking by practitioners mixed with a bit of luck have found them administering vaccines in unique circumstances.

On Thursday night, after a freezer containing vaccine doses malfunctioned in Seattle, a nearby hospital had less than nine hours to administer more than 800 vaccinations before they spoiled. Vaccines from Pfizer-BioTech and Moderna require certain low temperatures for storage and have a limited shelf life when exposed to room temperature.

Swedish Health Services told CNN it quickly signed up eligible recipients on short notice via social media. Clinical and non-clinical hospital volunteers convened to run the site.

""No vaccine went to waste last night,"" spokesperson Tiffany Moss told CNN on Friday.

Swedish was not the only location to assist that night. An additional supply from the broken freezer made its way to the University of Washington, where staff and volunteers administered vaccines at two of its centers, according to CNN affiliate KOMO.

Clever solutions and fast action by health workers nationwide, when faced with the total loss of a vaccine supply, have benefited those in the right place at the right time.

Only while supplies last

On January 4, similar to Thursday's recovery in Seattle, a California hospital discovered its freezer storing Moderna vaccines was broken.

Officials at Mendocino County's Adventist Health Ukiah Valley Medical Center told CNN they realized after a safety inspection that they had roughly two hours to administer more than 800 doses.

""It was our main focus to make sure that we got every single vaccine into every arm,"" Adventist Health executive Judson Howe told CNN. ""We reached out to the county public health officer and informed them of the situation and with a collaborative approach, we were able to administer all 830 vaccines in a matter of two hours.""

""The reality is we were presented with a tough situation and we weren't going to let any vaccine go to waste,"" Howe said.

About 200 doses went to the county to administer, 70 went to skilled nursing facilities and the rest went to four clinics, prioritized according to state guidelines, medical officer Dr. Bessant Parker said.

""Given that this was an emergency, we focused on as many people as we could quickly mobilize within the tiers, and then the rest was to the general public on a first-come, first-served basis,"" Parker said.

In Oregon, Josephine County Public Health Department workers were returning from a mass vaccination clinic Tuesday when members of the group were stranded in their cars in a snowstorm.

The group had six leftover doses of the vaccine, according to the health department. To keep those doses from going unused before they expired, the workers went from car to car to offer people the chance to get a shot.

The workers found six takers, including a sheriff's office employee who had intended to be at the earlier mass vaccination event but got stuck in the snow, according to the health department. A nearby ambulance monitored in case any recipients experienced an adverse reaction.

Wasted opportunities

Other situations on the ground have not had the same success.

On January 22, nearly 2,000 doses of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine stored in a hospital freezer in Boston were compromised after a cleaning contractor accidentally loosened the freezer's plug. The alarm system installed did not work as expected.

In Ohio, the Department of Health announced on January 20 it was halting allocations to a Columbus vaccine provider after nearly 900 doses were wasted through improper transport. An investigation has begun over concerns the refrigeration temperatures were not monitored sufficiently.

A shipment of 4,400 doses to Maine on January 18 were initially deemed out of the proper temperature range, according to the state Center for Disease Control and Prevention. An ongoing investigation by the vaccine distributor later determined the doses may still be usable because they could have been stored in too cold of a temperature rather than too warm.

One other reported failure may have been intentional. In December, a pharmacist in Wisconsin was fired and later arrested for removing vaccine vials from storage, rendering them useless. Investigators believed the man removed the vaccine ""knowing they would not be usable,"" according to a statement.

With frustration mounting from state governors and local officials about the vaccine rollout , some say the need to protect every dose remains imperative.

California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly spoke earlier this month about the necessity for each vaccine to be used when excess supply is available, even for recipients who fall outside the highest tiers of need.

""We just want to say that we should not waste vaccine,"" Ghaly said. ""We know that our providers and those who are in charge of vaccinating are very thoughtful, innovative people, that they have access to individuals who are in those higher-risk tiers. And they should do all that they can to make sure that they're giving vaccine to those who have been deemed highest risk based on our priority groups and our faces and our tears.""

""But by all means, don't waste vaccine."""
Beautiful Italian town sells ready-to-occupy homes at bargain prices,"(CNN) — If you've been tempted to pick up one of the dilapidated houses offered for sale in Italy for little more than $1 but had second thoughts about the hassle of renovating it, one town has an offer that might just tempt you.

Biccari, deep in the southeastern region of Puglia, is also selling off dilapidated homes priced at €1, but unlike other destinations , it also has bargain deals on ready-to-occupy places.

Prices of empty turnkey dwellings start as low as €7,500 ($9,000). Most are in the range of €10,000-€13,000.

The sale is part of Mayor Gianfilippo Mignogna's mission to save his ailing hometown from the grave after years of people leaving to pursue jobs in Italy's cities or abroad, mainly to the United States. The slow exodus has taken a toll on a population that peaked at 5,000 in the 1950s.

""We're barely 2,000 residents,"" he tells CNN . ""Depopulation is an open wound, a steady phenomenon. Locals keep leaving and while most used to come back during the summer to visit, now they no longer do so. Many habitable houses are empty and are falling into oblivion.""

He says he now wants to recover the buildings they left behind.

Cute homes

""One day I was wandering through the old center, and it struck me how so many cute little homes in a perfect shape had been shut for years, tucked away in silent alleys, with signs 'for rent or sale' that nobody sees.

""I thought the best way was to involve those no-longer interested owners to sell them right off.""

There are roughly a dozen €1 and 20 ""upper-scale"" homes available but potentially more than 100 empty buildings in Biccari are in need of new occupants.

Photos and maps of the properties will soon be put online on the town hall website but interested people are invited to contact Mignogna (sindaco@comune.biccari.fg.it).

The online platform will be divided into two sections: €1 homes and cheap houses.

Those who settle for a dilapidated €1 dwelling must stump up a guarantee sum of €3,000 to be returned once the works are completed, possibly within three years. But unlike other Italian towns that have launched similar schemes, the completion deadline will be extended if work is well underway and there's a good reason to for the delay.

The 'roof' of Puglia

Biccari boasts an impressive location. Straddling the border between three regions -- Puglia, Molise and Campania -- it's surrounded by the pristine Daunia Mountains, thick forests, herd-grazing fields, olive groves and a lake.

Biccari is set at the foot of the region's highest peak, Monte Cornacchia (aka the Carrion Crow's Mount). From the top, there's a view stretching to the Adriatic Coast, the Gargano Promontory and the Tremiti Islands. The area is known as ""the roof of Puglia.""

Biccari's name is believed to stem from the Italian word ""bicchiere,"" meaning glass, as the village has the shape of an upside-down cup.

The countryside is dotted with ruins of prehistoric settlements and old farms.

Founded by the ancient Romans on the ashes of a primitive village, Biccari went on centuries later to flourish in the Middle Ages. Not much is left of its old fortified walls but one single tower that still stands at the village entrance and hosts art shows and museum exhibitions.

A land of shepherds, monks and once even outlaws, Biccari is surrounded by a network of old trails and trekking paths winding across hills equipped picnic areas. It's a wild patch of Puglia roamed by wolves, foxes and wild boars.

""We're a corner of paradise, ideal for slow- ourism,"" says Mignogna. ""The fresh mountain air and natural surroundings offer a detox, unplugged stay far from city chaos, pollution and noise.""

Securing the future

Biccari's cobblestone alleys are lined with old and brightly colored newer houses. Crumbling stone dwellings with cracked wooden doors, broken window panes and peeling wall paint are juxtaposed with picture-perfect homes with ornate stone arches, little courtyards and painted windows with flower pots.

The €1 and more expensive houses on sale are all located in the ancient district surrounding the majestic tower. The turnkey houses are smaller, roughly 50-70 square meters spread over two floors, some with views of the green rolling hills dotted with wind turbines. Shut for years, most are second homes of emigrant families, well kept but no longer used by their descendants.

New owners might want to make minimal changes depending upon personal tastes but the mayor says the cheap houses are already habitable, and perhaps a better deal than those on sale for €1, as their price could be lower than the cost of renovating a more dilapidated building.

Mignogna says that reaching out to the heirs of the dilapidated homes, who are often spread across the world, can be troublesome but reviving the old district is also a matter of safety.

""I will expropriate the properties of old owners who don't answer to our call to restyle their unstable family house or alternatively hand it over to us. Roof tiles often fall off and that's a danger for passersby. The town's urban architecture must be secured.""

Bloody past

While the village may be in need of a thorough makeover, the scenery is idyllic. The surrounding woods offer ""nature-adventure"" stays and experiences including lessons on environmental awareness, archery and survival skills sessions.

There are treehouses where tourists can sleep suspended above the ground and acrobatic ""tree walks"" on ropes.

Biccari has a dark past, some of which is portrayed in strange images that decorate the village's walls. Portals of old houses bear signs of battles and attacks by outlaws and secessionists fighting against the ""tyrannical"" Italian state back in the 1800s. Murders and hangings are said to have taken place in the public piazza.

Fiery locals are proud of their bandit heritage. Villagers used to shelter wanted outlaws and still celebrate them as heroes. A ""bloody"" tourist guided trail leads visitors to key places of uprising with sculptures of historically significant people who lost their lives.

Another Biccari hero is native Ralph de Palma, a popular Italian-American race-car driver who won the 1915 Indianapolis 500 after migrating to the States. A museum in town is dedicated to him.

Cheese and sausages

The region is known for its waistline-stretching food. At the annual pizze e furne aperte fair, tourists are treated to a special kind of flat white pizza made in open ovens using an ancient technique. Chili powder is sprinkled on top.

It's a cheese heaven. ""U' Mascjuottele"" is a premium hard cheese made with local goat's milk. It can be eaten fresh or dry and grated over dishes. Goats in Biccari are known as ""the cows of the poor"" and have always been the main source of proteins.

The extra virgin olive is one of Puglia's most savory and the first trees are believed to have been brought by ancient Greek colonizers.

Sausages made with wild baby black piglet, which has a tastier meat, are another top delicacy. Families hang salami and sausages from ceiling hooks. And there are many pasta plates with premium local truffles and wild mountain flowers and herbs."
"How 'Oumuamua, first interstellar visitor to our solar system, may have formed","(CNN) The first observed interstellar object blazed through our solar system more than two years ago.

Astronomers scrambled to observe the object in October 2017 before it disappeared, and their observations caused more questions than answers about the ""oddball.""

Now, researchers have used a computer simulation to determine how the object may have formed.

After discovery, the object was dubbed 'Oumuamua, Hawaiian for ""a messenger that reaches out from the distant past."" At first, astronomers expected that it was a comet because it was long believed that the first object spotted in our solar system that originated from outside of it would be one.

That's because comets can be tossed out of their host systems through gravitational disturbances and they're also very visible. The second interstellar object discovered in our solar system was an interstellar comet, 2I/Borisov , which was observed in 2019.

But the dry, rocky reddish, elongated cigar-shaped object had no cometary tail, and its tumbling motion couldn't be explained. And debate has emerged over whether it's an interstellar asteroid or comet.

And, of course, there was speculation that 'Oumuamua was a type of alien probe.

So Yun Zhang, postdoctoral researcher at the Université Côte d'Azur and Douglas Lin, professor emeritus in the department of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, used simulations to show how they believe 'Oumuamua formed.

The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy , postulated that 'Oumuamua was once part of a planetary body in another solar system, ripped apart by its host star before being kicked out into space.

""The discovery of 'Oumuamua implies that the population of rocky interstellar objects is much larger than we previously thought,"" Zhang said. ""On average, each planetary system should eject in total about a hundred trillion objects like 'Oumuamua. We need to construct a very common scenario to produce this kind of object.""

Using simulations, Zhang and Lin modeled what would happen if a smaller planetary body came too close to its host star. They found that if the planet was close enough to the star, within 186,411 miles, it would be ripped into long pieces. Then, they would be shot out into interstellar space.

They also included thermal modeling to determine what would happen to the fragment split off from the planet. Elements like water, would melt on the surface of the object before re-condensing into a strong, stable crust as the object moved further away.

""[This] not only explains 'Oumuamua's surface colors and the absence of visible coma [comet tail], but also elucidates the inferred dryness of the interstellar population,"" Zhang said.

Astronomers have wondered what is essentially powering the object forward. 'Oumuamua doesn't have the tail of a comet, but if condensed water existed on the object, it could be releasing and melting, accelerating the object in a comet-like way. This would explain its odd motions.

Based on their models, 'Oumuamua could have originated from a half-mile-sized planetesimal, which is a precursor to a planet. Or it could have come from a rocky super-Earth exoplanet (larger than Earth), orbiting a low-mass star or white dwarf, which is the hot core of a star that has exhausted its energy.

Learning more about this object could prepare scientists to understand other interstellar objects as they pass through our solar system in the future. And given that they could originate in solar systems with potentially habitable planets, the information these objects carry is of great interest.

""This is a very new field. These interstellar objects could provide critical clues about how planetary systems form and evolve,"" Zhang said.

""'Oumuamua is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Lin said. ""We anticipate many more interstellar visitors with similar traits will be discovered by future observation with the forthcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory.""

Pioneering American astronomer Vera Rubin once mentored fellow aspiring female astronomers and advocated for women in science. It's fitting that the first national US observatory named for a female astronomer is in her honor.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, named after the pioneering American astronomer, is located in Chile but run by America's National Science Foundation. It will begin science operations in 2022. It is designed to map the Milky Way, explore dark energy and dark matter, survey the solar system and explore the transient sky."
"Some states could vaccinate their seniors twice as fast as others, CNN analysis finds","Some states could fully vaccinate their 65-and-older population within two months, but it could take more than twice as long for others, a CNN analysis found.

If individuals age 65 and older were the only people being vaccinated, Alaska could fully vaccinate its seniors – with both shots of the two-dose regimen – within 43 days. In Iowa, Hawaii, Idaho and Florida, it could take more than 130 days, or more than four months.

The analysis considered the total senior population in each state, along with the average pace of vaccine administration over the past seven days, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In four states, more than one in five people are 65 or older, according to data from the US Census Bureau: Maine, Florida, West Virginia and Vermont.

At the current pace of vaccinations, it would take Florida 131 days to fully vaccinate its senior population if they were the only group being vaccinated. However, West Virginia is administering vaccines at a per capita rate that’s about 32% faster than Florida, and could fully vaccinate its senior population in 87 days.

About two weeks ago, the federal government – under the Trump administration – issued new guidance to states to expand vaccine eligibility to adults 65 years old and older, along with health care workers and long-term care residents and staff. But both Florida and West Virginia had adapted their plans to focus on senior populations sooner.

Florida’s vaccination plan has left many frustrated by apparent lack of coordination, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has defended the state’s plan and its emphasis on protecting older people.

“We put seniors first and other states soon followed,” he said at a press conference.

About a quarter of Florida’s senior population – more than 1.1 million people 65 years or older – had received at least one vaccine dose, according to the state’s latest vaccine report.

In West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice said in a news conference Monday that nearly 74,000 seniors had received at least one dose of vaccine – about 20% of the state’s 65 and older population.

While vaccine administration may be moving faster in some states, the focus on the senior population may not be as high.

In Michigan, for example, vaccine administration is 17% faster than Florida. But only 17% of seniors in the state have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to the state’s vaccine dashboard."
Cicely Tyson's radiant power (opinion),"Sherrilyn Ifill is the president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund Inc. (LDF). The views expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) For Black women of a certain age, Cicely Tyson, who died this week, holds a very particular place as an artist.

Sherrilyn Ifill

Many of us were introduced to her when we were at the age where girls often feel ugly, awkward, self-critical. For brown-skinned Black girls in the 1970s, the African-ness of our looks left our beauty, or even our aspirations to beauty, in debate. The color of our skin, our broad noses, the texture of our hair -- despite the strong ""Black is Beautiful"" moment -- were not the standard of beauty presented on television, where we saw ourselves only rarely in prominent roles, especially in the ubiquitous television movies of the time.

Enter Cicely Tyson -- a brilliant actress, luminous beauty and unapologetically Black actress of such exceptional talent that she changed the game. In her powerful television portrayals in ""Roots,"" in the ""Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,"" we saw someone who looked like women in our families.

She wore her hair natural and in braids. She was thin and not voluptuous. Most important for me was that in every frame in which her face was on the screen it was clear that she, as the character, was...thinking. Whoever she portrayed had ideas, feelings, plans and dreams. She could convey this with just one look. And this was as important as her physical beauty.

An actress who looked like us and who could demonstrate in her performances the existence of the rich interior life of Black women was, in those days, and frankly still in these days, a powerful source of affirmation -- a display of our humanity for all to see.

"Chinese millennials aren't getting married, and the government is worried","She worked for a foreign trade company in China's southern metropolis of Guangzhou, earned a decent income and spent her weekends hanging out with friends. But to Su and her parents, there was one problem -- she was single.

""Back then, I felt like 30 years old was such an important threshold. When it loomed closer, I came under tremendous pressure to find the right person to marry -- both from my parents and myself,"" she said.

Now 31, Su is still single, but says she is no longer worried. ""What's the point of making do with someone you don't like, and then divorcing in a couple of years? It's only a waste of time,"" she said.

Su is among a growing number of Chinese millennials who are postponing or eschewing marriage entirely. In just six years, the number of Chinese people getting married for the first time has fallen by a crushing 41%, from 23.8 million in 2013 to 13.9 million in 2019, according to data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics

The decline is partly due to decades of policies designed to limit China's population growth, which mean there are fewer young people in China available to be married, according to Chinese officials and sociologists. But it's also a result of changing attitudes to marriage, especially among young women, some of whom are growing disillusioned with the institution for its role in entrenching gender inequality, experts say.

In extreme cases, some even took to social media to insult wives as being a ""married donkey,"" a derogatory term used to describe submissive women who conform to patriarchal rules within marriage, said Xiao Meili, a leading voice in China's feminist movement.

Xiao Meili is a leading voice in China's feminist movement.

""This kind of personal attack is wrong, but it shows the strong fear towards marriage felt by many. They hope all women can realize that marriage is an unfair institution to both the individual, and to female as a whole, and thus turn away from it,"" said Xiao, who once walked 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) to call for reform of China's child sexual abuse laws.

The declining marriage rate is a problem for Beijing

efforts to avert a Getting young people to have children is central to itsefforts to avert a looming population crisis that could severely distress its economic and social stability -- and potentially pose a risk to Chinese Communist Party rule.

""Marriage and reproduction are closely related. The decline in the marriage rate will affect the birth rate, which in turn affects economic and social developments,"" Yang Zongtao, an official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said at a news conference last year.

""This (issue) should be brought to the forefront,"" he said, adding that the ministry will ""improve relevant social policies and enhance propaganda efforts to guide the public to establish positive values on love, marriage and family.""

Alarming statistics

In 2019, China's marriage rate plunged for the sixth year in a row to 6.6 per 1,000 people -- a 33% drop from 2013 and the lowest level in 14 years, according to data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

Chinese officials have attributed the decline to a drop in the number of people of marriageable age, due to the one-child policy, a deliberate strategy introduced in 1979 to control China's population.

But demographers have been warning for years of a looming population crisis. In 2014, the country's working-age population started to shrink for the first time in more than three decades, alarming Chinese leaders.

The next year, the Chinese government announced an end to the one-child policy, allowing couples to have two children. It went into force on January 1, 2016, but both marriage and birth rates have dropped anyway. Between 2016 and 2019, birth declined from 13 per 1,000 people to 10 -- a trend not helped by the fact women are emancipating and millennials have different values.

The decline of marriage is not unique to China. Across the globe , marriage rates have fallen over the past few decades, especially in richer Western countries. Compared with other East Asian societies like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, China still has the highest marriage rate, said Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore who has studied marriage and family across Asian societies.

But no other country has tried to social engineer its population in the way China did with its one-child policy.

That policy has also affected marriages in other ways, Yeung said. Chinese families' traditional preference for sons has led to a skewed sex ratio at birth, especially in rural areas. Currently, China has a surplus of more than 30 million men, who will face a hard time looking for brides.

Social economic changes

Demographic changes alone don't explain the drastic drop in China's marriage rate. Women are becoming more educated, and economically more independent.

boost university enrollments. By 2016, women started In the 1990s, the Chinese government accelerated the rollout of nine-year compulsory education, bringing girls in poverty-stricken areas into the classroom. In 1999, the government expanded higher education toboost university enrollments. By 2016, women started outnumbering men in higher education programs, accounting for 52.5% of college students and 50.6% of postgraduate students.

""With increased education, women gained economic independence, so marriage is no longer a necessity for women as it was in the past,"" Yeung said. ""Women now want to pursue self-development and a career for themselves before they get married.""

It's not just marrying someone, it's to marry the in-laws, take care of children -- there are a lot of responsibilities that come with marriage. Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, a sociologist

But gender norms and patriarchal traditions have not caught up with these changes. In China, many men and parents-in-law still expect women to carry out most of the childcare and housework after marriage, even if they have full-time jobs.

""The whole package of marriage is too hard. It's not just marrying someone, it's to marry the in-laws, take care of children -- there are a lot of responsibilities that come with marriage,"" Yeung said.

Meanwhile, job discrimination against women is commonplace, making it difficult for women to have both a career and children.

""More and more young women are thinking: Why am I doing this? What's in there for me?"" said Li Xuan, an assistant professor of psychology at New York University Shanghai who researches families. ""(The gender inequality) is really making young Chinese female hesitate before getting into the institution of marriage.""

To make matter worse, the grueling long hours and high pressure at work have left young people little time and energy to build relationships and maintain a family life, Li said.

A couple marks fingerprints on ceremonial calligraphy during a traditional group wedding in Changsha, China.

Statistics show both genders are delaying marriage. From 1990 to 2016, the average age for first marriages rose from 22 to 25 for Chinese women, and from 24 to 27 for Chinese men, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences

The figures in big cities are even higher. For example, in Shanghai in 2015, the average age for first marriages was 30 for men and 28 for women.

Su, the 31-year-old from Guangzhou, has often heard from married friends about the burden that comes with married life.

""Nowadays, women's economic capability has improved, so it's actually quite nice to live alone. If you find a man to marry and form a family, there will be much more stress and your life quality will decrease accordingly,"" she said.

The increased social and economic status of women has also made it more difficult to find a suitable partner for two groups at the opposite ends of the marriage market: highly educated, high-earning women and low-educated, low-income men.

""Traditionally, Chinese women want to 'marry up' -- that means marrying someone with higher education and income than themselves -- and men want to 'marry down,'"" Yeung said. That preference has largely remained in place, despite the rising education and income levels status of women.

Shifting values

There has also been a shift in values towards love and marriage -- changes that have come a long way since the founding of modern China.

""During Mao's era, marriage wasn't a personal choice,"" said Pan Wang, an expert on marriage in China at the University of New South Wales. During the Great Leap Forward, the ruling Communist Party encouraged people to have as many children as possible, as the country needed labor to build a socialist economy. Marriage, therefore, played a key role in socialism and nation building, she said.

In 1950, China passed the New Marriage Law, which outlawed arranged marriages and concubines, and enabled women to divorce their husbands. But in practice, arranged marriages remained commonplace, and the language of freedom of marriage and divorce was not translated into the freedom of love, Pan said.

""During the Cultural Revolution period, when you talked about love, that was (seen as) something capitalist, something people needed to struggle against,"" she said.

Students waving copies of Chairman Mao Zedong's ""Little Red Book"" parade in the streets of Beijing in June 1966 at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.

Much has changed since then. Having grown up with more freedoms than their parents and grandparents after China's reform and opening up, some Chinese millennials no longer see the institution of marriage as an obligation, but a personal choice.

Increasing social acceptance of cohabitation and premarital sex, as well as the wide availability of contraception and abortion, has enabled young people to enjoy romantic relationships outside the legal institution of marriage. They see marriage as an expression of their emotional connection, not just a means of reproduction.

Star Tong, 32, used to believe that romance, marriage and childbirth are things that should happen once a girl hits her mid-20s. Worried about being single, she attended about 10 blind dates -- mostly set up by her parents -- after she turned 25.

But none of them worked out -- Tong insists on finding a partner who shares her values and interests, and refuses to settle for someone just for the sake of tying the knot.

""Now I've realized getting married is not the only option,"" she said,""And it's totally fine to just be by myself -- I'm perfectly happy, have plenty of friends, and can focus my attention on advancing my career and taking care of myself and my parents.""

Tong said she felt encouraged by what she saw as a shift in society's attitudes towards single women.

In 2007, the state-backed All-China Women's Federation used ""leftover women"" to describe unmarried women over 27 years old. Later in the year, the Ministry of Education even added the term to the official lexicon, further popularizing its use.

Since then, the term has frequently made headlines and dominated online discussions, often as a criticism of highly educated women deemed ""too picky"" in the search of a partner. In recent years, the term has drawn criticism from feminists and scholars, and in 2017, the flagship newspaper of the Women's Federation said it would no longer use the discriminatory term in its coverage.

During festive family gatherings, Tong was often lectured by relatives not to be ""too picky"" when looking for a partner. ""I used to think 'picky' is a derogatory term,"" she said. ""But now, I think it's about me choosing what I want. And there's nothing wrong in that.""

Rising costs

Then there is the problem of the cost.

For many Chinese families, buying a home is a prerequisite for marriage. But many young couples simply don't have the money to pay for an expensive property -- and not every parent has enough savings to help out.

Li Xuan, the psychologist at NYU Shanghai, said even if buying an apartment is not necessarily wanted by everyone, the social and welfare system in China is built in such a way that home ownership has become almost crucial for couples looking for a better future for their children.

A couple poses during a wedding photo shoot next to Yangtze River in Wuhan, China.

For example, owning a home near a good school grants access to high-quality education for their children, and wealthy couples are often willing to pay a high price for these coveted properties.

Everything about getting married costs money, but I can't make money faster than these expenses. Joanna Wang, a 24-year-old student

Joanna Wang, a 24-year-old student from the southwestern city of Chengdu, has been with her boyfriend for three years. The university sweethearts plan to live together in Shanghai when she graduates from her Master's program in Hong Kong, but have no immediate plans to marry.

""Everything about getting married costs money, but I can't make money faster than these expenses,"" she said.

And the financial pressure is not only being felt in cities. In rural areas, the families of grooms must pay a ""bride price"" to her family -- usually in the form of a large sum of cash, or a house. The practice has existed in China for centuries, but the costs have soared in recent decades due to the worsening gender imbalance -- namely a surplus of rural bachelors, due to the one-child policy and rapid urbanization, which has encouraged many women to move to cities for work.

The Chinese government is worried

""The government wants to keep new kids coming,"" said Li, the psychologist from NYU Shanghai.

A one-child policy billboard saying, ""Have less children, have a better life"" greets residents on the main street of Shuangwang in southern China in 2007.

Following the two-child policy, provincial governments extended maternity leave beyond the 98 days mandated by national standards, with the highest reaching 190 days. Some cities also started giving cash subsidies to couples with a second child.

In 2019, several delegates to the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp legislature, proposed lowering the minimum marriage age to 18 for both sexes from 22 for men and 20 for women, to encourage young couples to marry earlier and have more babies. But the proposal drew criticism and ridicule online, with many pointing out that it is the social and financial pressure, instead of legal age limits, that has led young people to put off marriage.

Meanwhile, the Communist Youth League -- the CCP's youth branch -- has picked up the task of matchmaking, holding mass blind dating events to help singletons find life partners.

Authorities are not only encouraging young people to get married, they are also trying to keep married couples together.

Last year, China's national legislature introduced a 30-day ""cooling-off"" period for people filing for divorce, which went into force this year. The new law provoked criticism online, especially from women, who fear it will make it harder to leave a broken marriage -- especially for victims of domestic violence.

But so far, none of these policies appear to have reversed the fall in marriage rates.

A big part of the problem, according to experts, is none of the policies address the entrenched gender inequality that has deterred young women from entering the institution of marriage and family life -- such as traditional gender roles and job market discrimination against women.

Li said she has observed a revival of more traditional gender roles in government propaganda in recent years. ""It has a lot to do with governmental plans, and how the government sees young men and women as social resources,"" she said.

""Nowadays, there's a very strong need for care work given the culture of intensive parenting and the growing number of elderly. With the retreat of state welfare, we need more and more people to shoulder childcare and elderly care, and women are the 'default' pool of labor for such work. So I think that is part of the reason for them to be pushing women back into the family life.""

(The government) shouldn't treat women's uterus as a water tap, one that they can turn off and on as they wish. Xiao Meili, a feminist activist

Discrimination against women at work has also worsened since the relaxation of the one-child policy, as employers worry that women will now have a second child and take more maternity leave, said Xiao, the activist.

With these problems unresolved, the pressure from the state for young women to get married, stay married and have children will only further estrange them from it, she said.

""(The government) needs to change its way of thinking and encourage women to give birth from the aspects of protecting women's rights. They shouldn't treat women's uterus as a water tap, one that they can turn off and on as they wish,"" Xiao added."
"US sent ventilators around the world but can't find many now, watchdog finds","(CNN) The Trump administration spent $200 million sending thousands of ventilators around the world, starting weeks after President Donald Trump touted America as the ""king of ventilators,"" but without any established way to locate them, the Government Accountability Office found in a report released Thursday.

One hundred fifty of the ventilators went to countries with zero new cases per day on the date the government committed to sending the life-saving machines overseas, as the US edged closer to a shortage of much-needed ventilators . Kiribati and Nauru, two of the countries that received a total of 20 ventilators, have never had a confirmed case of coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization.

From late May to late September, the previous administration committed to sending 8,722 ventilators to 43 countries, but with no clear criteria for determining which countries need ventilators or how many to send, the GAO found.

In April, Trump claimed the US was the ""king of ventilators,"" despite falsely asserting that the Obama administration had left him with none. In fact, the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN that the US had 16,660 ventilators on hand -- almost all that had been in the nation's stockpile since the end of the previous administration -- with another 2,425 in maintenance. But there was still a severe shortage across the globe, and the US was reaching the peak of its first wave of infections, with approximately 2,000 deaths per day in mid-April.

As the pandemic began to surge in late March, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of ventilators and N95 masks, two key components in the battle against the coronavirus.

From Dr. Fauci's and Dr. Walensky's responses, it was clear that the US government's Covid-19 response is not going to make delivering higher filtration masks to the general public a priority any time soon.

We are disappointed, and we disagree.

Dr. Fauci -- who reiterated that wearing any mask is most important -- is right. But that wasn't the question, nor is that the bar we should still be striving for. Sure, folding a cloth t-shirt around your nose and mouth is better than nothing. But the question is whether, a year into this pandemic, more protective masks are needed. We believe the answer is resoundingly yes, as we have advocated for this since last spring

found in N95 caliber masks. Part of the reason is that new Covid-19 variants are more transmissible -- meaning you are possibly more likely to be infected with even less exposure time and from greater distances than before. As Dr. Walensky herself mentions, ongoing studies are evaluating the efficacy of cloth masks in light of new variants. Without definitive answers, the precautionary principle -- erring on the side of caution -- should be invoked before more people become infected. Secondly, because -- regardless of variant -- the virus is still transmitted by both droplets and aerosols , the latter of which are best trapped by electrostatic charges

We don't fully know the extent of spread by these smaller particles because national and state-level contact tracing -- which helps us understand transmission dynamics -- cannot keep up with current spread, and is largely focused on finding droplet-based transmission that happens within 6 feet and 15 minutes (aerosols can infect beyond this distance and time).

As all three of us have heard many times, people continue to be infected and do not know how or where , despite taking all currently recommended precautions, even while wearing cloth or surgical masks. Moreover, these masks are not only less protective against contracting infection -- they are also less effective at source control (keeping an infected person from transmitting to those around them), which is especially important since the virus can be transmissible without any symptoms . While Dr. Walensky said at the town hall that she believes it is safe enough when all people are wearing any mask and distanced, the fact that some continue to not wear masks makes it even more important that those who do wear a more protective one.

A cloth or other surgical mask, even doubled up -- while better than no mask at all, as Dr. Fauci attests -- is not as good as a higher filtration masks like the N95, which is among the most protective masks we have, and which two of us (AK and RD) have used over the past year when caring for Covid-19 patients, without contracting the virus despite direct exposure from inches away. The cloth and surgical masks that the public is using also have a wide range of quality and fit, two key characteristics that can seriously compromise their effectiveness at protection. While some groups, such as the American Society for Testing and Materials and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, are starting to work on labeling the masks we are buying , this has not yet been done. People are left trying to figure out which mask to buy or make on their own -- something that this administration needs to change.

With more transmissible variants in circulation, we are advocating that N95 masks or their equivalents (such as verified KN95s, KF94s, or FFP2s) be provided by the federal government, especially to those who are most vulnerable -- such as the elderly and those with serious health conditions -- and for those with the highest exposure risks, such as frontline workers in poorly ventilated spaces. We also hope these can get to the general public for limited use, such as in public transit or essential stores.

CDC director Walensky, when asked during the town hall whether or not there was a supply issue for high filtration masks ( which there was this past year, despite the Trump administration invoking the Defense Production Act more than 30 times), responded instead by saying that N95 masks were hard to breathe in for long periods of time and expressed concern that the CDC specifically suggesting or requiring their use could make people less inclined to wear them. But most people would only need to wear these masks when in public indoor spaces or among crowds. In addition, some N95-caliber equivalents , such as KF94s and elastomeric respirators, are more comfortable to wear for even extended durations, such as for frontline workers

Most importantly, any discomfort from more protective masks pales in comparison to getting infected with Covid-19. As doctors caring for patients infected with this virus, we continue to see our most vulnerable frontline workers and others get sick and die from it. Ultimately, the government should be giving people the option of more protective masking at subsidized or no cost and decide for themselves the right balance of comfort and protection.

We hope that our public health leaders will not make similar mistakes with masks as were done earlier in the epidemic, in which masks were not recommended at all. If there is a supply issue, fix it. If it is hard to operationalize a better mask strategy right now, acknowledge it.

But don't deny that better masks are needed."
"George W. Bush to thank Dick Cheney, father of Liz Cheney, 'for his daughter's service'","(CNN) Former President George W. Bush is making it clear that he supports Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House, who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump.

Bush's chief of staff, Freddy Ford, told CNN on Friday that Bush plans to praise Liz Cheney during a Saturday call with his former vice president, her father, Dick Cheney.

When asked if Bush is planning to support Cheney if she faces a tough primary next year, Ford said, ""You're a few months ahead of us -- we aren't thinking about the next election cycle yet. But I do know that President Bush is planning to call VP Cheney tomorrow for two reasons: to wish him a happy 80th birthday, and to thank him for his daughter's service.""

The show of encouragement comes as the younger Cheney has faced intra-party criticism for joining nine other House Republicans and all House Democrats in voting to impeach Trump earlier this month for ""incitement of insurrection"" in light of his role in encouraging the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. While House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, was opposed to impeachment, House GOP leaders did not lobby their members to oppose it, and Cheney told the conference it was a "" vote of conscience .""

Two members of the Proud Boys face conspiracy charges in US Capitol riot,"(CNN) The Justice Department on Friday announced conspiracy charges against two members of the far-right Proud Boys who allegedly participated in the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6.

The new indictment against Dominic Pezzola and William Pepe, both of New York, is the first riot-related case to accuse Proud Boys members of working together to attack the Capitol.

But the men are not accused of planning the attack before coming to Washington. They have been charged with conspiring to interfere with police officers defending the Capitol, participating in civil disorder, unlawfully entering restricted grounds and other federal crimes.

Both men were first hit with charges two weeks ago. Prosecutors alleged they had removed metal barricades at the Capitol and that Pezzola had smashed a window using a police officer's riot shield. Footage of the attack shows pro-Trump rioters entering the Capitol through the broken window.

The Proud Boys are a far-right extremist group, with s ome members who espouse sexist, White nationalist and anti-Semitic views.

Senate Republicans say Trump should be held accountable for riot -- but not by them,"""No -- not at all,"" the No. 2 Republican said when asked if he can defend what Trump did. ""The way he handled the post-election, both in terms of his public statements and things that he tried to do to change the outcome, no.""

But like other Republicans, Thune has no clear answer to this key question: What should they do to Trump after he lied to his supporters about the election being stolen, promoted the January 6 rally in DC and urged demonstrators to go to the Capitol , which they later rampaged in a deadly riot?

""Well, that's a good question,"" said Thune, who faces reelection in South Dakota next year. ""One way, obviously, would be in a court of law.""

With the impeachment trial for Trump set to begin February 9 , Senate Republicans are criticizing him without doing anything about his actions, hoping to put distance between themselves and the former President without casting any votes that could cause a backlash from Trump and his fervent supporters. Many say something should be done about what Trump did -- but just not by them.

When asked about Trump's actions in relation to the January 6 riot on Capitol Hill, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of GOP leadership, said: ""I'm not going to defend them.""

""I think he's been held accountable in the court of public opinion already,"" Cornyn said when asked if the Senate should take any actions, arguing it would set a ""dangerous precedent"" to convict a former President.

The rhetoric showcases the split between House and Senate Republicans as the party struggles to find its voice after the tumultuous Trump era. Many House Republicans remain staunch Trump defenders, saying he did nothing wrong and shouldn't be blamed for the violence that occurred at the Capitol.

""President Trump did not cause the attack on the Capitol on January 6,"" freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , the controversial Georgia Republican, told her supporters this week.

A majority of House Republicans backed the efforts to throw out President Joe Biden's electoral victories in two key states, while just a handful did in the Senate. After House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California walked back his criticism of Trump and made a jaunt to South Florida on Thursday to meet with the former President, he went out of his way to proclaim they were united in their fight to take back the House next year. Back in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, made clear he hasn't spoken to Trump since December 15, and it's unclear if he ever will again.

Yet with the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection facing a sharp backlash from the right , Senate Republicans are well aware that they would face the same fate if they voted to convict next month. And McConnell, who has privately told associates he thinks Trump committed an impeachable offense, refused to say so publicly when CNN asked him on Tuesday -- and he later voted with fellow Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul on a procedural motion this week aimed at dismissing the trial on the grounds that it's unconstitutional.

Just five Republicans voted to kill Paul's procedural motion. Paul told CNN that he informed the Republican cloakroom the night before the vote about his plans, a move that allowed most Republicans to quickly align themselves behind their message that the Senate has no role in holding a trial once a president has left office.

The five who voted against Paul's effort included one who is retiring (Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania), three who either haven't said if they voted for Trump in November or voted for someone else (Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Ben Sasse of Nebraska) and another who voted to convict Trump in his first impeachment trial (Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah). Several of them argued that there is a precedent for the Senate trying former federal office holders, a key point that Democratic impeachment managers plan to make during the trial.

But with that vote earlier this week, both sides agree there's virtually no path to the 67 votes needed to convict Trump, and also bar him from office, given that Democrats hold just 50 seats in the chamber.

""I've already condemned them,"" GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said when asked if he could defend Trump's actions.

Asked what Republicans should do about it, Cassidy said: ""There is something in our nation called due process and there are things called kangaroo courts. We don't need a kangaroo court.""

Sen. Mike Braun initially signed on to objecting to Arizona's Electoral College results but then dropped that effort after rioters broke into the Capitol. Yet he also is doing the Senate GOP dance: criticizing Trump while indicating he won't convict.

""I think most would have a lot of trouble saying there was no connection"" between Trump's actions and the deadly violence, Braun said. But the Indiana Republican contended he was worried about convicting someone who's no longer in office. ""To me, it's a terrible precedent to set. He's not here, he's a private citizen.""

Asked how they should hold Trump accountable now, Braun said: ""I think he's going to be held accountable in the way that people sort him out with whatever he intends to do in the future."""
"Coachella, Stagecoach festivals canceled again because of the coronavirus pandemic","(CNN) The Coachella and Stagecoach festivals, two of Southern California's largest music celebrations, have again been canceled under an order issued Friday by the Riverside County health officer.

Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser said the decision was ""based on concerns of a fall resurgence of Covid-19 both within the county of Riverside and worldwide.""

The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Stagecoach Country Music Festival were scheduled for April. Last year, they were postponed from April until October but were eventually canceled because of the pandemic.

According to Friday's order, both music festivals attract ""hundreds of thousands of attendees from many countries,"" which could increase the risk of spread of the coronavirus.

""If Covid-19 were detected at these festivals, the scope and number of attendees and the nature of the venue would make it infeasible, if not impossible, to track those who may be placed at risk,"" Dr. Kaiser said.

"Three city police departments face upheaval after disheartening reports, chief steps down","(CNN) Police departments in cities nationwide have faced heightened pressure to reform their practices after widespread protests last summer against police brutality and racial injustice.

But this week, those challenges came to a head for police departments in Louisville, Kentucky; Columbus, Ohio; and Philadelphia -- each which has been under increased scrutiny for police shootings or their handling of protests last summer.

""This has just been a remarkable period of time for police departments, police chiefs and sheriffs, unlike any other time in recent history,"" Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) told CNN. ""Police departments have been challenged.""

While race is a factor in the challenges police departments face, Wexler said, use of force is the ""defining issue"" for police chiefs, whether in connection to police shootings or the demonstrations they spark. The departments' biggest challenge is regaining public trust, he said.

Other departments are also facing calls for reform.

In Minneapolis, city council members and advocates have called for an overhaul of the police department after the police killing of George Floyd last May.

And the Baltimore Police Department -- which has had five police commissioners since 2015 -- has entered its fourth year under a consent decree mandating sweeping reforms following years of corruption and abusive practices.

""The public's expectations have never been higher,"" Wexler told CNN. ""From a police chief's standpoint, (they're) having to rethink their strategies.""

Here's a look at look at those three departments, and the challenges they're facing this week.

Louisville police face low morale, lack of community trust

Louisville Metro Police Department Police Chief Erika Shields was in her position less than two weeks before a new report found the department is struggling with low morale and a dearth of trust from its community.

The report was commissioned by the city in the wake of the police killing of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by Louisville police officers executing a no-knock warrant at her apartment in March 2020. The 26-year-old's death fueled protests last summer initially sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Three of the officers involved have been fired, i ncluding two detectives earlier this month . Only one officer was charged in connection with the shooting. He has pleaded not guilty.

Among the findings in the 150-page report was the LMPD's low morale.

Approximately 75% of respondents to an internal survey last summer said they would move to another agency if they had the chance, said Robert Davis, senior vice president of Hillard Heintze, the company hired to conduct the review. And now the department is struggling to recruit and retain new staff.

Shields -- who stepped down as police chief of the Atlanta Police Department after the fatal police shooting of Rayshard Brooks -- said the report was a ""roadmap for us to move our department forward,"" adding, ""we have a lot of work ahead of us.""

Facing the city council Thursday, Shields addressed the lack of community trust, telling council members, ""Breonna Taylor was the flashpoint but there was a lot of distrust leading up to that,"" according to CNN affiliate WLKY

She said repairing the department's relationship with the community will take education, training and a dialogue.

""LMPD cannot engage in enough community events because at some point what is missing is the humanization,"" Shields said, adding, ""and I think that unfortunately the department is not nearly as diverse as it should be.""

Columbus police chief steps down

After the fatal police shooting of a Black man last month, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther this week announced that Columbus Division Police Chief Thomas Quinlan would ""step back"" because he ""could not successfully implement the reform and change"" the mayor wanted.

""Columbus residents have lost faith in him and in Division's ability to change on its own,"" Ginther said in a statement. ""Chief Quinlan understood. He agreed to step back, so the city can move forward.""

Quinlan will remain with the Division of Police as deputy chief, according to the mayor's office.

Ginther said the city's ""commitment to change and reform will not wane"" in the search for Quinlan's replacement, and outlined steps the city would take moving forward, including the appointment of a Civilian Review Board, the selection of an Inspector General and the investment in ""next-generation"" bodycams.

""I remain committed to meaningful, lasting police reform and confronting racism where it exists, advancing social justice so everyone in every neighborhood feels safe.""

In his own statement, Quinlan said that while he hoped to continue in his role, he respected and understood the community's ""need to go in a different direction"" and said he was proud of what the department had accomplished under him.

""In my three decades of service to Columbus, my commitment has never been to any title or position. It has been to this Division and this community I love,"" he said.

Philadelphia police leadership faces scathing report

A report released by Philadelphia's Office of Controller this week criticized city leadership, including Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, for their lack of preparation and handling of protests in the wake of Floyd's death.

Independent investigators hired by the controller's office said in the report that Philadelphia officials failed to adequately plan for the size of the protests. Additionally, understaffing of the police likely led to the use of ""inappropriate force"" by officers, including the deployment of tear gas for the first time since 1985

The editorial board of the Philadelphia Inquirer cited the report in an editorial Wednesday calling for Outlaw's ouster, but she told reporters Thursday she would not step down.

""I want to be clear that the Mayor and other city leaders, including many community leaders, have personally reached out to me and expressed their continued support for me,"" she said. ""I have not been asked to resign, nor will I resign due to the report's findings.""

While the report criticized several city leaders, it faulted Outlaw's decision to leave empty the position of Inspector of Homeland Security since March 2020, a position typically responsible for planning the response to large gatherings and civil unrest, per the controller's office.

Mayor Jim Kenney reiterated his support for Outlaw on Twitter , saying she had his ""full support.""

""No police commissioner in our city's history has handled as many crises on their first six months of the job as she has."""
Federal appeals court allows US border officials to swiftly return unaccompanied migrant children under Trump-era policy,"(CNN) A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the federal government can quickly return unaccompanied migrant children apprehended at the US-Mexico border under a public health order put in place under former President Donald Trump.

The order from the DC Circuit Court means that the government can again begin to expel children who arrived at the US-Mexico border alone, instead of processing them under the usual protocols. Last year, a lower court blocked the administration from turning back unaccompanied migrant children at the southern border. The appeals panel was made up of three Trump appointees.

Friday's decision places additional pressure on the Biden administration, which has condemned Trump-era policies on the US southern border but not yet disclosed how it intends to address the public health order that has given way to the swift removal of thousands of migrants, including asylum seekers.

""This is only a temporary setback,"" said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead lawyer on the case. ""We will continue to litigate this case on behalf of these vulnerable unaccompanied children, who are in need of protection and legally entitled to apply for asylum. But we hope the Biden administration will not make ongoing litigation necessary by rescinding this illegal policy created by the Trump administration.""

Last year, as coronavirus swept across the country, the Trump administration invoked a public health law that allowed for the removal of migrants, including children, apprehended at the border -- a move that raised concerns among officials involved in compiling data who believed it to be driven by political motivations.

"Coronavirus vaccine makes a long, cold journey to rural America","(CNN) The Pfizer/BioNtech coronavirus vaccine completed an arduous journey through development and approval -- but still is left with hundreds of miles to go to reach waiting arms once it arrives in rural America.

""Our couriers travel many, many miles. Our physicians, our staff travel miles,"" said Susan Jarvis, president and CEO of Sanford Health of Northern Minnesota.

The Sanford Health system has more than 400 clinics and senior care locations, many in small towns and isolated farming communities in the upper Midwest.

In Bemidji, Minnesota, the last leg of the vaccine's journey to a number of those communities starts when it's unloaded from its ultra-cold storage and packed into coolers like those you might see at a cookout -- except these have crucial data loggers attached.

""They're under such scrutiny as far as their storage requirements for freezer temperature, refrigeration temperature and they're only good for five days once we pull them out of that ultra-cold freezer,"" said Matt Webb, director of pharmacy at Sanford Health.

A Sanford Health minivan courier makes a 90-mile drive to deliver much-needed vaccine.

""So that data logger is a piece of equipment that monitors the temperature during transport until they get to a refrigerator at their hospital.""

Once the doses are secured and ready to go, the next step is simply getting in a minivan -- and driving. A vaccine delivery trip CNN followed started from Bemidji and ended in a 9,000-person town called Thief River Falls, a little over 90 miles to the northwest.

Data loggers are used to closely monitor the temperature of the fragile vaccine during transport.

""I don't think there was a worry about getting it,"" said Carla Szklarski, an infection preventionist (among a number of other jobs), at Sanford Health Thief River Falls. ""It was more the logistics of how was that going to happen.""

The arrival of the vaccine in rural communities -- for many a light at the end of a very long pandemic tunnel -- involves a major feat of logistics covering huge swaths of sparsely populated country.

President Biden has said he expects the US will be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day ""within the next three weeks or so,"" but in many parts of rural America the barrier to being a part of those vaccinations simply comes down to distance.

""It's nice to play offense for a change,"" Webb said. ""Making sure that we can vaccinate people as close to home as possible is really important.""

Sanford has only five locations that are able to meet the ultra-cold storage requirements for the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine in a coverage area of more than 200,000 square miles across North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota.

The state of Minnesota allotted that the vaccine be distributed only to hospitals -- since they have the required storage capacity.

Sanford's couriers pick up from those five locations and head out.

""It really was a process that was in place that we've been able to tap into and expand so that we can use it for the vaccination delivery and distribution,"" Jarvis said.

But that doesn't mean there aren't roadblocks.

Doses of the vaccine are placed in a refrigerator in Thief River Falls, Minnesota.

In Bagley, a town about 30 miles from Bemidji, some of Sanford's lab-result runs had to be delayed because of conditions on the winter roads. ""The courier routes were canceled because it was blizzard conditions,"" said Stephanie McKnight, administrator of hospital and clinics in Bagley.

""I can't think of a time where we completely didn't have what we needed. There have been times where we've cut it very close.""

Nationwide, rural Americans live an average of more than 10 miles from the nearest hospital. The region that includes this part of Minnesota has a longer average travel time to a hospital than any other part of the country, according to the Pew Research Center

""Distance obviously in northern Minnesota plays a huge role in the ability to get vaccines efficiently, it may also preclude somebody's decision to get a vaccine if we make it difficult to receive it,"" said Alyssa Carlson, pharmacy manager at the Bemidji and Bagley medical centers.

Sanford Health told CNN that as of late January in its Northern Minnesota region, it's been able to get two doses of the vaccine to more than 1,000 staff members as part of the 1a group and at least the first dose for hundreds of 65 and older patients as part of the next phase of distribution. The system says it's now sharing storage resources with the local county public health department in Bemidji as part of getting shots in arms as quickly as possible.

'Everybody knows everybody'

""In a rural community, we tend to know who our patients are before they become patients,"" said Dr. Colleen Swank, vice president of clinics for Sanford Health of Northern Minnesota.

""It's not the 75-year-old man in bed with Covid, it's Mr. Smith, my neighbor's dad.""

Thief River Falls, about 70 miles from the Canadian border, initially thought it had avoided the pandemic -- until it found it hadn't. Health care staff told CNN that at one point, most of their in-patients were Covid-19 patients in a town where ""everybody knows everybody.""

""I went home and cried that first night I had to tell somebody they couldn't come to visit,"" Szklarski said.

""We've always thought that, you know, nobody dies alone. The family is a huge part of their care, their emotional and physical well-being, and then not being able to have them here has been the hardest thing.""

Doses of the Pfizer vaccine arrive in Thief River Falls after a long drive.

She described these patients as being like members of her own family, which made the pain of the pandemic that much more difficult, ""to go to practically a family member and tell them, I'm sorry you can't come in and see your mother.""

Szklarski, like so many others, looks to this vaccine as a source of hope, especially on account of her dual families, the one that includes her relatives -- and the one that includes her patients.

""I think it's something in the past we've really taken for granted, you know? To walk into the hospital and visit our loved ones. And we can't do that anymore,"" she said."
These young Covid widows are grieving during lockdown through a Facebook group,"(CNN) When Pamela Addison's husband died from Covid-19 last April at age 44, she felt completely alone. She didn't know anyone her age who'd lost someone to Covid, and she hadn't seen stories about people as young as her husband, Martin, dying from the virus.

That was, at least, until she opened a sympathy card from a woman she had never met.

""You are not alone,"" the card began.

""And at that moment, the weight of feeling alone was lifted, because now there was someone else who understood,"" Addison told CNN's Poppy Harlow.

The note was from Kristina Scorpo, a New Jersey mother of two young boys who lost her own husband, Frank, to Covid weeks earlier. Frank, a police officer who had just achieved his dream of becoming a motorcycle cop, was just 34.

Frank and Kristina Scorpo pose with their sons Francesco, left, and Santino.

After Frank died, Kristina received a similar letter from an acquaintance who was also a widow. Inside was a blank card. The woman asked that when Kristina was ready, she send a similar note to someone else who needed comfort -- even if she didn't know them.

Scorpo read about Addison's loss on Facebook and realized they had children of similar ages and didn't live far from one another. Addison's son, Graeme, is 1 and her daughter, Elsie, is 2 1/2. Scorpo's sons, Francesco and Santino, are 5 and 1 1/2.

""So I took the card out of the drawer and I said, 'That's it. I'm going to sit at the kitchen table, right where I'm at, and I'm going to write the card and I'm going to send it to her because she knows exactly how I feel and I know exactly how she feels.'""

It turned out, she was right. The two soon started speaking on the phone.

""Every time I needed someone who understood what I was going through, I would check in with her, see how she was doing, too,"" Addison said. ""And she gave me some hope, because she's like, 'Yeah, I'm having a really good day.' So if I was having a bad day, (I'd think), 'OK, good days are ahead of me.'""

Martin and Pamela Addison smile with their children Elsie, left, and Graeme.

Addison said she wanted to return the favor and write letters to other young Covid widows and widowers, but she was overwhelmed by the number of other young adults who had lost spouses. Then it dawned on her: Why not start a Facebook group where they could all comfort each other and create a community?

That was the start of the "" Young Widows and Widowers of Covid-19 "" group on Facebook. Addison asked Scorpo to be an administrator of the group with her, and they soon had dozens of members. Today, there are 209 widows and widowers in the group -- all members of a club that no one wanted to be a part of.

Diana Ordonez soon joined them. She lost her husband, Juan -- a man she calls the other half of her soul -- when he was just 40. Their daughter, Mia, is 5.

Juan and Diana Ordonez hold their daughter, Mia.

Ordonez downsized after her husband died, moving to an apartment in Waldwick, New Jersey -- the same town as Addison. Ordonez found the Facebook group through Addison's posting in the town's moms Facebook group.

""It's nine months later and it's still hard, because (when) something good happens ... there's this empty silence where his words would once be,"" Ordonez said.

For her daughter, Mia, it has meant sleepless nights with the fear she may lose her mother, too. Juan was taken to the hospital in the middle of the night and never returned.

Addison and Ordonez now text each other most days. They have formed a much-needed support system among women who actually understand what they're going through, and they no longer feel so alone.

The grieving process has made more difficult because of the social isolation required by the continuing pandemic.

Leslie left behind his wife, Whitney, and their two children: 9-year-old Zuri and 1-year-old Chance.

""After they pass, you can't be around anybody, right? And now you have to be alone,"" Ordonez said. That made the Facebook group all the more meaningful.

Whitney Parker found the group at the start of the new year, after she set a resolution to focus on healing in 2021. Her husband, Leslie Lamar Parker, died from Covid-19 and left behind the couple's two children: Zuri, now 9, and Chance, who turned 1 just days after his father died.

""The group is better than any therapy session I've ever had,"" Parker said.

The group is especially helpful, she said, because it's focused on young adults who died from Covid -- a smaller group of victims, though larger than originally thought.

Leslie Lamar Parker holds his son, Chance.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 8,474 adults between 25 and 44 have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic began.

""When you lose someone that's so important to your everyday life, you're just like, why?"" Parker said. ""Why did this happen? He had so much more life, so much more time.""

It's a common refrain among these women, grappling with the idea of the rest of their lives without their partners -- the fathers of their children.

""I know that Martin would want me to be happy and live my life,"" Addison told the other women. ""I think about that every day with the kids. And when we're doing something, I will just remember that this is what he wanted. If they're running in the huge yard that our house has, that was what he envisioned when we bought this house ... and that gives me happiness because it's coming true, but of course, that's also heartbreaking.""

It's a bond that was formed in an unlikely way. For now, the women comfort each other through the screens of their computers as they wait for the day they can hug each other in person.

""At least our kids have each other one day,"" Addison said. ""So that's a nice bonus from this: knowing that (our) kids are going to meet. ... They'll have each other there and they'll understand exactly what they went through."""
Putin signs law extending nuclear arms treaty between US and Russia,"Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on Friday ratifying the extension of New START, a key arms control treaty with the United States, a week before it was due to expire, the Kremlin said in a statement.

The nuclear arms control agreement has been extended for five years until February 5, 2026, the Kremlin said. It is the last major pact of its kind between Russia and the US after the US pulled out of a separate nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), under the Trump administration in 2019

Putin and US President Joe Biden spoke on the phone on Tuesday expressing ""satisfaction"" over the exchange of diplomatic notes between both countries on extending the treaty. The Russian Parliament voted to ratify the five-year extension on Wednesday.

The landmark treaty was first signed for a period of 10 years by former US President Barack Obama and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2010. It took effect on February 5, 2011.

NY judge orders Trump Organization's tax firm to hand over more documents to state attorney general,"(CNN) A New York state judge on Friday ordered a tax firm that has worked with former President Donald Trump to turn over more documents to New York Attorney General Letitia James as part of her office's investigation into the Trump Organization.

The supplemental order is one of several that Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron has made in the past month requesting that the tax firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius turn over documents that James's office has requested as part of its investigation.

The attorney general's office declined to comment. CNN has reached out to the Trump Organization and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius for comment.

The Trump Organization has previously argued that the documents are protected by attorney-client privilege, but in December , Engoron ruled that ""some but all"" of the documents requested by the attorney general's office were privileged.

Engoron wrote that he privately reviewed documents that Trump's tax attorney Sheri Dillon at Morgan Lewis & Bockius has to turn over, saying that documents he determined were not privileged be turned over by February 4.

"John Chaney, basketball Hall of Famer who coached at Temple, dies at 89","(CNN) Famed former Temple University men's basketball coach John Chaney passed away at the age of 89 on Friday. Temple confirmed Chaney died after a short illness.

Chaney led the Temple Owls for 24 seasons and to 17 NCAA postseason tournament appearances, making it as far as the Elite Eight on five occasions.

Chaney won 516 games from 1982-2006 with the Owls, a school record, and counting his time at Division II Cheyney University, he had more than 700 NCAA victories.

He was a two-time national men's coach of the year as voted by the basketball writers' association.

Temple University head coach John Chaney Chaney celebrated his 500th victory at Temple with a 69-37 win over Army on November 15, 2005.

""John Chaney was a great coach, but he was so much more. For generations of Temple University students, he was a wise counselor, a dedicated teacher, an icon of success, and a passionate leader who always led by example and with conviction,"" said Temple President Richard M. Englert.

A Georgia city is replacing a Confederate monument with a statue of civil rights hero John Lewis,"(CNN) For 112 years, a 30-foot obelisk stood outside the courthouse grounds in the suburban Atlanta city of Decatur.

Erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, it suggested the Civil War was about state's rights and ""Southern honor"" instead of the real root cause: slavery.

That structure was finally taken down last year. And in its place, officials now plan to erect a monument that honors the late John Lewis, a man who spent his entire life fighting for civil rights

It is the latest chapter in a years-long battle the city has waged to rid itself of this symbol in its town square; a symbol it considered a dark legacy of slavery.

Decatur is a liberal enclave in a predominantly African American county, DeKalb.

But it also lies in a state that, in 2019, passed a law protecting Confederate monuments -- saying they honored history and heritage.

First came the plaque

Hamstrung by state law, DeKalb County officials first installed a bronze plaque next to the obelisk to counter the narrative it pushed. The 184-word statement didn't mince words.

The monument, it said, ""bolstered white supremacy and faulty history.""

""This monument and similar ones also were created to intimidate African Americans,"" it added.

That's how things stayed -- until last year when, compelled by the killing of George Floyd , America took a long, hard look at race and injustice.

Then came the removal

As protests rocked the nation, Decatur argued the monument had become a threat to public safety . A judge agreed.

""The Confederate obelisk has become an increasingly frequent target of graffiti and vandalism, a figurative lightning rod for friction among citizens, and a potential catastrophe that could happen at any time if individuals attempt to forcibly remove or destroy it,"" Judge Clarence Seeliger said in a ruling last June.

The point of the removal is not to prevent its public display but ""instead is an appropriate measure to abate a public nuisance and protect the obelisk,"" he added.

He ordered it removed and placed in storage until further notice.

Days later, a large crane pulled down the obelisk as those gathered chanted, ""Take it down! Take it down!"" Others applauded.

Next comes the tribute

This week, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved a resolution to honor Lewis with a monument outside the courthouse where the obelisk stood.

Lewis, a towering figure of the civil rights movement and a longtime US congressman, died last July after a six-month battle with cancer.

""John was a giant of a man, with a humble heart,"" Commissioner Davis Johnson said in a statement. ""He met no strangers and he truly was a man who loved the people and who loved his country which he represented very well.

""He deserves this honor.""

Details about the memorial's design and installation have not been announced."
Biden seeks to intensify public lobbying for Covid-19 relief bill amid the pandemic,"(CNN) When President Joe Biden intensifies his attention next week to selling Republicans and Democrats on his coronavirus relief bill , he won't be relying on some of the presidency's most symbolic powers.

Out, for now, are arm-twisting sessions in the Oval Office or rides into a lawmaker's district aboard Air Force One. Instead, administration aides are planning remote television hits from the White House, out-of-the-blue phone calls to skeptical Republicans and maybe a stop somewhere within driving distance, according to officials.

Hamstrung by the very pandemic he is working to contain, Biden and his advisers have sharply limited the ways in which he can promote the $1.9 trillion relief bill he has proposed in the opening days of his presidency. Flying around the country to sell the plan is off the table for now, aides said, as Biden works to promote responsible pandemic behavior. Even the idea of visiting the weekly Democratic and Republican Senate luncheons on Capitol Hill is a non-starter, aides said, though -- like Biden -- many members of Congress have been vaccinated.

It's not necessarily how Biden would like to be ushering his debut legislative attempt through Congress, particularly since he built an entire career as a senator around attempts to foster bipartisanship through camaraderie on Capitol Hill. So, too, will his famous personal touch with middle-class Americans be sidelined as Air Force One remains in the hangar at Joint Base Andrews. He and his then-boss President Barack Obama used both while mustering support for the 2009 stimulus plan in the earliest days of that administration.

""The irony is that the virus is the core challenge he is trying to address,"" David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the Obama administration during its economic stimulus push, said Friday. ""It also limits his ability to travel and sell it.""

There is no greater measure of success for the first chapter of the Biden administration than the outcome of his ""American Rescue Plan."" If passed with Republican support it could provide a boon to Biden's visions of ""unity,"" the vague but aspirational motto of his administration.

That's left Biden's aides scrambling for ways to use the bully pulpit in the time of a pandemic.

""It is vital for the President and the vice president and every member of our team to be speaking directly to the American people, and so we're looking for creative ways to do that,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday.

So far that has amounted to telephone calls from Biden to on-the-fence lawmakers, some remote interviews with the vice president in the home television markets of moderate Democrats and outreach to governors desperate for more financial assistance.

""He called me out of the blue,"" Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said on Thursday. ""We had a very friendly, good conversation. We talked briefly about the Covid bill, but it was mainly just a friendly chat.""

Biden's events during his first week in office have all looked remarkably similar: most have occurred in the State Dining Room, with a portrait of Abraham Lincoln and a fireplace mantle as the backdrop, while Biden reads a speech about that day's executive actions. When he made a pitch for the relief package on Friday, he was joined by his own vice president and Treasury Secretary, not skeptical Republicans.

White House officials have begun surveying options for events at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that would allow Biden to highlight provisions in the bill, and have explored venues in the Washington area that would still get him out of the White House to market his plan, according to White House officials.

Remote camera set-ups have also been tested in various White House rooms, officials said, including the Library on the basement level, for Biden to make his pitch on television without having to leave the building.

Still, the White House is taking coronavirus precautions remarkably seriously, which could complicate selling Biden's agenda. While Democratic officials on Capitol Hill say the discipline is a welcome change from the Trump administration, which all but ignored the virus, they do question whether it has hampered the Biden team.

""The coronavirus pandemic has paralyzed some of their outreach efforts,"" one top Democrat said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the Biden administration.

No travel -- for now

Though the President has received two doses of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine, as have his vice president and most top White House officials, he will remain grounded in Washington to demonstrate recommended safety measures preventing the spread of the virus, according to White House aides.

Officials acknowledge privately there are ways for the President and Vice President Kamala Harris to travel safely, just as they did during the final stretch of last year's campaign. But for now, advisers believe that keeping them off airplanes and close to Washington is better in order to model the behaviors health experts recommend to prevent contagion.

One official noted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to warn against travel, though plenty of Americans continue to pass through airports on a daily basis. Another White House aide likened the decision not to travel to the President wearing a mask in public.

""He is modeling good behavior, unlike Trump,"" one official said.

Biden and Harris could venture into communities around Washington that would not require flying, another official said, hoping to make the case for the Covid relief package in communities that still desperately need government help.

But final details haven't been worked out. And in listing Biden's schedule for next week, Psaki made no mention on Friday of trips outside of Washington.

""Certainly his preference would be to get on a plane and fly around the country, but that's not the step we're planning currently,"" she said.

In lieu of travel, top administration officials have turned to the airwaves -- participating in more than 60 national TV interviews in the last week to pitch the coronavirus relief package, on top of dozens more local TV interviews, a White House official said.

Harris did a handful of local news interviews in Arizona and West Virginia; White House communications director Kate Bedingfield took her pitch to ""The View"" on Friday; and Cedric Richmond, the White House's public engagement director, has also made the rounds.

The White House is also working to drum up support among key local officials, including a bipartisan group of mayors in Florida who plan to pen an op-ed in support of Biden's relief bill.

""We are going to leave everything on the field -- Covid or not,"" a White House official said.

Different times

US Vice President Joe Biden stands with US President Barack Obama as he signs the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science in Denver, Colorado, on February 17, 2009.

It's a far cry from 12 years ago, when Obama and Biden hit the road to build public support for the economic stimulus plan -- or opened the doors of the White House theater to watch the Super Bowl with a bipartisan congressional contingent.

Biden himself touted the plan on the crumbling Route 34 bridge spanning the Conodoguinet Creek outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a few weeks before its eventual passage.

""In the end of the day, this debate is not about Washington. It's about you,"" he said afterward. ""It's about Pennsylvania, Delaware, California, Montana. It's about people out there who played by the rules, done almost everything right, are being swamped by an economy that is -- there's nothing much they can do about it.""

When Biden and Obama touted the bill's success at an event in Denver, the President praised his deputy's work ""behind the scenes"" to get it passed.

This time around, most of Biden's work cajoling members of Congress occur remotely. Biden has spoken to a number of Republican and Democratic lawmakers over the phone since taking office, but has not yet invited any to the White House.

In a private Senate GOP conference call Wednesday, several key Republican senators -- including Collins and Rob Portman of Ohio -- expressed concern with the direction of the relief plan and questioned whether Biden's team was serious about a bipartisan deal, according to two people familiar with the call.

Biden spoke with both Collins and Portman on the phone, and has communicated with other Republicans. He said Friday he'd like to pass the measure with Republican support but that time was of the essence.

""I support passing Covid relief with support from Republicans if we can get it. But the Covid relief has to pass,"" he told reporters on the White House South Lawn. ""There's no ifs, ands or buts."""
"Pregnant women should get Covid-19 vaccine, US doctors say, despite conflicting international advice","(CNN) If you're pregnant during the pandemic, major medical groups in the United States have a clear message for you -- please consider being vaccinated against Covid-19.

""US regulatory bodies and medical experts have clearly stated that all eligible pregnant individuals should have the choice to receive the vaccine,"" said Dr. Christopher Zahn, vice president of practice activities for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

""There's really no theoretical reason to believe it's going to cause harm to either the mother, or her unborn child and we're very confident it's going to provide considerable benefits to both the mother and the baby,"" said Dr. Richard Beigi, who sits on ACOG's Immunization, Infectious Disease, and Public Health Preparedness Expert Work Group

Only a few people, such as those with severe allergies, a history of anaphylactic shock or who are suffering from advanced cancer would likely be advised to avoid the vaccine. Any pregnant woman with concerns should speak to her OB-GYN, experts say.

An international controversy

It's a strong, clear message, one that OB-GYNs and medical associations hope will reach pregnant women and their families who may be confused about conflicting recommendations put out this week by the World Health Organization.

On Tuesday, WHO recommended against using the Moderna vaccine during pregnancy ""unless the benefit of vaccinating a pregnant woman outweighs the potential vaccine risks,"" such as in health workers and ""pregnant women with comorbidities"" who are at high risk for developing a severe case of Covid-19.

The international health agency had also recommended against using the Pfizer vaccine during pregnancy in January, pointing in both cases to a lack of safety data on pregnant women who were excluded from original vaccine trials.

""Due to insufficient data, WHO does not recommend the vaccination of pregnant women at this time,"" the Pfizer page states.

But any ""potential vaccine risks"" mentioned by WHO are purely speculative, doctors tell CNN, compared to the known risks of Covid-19 for both pregnant women and their babies.

for pregnant women include serious reactions, even death, and an increased risk of preterm delivery for their babies, The risks of Covid-19 infectionfor pregnant women include serious reactions, even death, and an increased risk of preterm delivery for their babies, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

""The absence of data is not equivalent to risk of harm — especially when the science and basic biology does not suggest a plausible reason why harm could occur,"" said Dr. Kjersti Aagaard, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Texas Children's Hospital and Meyer professor chair in obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine.

Doctors who spoke to CNN said there are decades of safety data showing no harm to a pregnant woman or her baby from inactivated vaccines -- and they believe that data should also apply to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which are not made from a live virus.

Syringes are filled with the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

Instead, they are mRNA vaccines, which teach the body's cells how to make a piece of a protein that triggers an immune response. As soon as the instructions are delivered, ""the cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA,"" according to the CDC.

Therefore, the WHO concerns are ""focused more on the hypothetical risks at the expense of recognizing the clear benefits of immunization,"" Beigi said. ""This can be very confusing for a woman, which is unfortunate, very unfortunate.""

The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine joined ACOG in putting out a strongly worded rebuttal of the WHO's stance

Covid-19 risks during pregnancy are significant

At the beginning of the pandemic, it didn't appear Covid-19 adversely affected women or their babies during pregnancy. As the data rolled in, however, that belief changed dramatically.

""Pregnant women are up to five times more likely to be hospitalized, three to four times more likely to need to receive care in an ICU, and two to three times more likely to require life saving measures, like getting a breathing tube or being put on advanced life support,"" said Aagaard, who has a doctorate in immunology.

""And while the data is not yet complete, there's at least a small risk of maternal death and stillbirth and preterm birth with Covid-19 disease during pregnancy,"" Aagaard continued. ""Black and Latino women have an especially increased risk of severe disease and death from Covid-19. Those are the facts.""

Why would pregnancy put women at greater risk? One reason is a decreased lung capacity for the woman as the baby grows.

""You can develop respiratory compromise, to the extent that you can't recover from it,"" Aagaard said. ""For every pandemic we've had in the last 100 years, there's been an increased risk for pregnant women when those pandemics are associated with severe respiratory disease.""

In addition, Aagaard said, a pregnant woman's heart pumps 1.5 times harder than it would normally to provide adequate blood for the baby and the placenta.

""So that overaction of the heart, which we call a higher cardiac output, also renders pregnant women at risk from having heart failure problems, which can be a manifestation and potential cause of death from Covid-19 disease,"" she said.

Pregnant women may also be more likely to have an overenthusiastic immune system, which can lead to the so-called cytokine storm that signals more severe disease and negative outcomes, Aagaard said.

And finally, there is an increased likelihood of blood clotting during pregnancy, which Covid-19 is known to make worse.

""Humans, like all placental mammals, run the risk of bleeding to death after that placenta separates off the wall of the uterus,"" Aagaard said. ""So 4½ million years of evolution is at our backs, helping us clot a little bit more effectively when we're pregnant.""

Benefits for baby?

expectant mom, new data has found there may also be significant advantages for her baby. Research Putting aside the obvious protective benefits of vaccination for anexpectant mom, new data has found there may also be significant advantages for her baby. Research released Friday in JAMA Pediatrics found mothers with both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of Covid-19 passed antibodies to the virus to their newborns via the placenta.

Further studies will have to be done to assure such antibodies can protect newborns from infection and for how long, but the findings are ""reassuring,"" said Dr. Flor Munoz, an associate professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, in an accompanying editorial

While that study did not examine whether antibodies created by vaccination would also cross the placenta, the concept has been used in maternal medicine for some time.

Pregnant women are given both inactivated flu vaccine and one called TDAP, which protects both mom and baby from tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, also known as whooping cough.

""Wouldn't that be awesome if we could so beautifully transition our developing fetus to come out into the world protected from Covid-19?"" Aagaard said. ""If we could arm that baby with its own memory cells that would be a twofer, which is what we always are hoping for.""

A different emphasis

While both US and WHO officials are clear about the lack of safety data in their guidelines, a WHO spokesperson told CNN on Friday morning that the agency is placing more emphasis on ""guidance that can inform immunization programme decisions"" during ""current limitations on global vaccine supply."" The CDC and US position is focused on ""individual decision-making.""

""As data are lacking on the presence or absence of vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy, at this time WHO could not provide a broad recommendation for vaccination of pregnant women, except among those who fall into the highest priority groups for whom vaccination is now recommended in countries,"" the spokesperson told CNN via email.

""I think the fact that they're saying we don't recommend it will have an effect across many countries,"" said ACOG's Beigi, ""in that the medical leaders of those countries are going to be much more reluctant.""

Zahn, also of ACOG, agreed.

""We are concerned that the conflicting recommendations will undermine the confidence of all patients considering this potentially life-saving vaccine,"" Zahn said. ""We strongly encourage vaccination programs to follow the guidance of US health authorities and medical experts so that pregnant individuals do not face barriers to vaccination.""

Trials of various sizes are currently underway, and doctors point to the scores of pregnant women who have gotten Covid-19 vaccines since they began rolling out -- with no known side effects. That makes good sense, said Texas Children's Aagaard.

""Not only have I been in obstetrics for a couple of decades, but my PhD is in immunology,"" Aagaard said. ""And I really can't come up with what the biology or science would be as to why a pregnant woman or her fetus would be at any greater risk than a non-pregnant woman.""

While appreciating the ""nuance"" the WHO is using to prioritize, Aagaard said she remains confident in ""our capacity to walk and chew gum at the same time.""

""We are fully capable of vaccinating all those in need, inclusive of all of those at highest risk of harm. This includes pregnant women, which represents approximately 3% to 5% of the world's female population at any given time,"" Aagaard said.

Update: Late Friday, WHO Late Friday, WHO changed the language on the Moderna page . Instead of recommending against the vaccine for pregnant women, the agency now says:

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""Nevertheless, based on what we know about this kind of vaccine, we don't have any specific reason to believe there will be specific risks that would outweigh the benefits of vaccination for pregnant women.""

However, the agency continues to only recommend the Moderna vaccine for two groups: ""Pregnant women at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. health workers) or who have comorbidities which add to their risk of severe disease, may be vaccinated in consultation with their health care provider.

No change was made to WHO recommendations on the Pfizer vaccine page. It continues to say : ""Due to insufficient data, WHO does not recommend the vaccination of pregnant women at this time.""

The agency only recommends the the Pfizer vaccine for one group:

""In case a pregnant woman has an unavoidable risk high of exposure (e.g. a health worker), vaccination may be considered in discussion with their healthcare provider,"" the WHO says."
Cicely Tyson was an early champion of Black beauty,"Allyssia Alleyne , CNN Written by

Cicely Tyson, the award-winning, trailblazing African American actor, died on Thursday, at the age of 96. Over her lifetime, she became an icon, known for personifying layered and complex Black women on the screen and the stage, notably starring as the wife of a jailed sharecropper family in 1972's ""Sounder,"" for which she earned her first Oscar nomination; and as a former slave in ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" in 1974, for which she won two Emmy awards, among other performances. But her impact extended well beyond her choice of roles.

Off screen, Tyson was an enduring picture of style, a star who loved fashion and indulged in beauty until the very end, known for her endless rotation of glamorous gowns and hats, and ever-changing hairstyles. And for Black women in particular, she provided something to aspire to -- though her decisions often divided opinions.

Early in her career, she caused a stir when she became one of the first successful Black actresses to wear hair in an afro. But her intent, she maintained, had more to do with a performance than her politics.

The night before she was meant to film an episode of a TV show where she was playing an African woman, she walked into a Harlem barbershop and instructed the barber to ""cut my hair very short and then shampoo it, so that it would go back to its natural shape,"" she recalled on an episode of Oprah's Masterclass in 2014, feeling that her straightened hair wasn't true to the character.

The true weight of that decision became clear in 1963, when she joined the cast of the CBS series ""Eastside/Westside"" -- becoming the first Black woman actor to be given a recurring TV spot -- with hair still shorn short.

""Black women would come up to me and say I was in a position to project a beautiful black image. Instead I was distorting the image, that my hairstyle was embarrassing and humiliating to black women. I also began to get a lot of letters from hairdressers all over the country complaining that they were losing business because I was wearing my hair natural on television,"" Tyson told the Boston Globe in a 1972 interview.

However, she was undaunted by her detractors: ""They'd been brainwashed into believing that all things relating to physical blackness were bad, negative, less than good and less than white. But I knew it was just a question of time before the whole picture took on its true colors.""

Later, in the early '70s, she flexed her influence once again, this time wearing cornrows while promoting the movie ""Sounder"" in 1972, and appearing on Jet magazine's March 1973 cover with the style, helping to usher in a new vogue for braided styles among Black American women.

But perhaps her most significant beauty influence came from simply being comfortable and successful in her own dark skin -- on screen, on stage, and on the covers of Jet, Essence and Ebony -- was an unintentional, yet, powerful statement in a colorist world that values lightness and whiteness above all else; a quiet declaration that Black is beautiful.

""You made me feel loved and seen and valued in a world where there is still a cloak of invisibility for us dark chocolate girls,"" actress Viola Davis, who played Tyson's daughter on ""How To Get Away With Murder,"" posted on social media. ""You gave me permission to dream....because it was only in my dreams that I could see the possibilities in myself."""
2 charts that show just how old this Congress actually is,"(CNN) When Patrick Leahy was briefly transported to the hospital Tuesday night -- just hours after he had been sworn in to preside over the pending impeachment trial of ex-President Donald Trump -- every story on the news noted that the Vermont Democratic senator was 80 years old.

Which, surely you would think, makes him the senior statesman in the Senate. Right?

Not by a long shot. There are actually four senators older than Leahy in the chamber, including Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dianne Feinstein (D-California) who are both 87 years old. (Feinstein was elected to a fifth full term in 2018 although she has, of late, faced questions about her mental fitness for the job. Grassley remains undecided as to whether he will run for an eighth term next November.)

And it doesn't stop there! There are 21 senators between 70 and 80 -- including Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vermont) who turns 80 this fall, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) who turns 79 next month.

50% of the Senate is 65 years old or older, and more than half of Republican senators (54%) are 65 or older. In fact, according to calculations made by CNN's Janie Boschma and Christopher Hickey of the Senate is 65 years old or older, and more than half of Republican senators (54%) are 65 or older.

"Pentagon close to reaching agreement to provide around 450,000 Covid-19 vaccinations a day if they're available","(CNN) The Pentagon and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are negotiating the final terms of an agreement that could see the military provide around 450,000 Covid-19 vaccinations a day.

The figure is included in a draft agreement between the two agencies viewed by CNN that also calls for the deployment of 10,000 troops at 100 vaccination centers across the United States that would run through at least February 26 as a start.

As it stands, the Pentagon would not provide additional vaccine doses so the plan seems to be dependent on the amount of vaccines supplied to each state being increased.

On Tuesday President Joe Biden announced an increase in the weekly vaccine supply to states, tribes and territories -- upping the current 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses weekly.

Several officials emphasize details of the agreement are still being worked out and could change before final approval for the deployment is given by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

"Covid vaccine race leaves behind lonely, older adults","(KHN) A divide between ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" is emerging as older adults across the country struggle to get covid-19 vaccines.

Seniors with family members or friends to help them are getting vaccine appointments, even if it takes days to secure them. Those without reliable social supports are missing out.

Elders who can drive — or who can get other people to drive them — are traveling to locations where vaccines are available, crossing city or county borders to do so. Those without private transportation, are stuck with whatever is available nearby.

Older adults who are comfortable with computers and have internet service are getting notices of vaccine availability and can register online for appointments. Those who can't afford broadband services or don't use computers or smartphone apps are likely missing out on information about vaccines and appointments.

The extent of this phenomenon has not been documented yet. But experts are discussing it on various forums, as are older adults and family members.

""I'm very concerned that barriers to getting vaccines are having unequal impact on our older population,"" said Dr. XinQi Dong, director of the Institute for Health, Health Policy and Aging Research at Rutgers University.

Disproportionately, these barriers appear to be affecting Blacks and Hispanic elders as well as people who are not native English speakers; older adults living in low-income neighborhoods; seniors who are frail, seriously ill or homebound; and those with vision and hearing impairments.

""The question is 'Who's going to actually get vaccines?' — older adults who are tech-savvy, with financial resources and family members to help them, or harder-to-reach populations?"" said Abraham ""Ab"" Brody, an associate professor of nursing and medicine at New York University.

""If seniors of color and people living in poor neighborhoods can't find a way to get vaccines, you're going to see disparities that have surfaced during the pandemic widening,"" he said.

Preliminary evidence from an analysis by KHN indicates this appears to be happening. In 23 states reporting vaccine data by race, Blacks are being vaccinated at a far lower rate than whites, based on their share of the population. The data on Hispanics suggests similar disparities but is incomplete.

Although the data is not age-adjusted, Black and Hispanic seniors have been far more likely to become seriously ill and die from covid than white seniors during the pandemic, other evidence shows

Myrna Hart, 79, who has diabetes and high blood pressure and lives in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, a southern suburb of St. Paul, is afraid she'll be left behind during the vaccine rollout. Hart, who is Black, is eager to get a shot, but she can't travel to two large vaccination sites for seniors in Minneapolis' northern suburbs, more than 30 miles away.

Myrna Hart is afraid she'll be left behind during the vaccine rollout.

""That's too far for me to drive; I don't know my way, and I could get lost,"" she said. ""If they have a handful of people who look like me in those places, I would be surprised. I wouldn't feel safe going there by myself.""

Family members can't give her a ride. Hart's husband is in a skilled nursing facility, receiving rehabilitation after having a leg amputated due to diabetes. Her son is in the hospital, with complications from kidney disease. A daughter lives in Westchester County, New York.

So far, Hart has had no success getting an appointment online at smaller, closer vaccine locations.

""I don't know how much I can endure this,"" she said, her voice breaking, as she described her fear of catching Covid and her frustration. ""I'm afraid they're going to run out [of vaccine] before they get to people my age, now that they've changed the plan to include 65-year-olds who are jumping ahead of us.""(Like many states, Minnesota widened eligibility to people 65 and older in mid-January, following recommendations from the federal government.)

Although Hart, a former accountant and bookstore owner, knows her way around computers, many older adults don't.

According to a new survey by University of Michigan researchers, nearly 50% of Black seniors and 53% of Hispanic older adults did not have online ""patient portal"" accounts with their health care providers as of June 2020, compared with 39% of White elders.

What's more, a significant portion of Black and Hispanic older adults lack internet access — 25% and 21%, respectively, according to the Census Bureau.

""It's not enough to offer technological solutions to these seniors: They need someone — an adult child, a grandchild, an advocate — who can help them engage with the health care system and get these vaccines,"" said Dr. Preeti Malani, director of the University of Michigan's National Poll on Healthy Aging.

In Birmingham, Alabama, Dr. Anand Iyer, a pulmonologist who specializes in caring for older adults, runs a clinic for more than 200 indigent patients with various types of chronic lung disease — conditions that put them at risk of becoming seriously ill if they're infected with coronavirus. Seventy percent of his patients are Black, and many are elderly.

""I would estimate 10% to 20% are at risk of missing out on vaccines because they're homebound, live alone, don't have transportation or lack reliable social connections,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, those are the same factors that put them at risk of poor outcomes from covid.""

Every week, he gets a call from a 90-year-old Black patient who lives alone in Tuskegee with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, cancer and severe arthritis. ""She's old, but she's resilient and she keeps me posted on what's going on,"" Iyer said.

To the doctor's knowledge, this patient doesn't have children, other family members or friends to help her; instead, she relies on a handyman who comes around every so often. ""How in the world is she supposed to get the vaccine?"" he wondered.

Kei Hoshino Quigley, 42, of New York City, knows that her parents — Japanese American immigrants, who have lived with her since last March — couldn't have managed without her help.

Although Quigley's 70-year-old father and 80-year-old mother speak English, they have heavy accents and ""it can be very hard for people to understand them,"" she said.

In addition, Quigley's father doesn't know how to use computers, and her mother's eyesight isn't good. ""For older people who don't speak English as their native language and who are intimidated by the computer, the systems that have been set up are just nuts,"" Quigley said.

Knowing they couldn't navigate vaccine registration systems on their own, Quigley spent hours online trying to secure appointments for her parents.

After encountering a host of problems — frequent error messages, information she inputted suddenly getting wiped out on vaccine registration sites, calendars with disappearing-by-the-second appointments, incorrect notices that her parents didn't qualify — Quigley arranged for her mother to be vaccinated in mid-January and for her father to get his first shot a few weeks later.

Language issues are also a significant hurdle for older Hispanics, who ""are not being offered information on vaccines in a way they understand or in Spanish,"" said Yanira Cruz, president and chief executive officer of the National Hispanic Council on Aging.

""I'm very concerned that older adults who are not fluent in English, who don't have a family member to help them navigate online, and who don't have access to private transportation are going to be left out"" during this rollout, she said.

None of the older adults living in two low-income housing complexes run by her organization in Washington, D.C., and Garden City, Kansas, have received vaccines, Cruz said. ""We should be bringing the vaccines to where seniors live, not asking them to take a bus, expose themselves to other people, and try to find their way to a clinic,"" she said.

Nothing can substitute for a friend or family member determined to make sure an older loved one is protected against covid. Joanna Stolove has played that role for her father, 82, who is blind and has congestive heart failure, and her mother, 74, who has Lewy body dementia.

The couple lives in Nassau County on New York's Long Island and receives 40 hours of care at home each week.

Stolove, a geriatric social worker, took time during work to try to get her father an appointment, but many people don't have that luxury. She works at a naturally occurring retirement community in Morningside Heights, a diverse neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

With substantial effort, Stolove secured an appointment for her father at a large drive-in vaccine site on Jones Beach on Jan. 26; her sister found an appointment for her mother there in late February. At work, where many of her clients live alone and don't have family members or friends whom they can rely on for help, she counsels them about vaccines and tries to find appointments on their behalf.

""I have so many advantages in assisting my parents,"" Stolove said. ""Without help from someone like me, how can people find their way through this?"""
First responders describe chaos at US Capitol riot,"(CNN) Two members of the Arlington County Police Department's Civil Disturbance Unit provided a debriefing memo, obtained by CNN, that details their experience during harrowing moments of being the only medical assets on the scene for all law enforcement agencies during the US Capitol riots.

The memo describes how Lt. Ned Waterfall and public information officer Taylor Blunt treated badly beaten police officers and even attempted to aid protesters, but because of the hundreds of people that crowded the Capitol steps, they said they were unable to reach those who died.

Waterfall and Blunt were among a team of Arlington County law enforcement deployed to Washington, DC, on January 5 and January 6 in preparation for ""on-going development of intelligence ... and the potential for violence,"" according to a letter written on January 4 by Metropolitan Police Department's Acting Chief of Police Robert J. Contee, III.

The memo says the duo arrived at the US Capitol around 3:30 p.m. on January 6 after shots were fired inside the building. The members of CDU joined officers with DC's Metropolitan Police Department to execute a plan to move the crowd away from the Capitol.

""We were among the first mutual aid teams to arrive and were critical to begin the process of driving protesters off the Capitol,"" Blunt wrote on January 7 in a letter obtained by CNN through open records.

Judge likely to extend hold on Biden's deportation pause until late February,"(CNN) A federal judge in Texas said Friday that he'll likely extend his hold on the Biden administration's deportation moratorium until February 23.

Earlier this week, Judge Drew Tipton of the Southern District of Texas, a Trump appointee, blocked the administration's 100-day pause on deportations, delivering a blow to one of President Joe Biden's first immigration actions.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, had sued, leading to the first legal block of one of Biden's executive actions.

Tipton initially blocked the administration from executing its deportation pause for 14 days. The temporary restraining order, Tipton argued, was appropriate under the Administrative Procedure Act.

But during a status conference on Friday, Tipton suggested he'd extend his block, as the case proceeds until February 23. The Justice Department could appeal the temporary restraining order, but didn't indicate Friday whether it intended to do so.

NASA mission will zoom by asteroid before returning sample to Earth,"(CNN) A NASA spacecraft that took a sample from an asteroid 200 million miles away now has a plan to come back home.

On May 10, NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will leave the near-Earth asteroid Bennu and begin a nearly three-year journey back to Earth, NASA officials announced this week.

The spacecraft, formally known as the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer, is carrying a hefty sample it collected from the asteroid's surface in October. The goal of the mission was to collect 60 grams or 2 ounces of material -- and even though the scientists won't know for sure until they open it, it appears the collection event exceeded this goal. Regolith is a layer of dust and broken rocks on the surface of asteroids and planets.

The sample from the asteroid could shed more light on the formation of the solar system and how elements like water may have been delivered to early Earth by impacts from these rocky leftovers.

When OSIRIS-REx departs Bennu in May, it will begin the 200 million-mile trek back to Earth. It's expected to deliver the sample to Earth on September 24, 2023.

"Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, how it works and why it matters","(CNN) A third Covid-19 vaccine, one made by Johnson & Johnson, could be authorized for use in the United States in the near future. Data about the single-shot vaccine released Friday, and the company is now collating its data to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization. The vaccine was made through a collaboration of J&J's Belgium-based vaccine division, Janssen Pharmaceutical, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and it works a bit differently.

Here's what's known about how it works and how it will fit into the mix of vaccines.

How effective is it?

Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 single-shot vaccine was shown to be 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial, the company announced Friday.

The vaccine is 85% effective overall at preventing hospitalization and death in all regions where it was tested.

Its efficacy against moderate and severe disease ranged from one country to another: 72% in the US, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa. This was measured starting one month after the shot.

In South Africa, 95% of cases in the trial were due to a variant known as B.1.351, which is known to be more contagious and carries mutations that may make the virus less susceptible to the antibody immune response -- including antibodies prompted by vaccination.

Even those who got moderate cases of Covid-19 in the trial tended to develop a milder course and fewer symptoms, said Dr. Mathai Mammen, Janssen's global head of research and development.



From one month after the shot, all hospitalizations and deaths occurred in the placebo group.

How it works

The J&J vaccine is what is known as a non-replicating viral vector vaccine, using a common cold virus called adenovirus 26.

Scientists made this vaccine by taking a small amount of genetic material that codes for a piece of the novel coronavirus and integrating it with a weakened version of adenovirus 26. J&J scientists altered this adenovirus so it can enter cells, but it cannot replicate and make people sick.

AstraZeneca uses a similar platform, but its adenovirus comes from a chimpanzee.

The adenovirus carries the genetic material from the coronavirus into human cells, tricking them into making pieces of the coronavirus spike protein -- the part it uses to attach to cells. The immune system then reacts against these pieces of the coronavirus.

""So you're not being infected with the virus that can give you Covid-19 when you get this vaccine. It just has some of the harmless Covid virus proteins on its surface,"" explained Dr. William Schaffner , an internist and infectious disease specialist with Vanderbilt University's Department of Health Policy. ""So essentially it's a sheep in wolf's clothing, and when your immune system sees it, it responds to it and creates protection against it and in the future, against the real virus that causes Covid-19.""

The technology used in the Covid-19 vaccine has worked with the Ebola vaccine by Janssen

How is it different from the other Covid-19 vaccines?

Dr. Paul Offit , the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the Moderna, Pfizer and J&J Covid-19 vaccines all take a similar approach, but there is a small difference with the J&J approach.

""In the case of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine you're just giving the gene in a lipid nanoparticle or a fat droplet,"" Offit said. ""In the case of J&J you're giving the gene in a virus that can't reproduce itself.""

The J&J vaccine is the only Covid-19 vaccine so far to be given in a single dose. Moderna and Pfizer's use two. Like Moderna's, it can also be kept at regular refrigerated temperatures and does not need a deep freeze like Pfizer's.

How does a single-dose shot affect the rollout?

A single dose and would be much easier to administer and would mean more people could be vaccinated, as none would need to be set aside to give someone a second shot.

""This advantage goes up in neon,"" said Schaffner who believes adding a vaccine like this would ""really accelerate"" vaccination efforts in the US and around the world.

""If it's a single-dose vaccine, then a billion vaccine doses would translate into a billion people vaccinated,"" said Dr. Dan Barouch of Harvard Medical School, who helped develop Johnson & Johnson's vaccine candidate on CNN's Coronavirus Fact vs. Fiction podcast.

The cold-chain advantage



J

&J's other advantage is that it can be stored at regular refrigerator temperatures, unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which needs special deep freezers. The vaccine is stable for up to three months at 36 degrees F to 46 degrees F, the company said. That means health care facilities would not have to buy extra equipment to safely store the vaccine.

""If they're successful, these vaccines would especially be popular in the developing world, because they would be easy to store and administer,"" said Dr. Rafi Ahmed , the director of the Vaccine Center at Emory University.

The vaccines would also be popular in rural communities in the US and regular doctor's offices that may not have access or the budget to afford specialized equipment.

""In other words, we could bring the vaccine to the people,"" Schaffner said, ""rather than bringing the people to the vaccine.""

What happens next?

The company will request what's known as an emergency use authorization, or an EUA, from the FDA in early February.

The data will get a close look from the FDA and advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While the FDA is reviewing the data, it schedules a public meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. The committee is made up of independent science and public health experts who will discuss the J&J data and make a recommendation to the agency.





Once an application is submitted, ""The FDA really looks very, very carefully at the data in each age group and in each demographic group,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a call on Friday.

After the meeting, FDA staff members consider the committee input along with the agency's evaluation of the company's data and will make a decision about whether the vaccine should by authorized.

Shortly after an EUA, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also known as ACIP, goes through the data, too.

Once the CDC committee has made a recommendation and it has been approved by the CDC director, the company plans to ship the vaccines immediately and it can go into arms right away.

How long does the authorization process take?

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

The process for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should be about the same as it was for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, according Offit, who is a member of the FDA's VRBPAC.

With the Pfizer vaccine, it took a little over three weeks from the time the company submitted its data to an EUA. With the Moderna vaccine, it took a little more than two weeks.

If the vaccine is authorized for emergency use, ""our plan is to have supply immediately upon launch,"" Mammen said.



How many doses are there?

The US has ordered 100 million doses and the company has been manufacturing it while it has been testing the vaccine. Typically, companies wait to make the vaccine after its been approved, but that changed during the pandemic.

Johnson & Johnson says it can meet its 100 million dose commitment by June."
FBI lawyer from Russia investigation sentenced to probation for Carter Page FISA warrant false statement,"(CNN) Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith will not serve jail time for changing a document that backed a surveillance warrant of former Trump associate Carter Page during the early Russia investigation, a federal judge ruled on Friday.

He is the only defendant charged in the Durham investigation , which has looked closely at the FBI's work on the early Russia investigation, including Page's ties to Russia and others with ties to the Trump 2016 campaign.

Clinesmith was sentenced to serve 12 months probation and 400 hours of community service. He pleaded guilty last year to falsifying information in an email that wrongly said Page had not been a CIA source previously, as the FBI sought to renew a foreign surveillance warrant for Page in 2017.

""Anybody who's watched what Mr. Clinesmith has suffered is not someone who would readily act in that fashion,"" Judge James Boasberg of the US District Court in DC said, somewhat rejecting the Justice Department's argument that Clinesmith receiving a harsh sentence would help deter others from crime and that he was akin to Mueller investigation defendants who lied and went to prison.

Boasberg, who is also the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's presiding judge, notably said he believes the warrant still may have been signed for surveillance of Page, who in 2017 was a former Trump foreign policy adviser who was under investigation because of his ties to Russians.

"Anti-science movement set up US for worse pandemic, infectious disease expert says","(CNN) The anti-science movement has set up the United States and the world up for a worse Covid-19 pandemic than otherwise would have been, infectious disease expert Dr. Peter Hotez argued Thursday.

""An anti-science disinformation campaign of unprecedented magnitude and led by both multinational corporations and some governments, especially the Russian and US Governments, fuels the pandemic,"" Hotez, dean for the National School for Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, wrote in the journal Plos Biology

""Although President Trump did not win reelection and the new Biden administration has vowed to mount an evidence-based pandemic strategy, the anti-science pursuits of the Trump White House and Coronavirus Task Force have caused serious harm,"" Hotez wrote.

The essay comes as the US races to try to get a majority of Americans vaccinated by the end of the summer, an endeavor that depends on many Americans overcoming their skepticism of the rapidly developed vaccines to get the pandemic under control.

The Covid-19 pandemic arrived as the anti-vaccination movement had been amplified and politicized on the internet, Hotez said. He pointed to vaccine disinformation efforts both in Russia and the US that appeared to accelerate in 2014 ahead of the 2016 US presidential election that led to Trump's presidency.

"Pipe bombs found near Capitol on January 6 were placed the night before, FBI says","(CNN) Two pipe bombs near the Democratic and Republican party headquarters discovered on January 6 were planted the night before the insurrection at the Capitol, the FBI said Friday.

Federal authorities again increased the reward for information about the pipe bomber and released new details and photos of a suspect on Friday, underscoring the urgency the Justice Department is treating this angle of the investigation , which remains one of the most troubling mysteries for law enforcement.

A new wanted poster says the bombs were placed between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m. on January 5, the night before the insurrection.

The FBI also identified the suspect's shoes as Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes in yellow, black, and gray, and included enhanced photos of them, along with photos of the devices.

The reward for information leading to the location, arrest, and conviction of the person or people responsible for placing the bomb is now $100,000. The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had already increased the reward once -- to $75,000 -- earlier this month.

Dogecoin soars 370% as Reddit group works to send the cryptocurrency 'to the moon',"The virtual currency, which originally started as an internet parody based on a viral dog meme, has skyrocketed 373% in the last 24 hours, according to Coinbase . At one point, it was up 613%.

One dogecoin is now worth a mere $0.0469, but that's still easily at record levels.

It's the latest bizarre twist in the retail investing revolt making front pages all over the world. The surge came after a popular Reddit forum — not unlike the WallStreetBets group behind GameStop's rally — set its sights on pumping up the digital currency.

The forum SatoshiStreetBets has featured scores of users calling for a dogecoin rally over the past day. Satoshi refers to Satoshi Nakamoto, the screen name of the self-proclaimed inventor of bitcoin.

Users are urging others to buy in, declaring they could propel the cryptocurrency's value ""to the moon.""

For hours, the page was flooded with memes and images of a shiba inu, the dog breed at the center of the internet meme that inspired dogecoin.

One user called for a ""coordinated"" buy-in at 9 p.m. US Central time. Others called on investors in India and Europe to help prop up the virtual currency during US overnight hours.

Even Elon Musk got in on the action, on Thursday tweeting a photo of a fake magazine cover titled ""Dogue"" instead of ""Vogue.""

The Tesla CEO has engaged in similar banter before. Last month, he spread the word about the cryptocurrency, tweeting: ""One word: Doge."" He even temporarily updated his Twitter bio to read: ""Former CEO of Dogecoin.""

Months before, Musk tweeted another image of dogecoin, sending the price up 14%.

The excitement this week has been palpable. Dogecoin's market cap has soared 380% over the past 24 hours, and currently stands at $6.9 billion, according to cryptocurrency tracker CoinMarketCap . Its trading volume has surged 2,200% in the same time period.

"Royal family documentary, 'banned' for decades, is leaked onto YouTube","London (CNN) An infamous 1969 fly-on-the-wall documentary about the British royal family, supposedly banned by Queen Elizabeth II for decades for giving the public an overly intimate view of the royals, has been mysteriously leaked onto YouTube.

The film provided an unprecedented look inside the royal households and was watched by millions when it first aired on the BBC. But it was subsequently stashed in the corporation's archives, reportedly at the request of Buckingham Palace, and hasn't been aired since the 1970s.

It isn't known how the program, titled ""Royal Family,"" was unearthed or who posted it to YouTube. The video was swiftly removed from the video-sharing platform after a copyright request was made.

In the film, the monarch reportedly compares the US ambassador to a gorilla. ""There was a gorilla. I had the most terrible trouble ... he had short body, long arms,"" the PA Media news agency quoted her as saying.

Other, more mundane scenes, showing the royals eating together and the Queen rummaging in her purse to buy six-year-old Prince Edward candy in a shop, were considered groundbreaking for showing the famously opaque family in a new light.

If individuals age 65 and older were the only people being vaccinated, Alaska could fully vaccinate its seniors – with both shots of the two-dose regimen – within 43 days. In Iowa, Hawaii, Idaho and Florida, it could take more than 130 days, or more than four months.

The analysis considered the total senior population in each state, along with the average pace of vaccine administration over the past seven days, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In four states, more than one in five people are 65 or older, according to data from the US Census Bureau: Maine, Florida, West Virginia and Vermont.

At the current pace of vaccinations, it would take Florida 131 days to fully vaccinate its senior population if they were the only group being vaccinated. However, West Virginia is administering vaccines at a per capita rate that’s about 32% faster than Florida, and could fully vaccinate its senior population in 87 days.

About two weeks ago, the federal government – under the Trump administration – issued new guidance to states to expand vaccine eligibility to adults 65 years old and older, along with health care workers and long-term care residents and staff. But both Florida and West Virginia had adapted their plans to focus on senior populations sooner.

Florida’s vaccination plan has left many frustrated by apparent lack of coordination, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has defended the state’s plan and its emphasis on protecting older people.

“We put seniors first and other states soon followed,” he said at a press conference.

About a quarter of Florida’s senior population – more than 1.1 million people 65 years or older – had received at least one vaccine dose, according to the state’s latest vaccine report.

In West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice said in a news conference Monday that nearly 74,000 seniors had received at least one dose of vaccine – about 20% of the state’s 65 and older population.

While vaccine administration may be moving faster in some states, the focus on the senior population may not be as high.

In Michigan, for example, vaccine administration is 17% faster than Florida. But only 17% of seniors in the state have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to the state’s vaccine dashboard."
EU regulators recommend authorization of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine,"(CNN) The European Union's medicines regulator on Friday recommended authorizing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for use among its 27 member states, capping off a turbulent week which saw the bloc attack the drugmaker over delays to supply.

The long-awaited decision from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) came after several EU countries warned they were running out of vaccine doses, and as coronavirus deaths pile up across the continent.

In a bid to tackle concerns over supply, the European Commission also adopted new measures Friday that could restrict the exporting of Covid-19 vaccines outside the bloc in some situations.

The EMA's authorization of the vaccine for use in all adults stands in contrast to an announcement by the German vaccine commission Thursday that it would not recommend the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged 65 or over because of insufficient data.

In a statement, the EMA said most of the participants in AstraZeneca's clinical trials were between 18 and 55 years old, meaning there was limited data on how well the vaccine would work in older people.

""However, protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines; as there is reliable information on safety in this population, EMA's scientific experts considered that the vaccine can be used in older adults,"" it said. ""More information is expected from ongoing studies, which include a higher proportion of elderly participants.""

The EMA authorization recommends giving the second dose within four and 12 weeks after the first.

The United Kingdom, which authorized AstraZeneca's vaccine on December 30, has been administering doses to people older than 65 for nearly a month. Health officials there have adopted a policy of extending the interval between the doses up to 12 weeks in order to give more people the protection of a first dose as soon as possible.

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot welcomed the EMA's decision. ""Today's recommendation underscores the value of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, which is not only effective and well-tolerated, but also easy to administer and, importantly, protects fully against severe disease and hospitalizations,"" he said.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is the third to be given authorization for use in people aged 18 and over by the EMA. It is cheaper and easier to transport and store than the other two, produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.

Supply dispute

For the past week, the EU and AstraZeneca have been locked in an acrimonious dispute over vaccine supplies. A week ago, the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant said it would not be able to deliver as many doses as the European Union expected because of production issues at a manufacturing site, upending the bloc's vaccination plans.

The disagreement is playing out against a dire backdrop. EU countries including Germany were already running low on vaccines even before the AstraZeneca vaccine was authorized Friday. The US drugmaker Pfizer had previously slowed EU deliveries of the vaccine it developed with BioNTech while a manufacturing facility was upgraded.

The European Commission -- which ordered 400 million AstraZeneca doses on behalf of EU member states and is poised to start rolling the first ones out across the bloc -- said the delay was unacceptable, and the drugmaker must find a way to increase supply.

Earlier this week, Soriot told Italy's la Repubblica that at least 3 million doses would be shipped to Europe as soon as the vaccine was authorized, and that the goal was to deliver 17 million total doses by the end of February.

During a briefing on Friday, he explained that delays and teething issues on some production sites were inevitable. ""Manufacturing ... vaccines is extremely complicated, it's not like (making) orange juice.""

He added that the company is ""focused on supplying the European Union but at the end of the day everybody needs to recognize that it's a complicated process.

""The problem is what we've done nobody thought was possible nine months ago and now that it has been done, people take it for granted and they think it's simple, it is not simple, it is very complicated and some issues will happen,"" Soriot said.

The European Commission published on its website Friday the redacted contract signed with AstraZeneca for the purchase of its vaccine for all the EU member states.

The EU had asked AstraZeneca to publish the contract, signed on August 27, following the company's announcement of delays. The details of the vaccine delivery schedule have been redacted from the published document.

Vaccine export measures

The commission announced new restrictions Friday that made Covid-19 vaccines manufactured in the bloc subject to export authorization. It said the new mechanism would not affect humanitarian aid or COVAX, the global initiative aiming to distribute some 2 billion vaccines to poorer countries.

Speaking in Brussels earlier on Friday, European Commission executive vice-president Valdis Dombrovski said that ""the measure is time limited and specifically applies to those Covid-19 vaccines that were agreed by advance purchase agreements.

He added that ""the protection and safety of our citizens is a priority and the challenges we now face left us with now other choice but to act.""

""We are not in competition or in a race against any country,"" said European Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides, speaking alongside Dombrovskis. ""The only race we are in is against this virus, and this is what has been at the center of every single piece of work that we have been doing for almost a year.""

As part of the export measures on vaccines, the EU stated that there was a risk of vaccines leaving the bloc via the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, and entering Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK but has special status allowing trade on the island of Ireland.

In acknowledging this, the EU said that it was willing to use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol -- an emergency measure that could be used by either the UK or the EU to retain stability on the island of Ireland.

If the EU invoked Article 16, that would mean it would restrict any effort to use Northern Ireland as a backdoor to circumvent export controls. But even raising the prospect of invoking Article 16 is extremely controversial.

It suggested that the EU would be willing to place restrictions on items moving between the two Irish nations, something all sides wanted to avoid during Brexit negotiations for fear of cross-border sectarian violence returning to the island.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed his ""grave concerns about the potential impact"" of such a move during a call with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen on Friday evening, according to a 10 Downing Street spokesperson.

Then, in an apparent backtrack late Friday night, the commission issued a statement saying it will not trigger the Article 16 emergency Brexit clause.

""In the process of finalisation of this measure, the Commission will ensure that the Ireland / Northern Ireland Protocol is unaffected. The Commission is not triggering the safeguard clause,"" the Commision statement said.

However, the commission warned that ""should transits of vaccines and active substances toward third countries be abused to circumvent the effects of the authorisation system, the EU will consider using all the instruments at its disposal.""

In response to the sudden about face from Brussels, the Irish leader, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, said he ""welcomed the decision by the EU not to invoke the safeguard clause of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol.""

""This is a positive development given the many challenges we face in tackling COVID-19,"" he added.

The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, also welcomed the move and said lessons should be learned. ""The Protocol is not something to be tampered with lightly, it's an essential, hard won compromise, protecting peace and trade for many,"" Coveney said on Twitter

Concerns over expected shortages of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines means some French regions, including Paris, will push back or cancel appointments for first injections, the French health ministry said in a press statement on Thursday.

In Spain, the regional government of Madrid stopped administering first doses of vaccine on Wednesday for the next two weeks to ensure there is enough to provide second doses for those who already got their first shots."
State Republican lawmakers eye mail-in voting restrictions in Georgia and other key states,"(CNN) Republican state lawmakers in battleground states Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania have moved to impose new restrictions on mail-in voting for future elections.

All three states were fiercely contested in the 2020 election and saw record numbers of early and mail-in voters , many of them Democrats, after rules were relaxed due to the pandemic -- triggering baseless claims of fraud by President Donald Trump and other Republicans that culminated with the deadly January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.

Despite the absence of widespread security issues with mail-in voting, GOP lawmakers in all three states are arguing for added security and proposing steps that would make it harder to qualify for or cast mail-in ballots.

In Georgia, even Republicans who broke with Trump over his election claims are backing a party-sanctioned move to require photo ID. In Pennsylvania, the state GOP has moved to undo a 2019 law on no-excuse absentee voting. And in Arizona, lawmakers want to make voters re-request ballots each election.

The bills come in direct opposition to efforts that voting rights groups like the National Vote At Home Institute are advancing this year.

""I think they've been fed bad information about the availability, effectiveness and data as it relates to vote by mail. Absentee voting and vote by mail benefits all voters regardless of their political or partisan stripes,"" Amber McReynolds, CEO of the group, told CNN.

The measures, if passed, could have a significant impact on upcoming 2022 midterm elections, as Republicans have failed to hold a majority in the Senate but have noticeably gained members in the House.

Jonathan Diaz, who is legal counsel for voting rights at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, said the current push by some GOP-controlled legislatures to make it harder to vote in upcoming elections is part of what he described as a ""long con,"" by some Republican politicians.

""The justification that all of those legislators have cited is that 'the public has lost confidence in our election system.' What those legislators are leaving out is their role in creating that lack of confidence,"" Diaz told CNN.

""There were no allegations of fraud that were substantiated in the 2020 election,"" he added. ""There's no reason to make voting harder, other than to give them a partisan advantage.""

ID requirements proposed in Georgia

Georgia Republican state Sen. Jason Anavitarte filed a bill Wednesday that would require voters to show photo ID when applying for and returning their absentee ballots -- a move backed by Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who like other top Georgia officials disputed Trump's false accusations.

""I think the best step forward is just to look for an opportunity to create a photo ID process,"" Duncan, who presides over the state Senate, said at a press conference on Tuesday . ""I think that best fits the needs of 11 million Georgians, or at least the folks that are going to vote.""

David Ralston, speaker of the Georgia House, has also said he backs a voter ID law. Spokesman Kalen McMichen said the Speaker has appointed a Special Committee on Election Integrity as a result, ""which will take a thorough, fact-based approach to examining our election processes and seeing if any changes need to be made.""

""Their goal is to ensure our elections are fair, accessible, secure and transparent,"" McMichen said in an emailed statement to CNN on Wednesday.

Enacting a photo ID law reflects the state party platform call to change voting laws.

""As soon as we may constitutionally convene, we will reform our election laws to secure our electoral process by eliminating at-will absentee voting. We will require photo identification for absentee voting for cause, and we will crack down on ballot harvesting by outlawing drop boxes,"" said the state senate GOP when announcing their 2021 legislative priorities in December.

Pennsylvania GOP eyes repeal of no-excuse voting

In Pennsylvania, Republicans are looking to completely repeal a no-excuse absentee voting law passed in 2019 through the state's GOP-led legislature.

State Rep. Jim Gregory, a Republican co-sponsor of the bill , told CNN that the goal is ""not to fix what happened but to restore integrity and trust"" back into the voting process.

""It's about repealing it,"" said Gregory. ""The confusion that took place afterwards, and just the lack of faith in how things were run, is really affecting people's belief and desire to want to vote again. That is especially true in my district.""

Gregory said he hopes that the bill will be the starting point to significant election reforms.

""We need to start the conversation somewhere, and so I'm going to throw out there a complete repeal and see where it goes, because you're not going to get what you want when you begin the negotiation, but you're hoping to get something more palatable,"" Gregory added.

Arizona GOP eyeing changes to mail-in registration

In Arizona, one GOP sponsored bill would repeal the state's permanent early voting list -- which allows a voter to automatically receive a ballot by mail for every election.

Another bill introduced by the chair of the state's House elections committee, Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, would remove voters from the PEVL who fail to vote in both primary and general elections in two consecutive election cycles and also don't respond to a final notice.

Ugenti-Rita called the bill a ""good housekeeping"" measure in a phone interview with CNN and said it's about ""keeping an accurate voter list.""

""The individuals that may be removed, are individuals who have shown or have demonstrated that they don't prefer that preference. They're not voting by mail, so you cannot take something away from someone that somebody is not doing,"" said Ugenti-Rita.

She also said that the election committee is considering several other election maintenance bills including one that would require voters to drop off their mail-in ballots before Election Day."
Louisville police department gets harsh rebuke in new report commissioned after Breonna Taylor's killing,"(CNN) The Louisville Metro Police Department received a harsh rebuke in a new study commissioned by the city in the wake of the police killing of Breonna Taylor last year.

The department is ridden with low morale and is not trusted by the Kentucky city's communities of color, according to the 150-page report released by city officials.

The LMPD has been in the national spotlight since Taylor's death. The 26-year-old emergency room technician was shot and killed by Louisville police officers in her apartment during a flawed forced-entry raid in the early hours of March 13, 2020.

The report made several recommendations, including more community engagement and a better department structure. It noted in particular that that many people of color don't trust police officers ""due to generations of problematic relations.""

Breonna Taylor

""We have committed to reimagining public safety, and that requires an unflinching, comprehensive look at what LMPD is doing well, and what can be done better,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said Thursday. ""An independent audit like this is an extraordinarily valuable tool in making an organization better, and we plan to lean into the findings here -- good and bad.""

Small blast goes off near Israeli embassy in New Delhi,"New Delhi (CNN) A small blast went off close to the Israeli embassy in the Indian capital of New Delhi on Friday afternoon, damaging the windows of parked vehicles.

New Delhi police said a ""very low intensity improvised device"" went off around 5 p.m. local (6.30 a.m. ET) in the center of the city. No injuries were reported.

Israel is currently treating the explosion as a terror event, an official at the country's foreign ministry told CNN. The official said it is too early to say for sure whether the embassy was the target but ""this is one of the investigation directions at this stage.""

An Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson said earlier there were no casualties in the blast and there had been no damage to the building.

Delhi police said the windows of three vehicles were the only things to be damaged in the blast, adding that on ""initial impressions"" the explosion was a ""mischievous attempt to create a sensation.""

Still no stimulus check? Check the mail for a debit card,"Washington (CNN) Still haven't received your $600 stimulus payment? Check the mail for a debit card.

The Internal Revenue Service sent out more than 100 million payments in January, which were approved by Congress late last year. The vast majority of payments were directly deposited into personal bank accounts, but others are receiving either a paper check or prepaid debit card in the mail. About 8 million debit cards were sent out.

Some stimulus payments are being sent on a debit card that looks like this.

Like the first round of payments, which were worth up to $1,200 per person and were sent out last spring, the agency is sending the payment in three different ways to help speed up the delivery process.

Last year, some recipients mistakenly thought the debit cards were junk mail. The Internal Revenue Service is warning people to keep a careful eye on the mail and that the form of payment may be different than the one received last year. Some people who received a paper check last time may now get a prepaid debit card. The new payment will not be added to any debit cards that were sent for the first round of payments.

The debit cards are being sent in a white envelope with the Treasury Department seal on the outside. The card itself is a Visa debit card issued by MetaBank, the Treasury's financial agent. It can be used to make purchases, to get cash at an ATM or to transfer funds into a bank account without being charged a fee.

"A year into the pandemic, where are all the fast, easy home tests?","(CNN) Last March former President Donald Trump said ""anybody that wants a test can get a test"" for Covid-19. That wasn't true then, and in some parts of the country, finding a test appointment is about as easy to get as Super Bowl tickets.

Regular and affordable testing, if done right, could not only diagnose people who feel sick, it could stop the spread of the pandemic by letting people know if they are contagious and need to stay home, even if they don't feel sick.

Scientists have been pushing for this kind of testing -- accessible, affordable and ideally, at home -- since the start of the pandemic, but it hasn't happened yet.

There are at-home collection kits to make it easy for people to provide a sample, but the sample must still be sent to a lab, and results can take days. One over-the-counter, quick, at-home test has been authorized for use in the United States, but it's not available yet.

""Almost all the infections happen from people who don't know that they're positive, and so what you need is a widespread testing program that helps people identify when they are infectious so they can stop infecting other people,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor and dean at the School of Public Health at Brown University who wants more widespread testing. ""We never really quite built that out.""

China's army of small investors want in on the GameStop mania,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) The frenzy over GameStop has inspired amateurs everywhere to shake up stock markets. Now China's massive army of retail investors wants to get in on the action.

Talk of the video game retailer's epic share surge has taken over Chinese social media and the eye-popping gains in that stock and others have become the envy of the country's young day traders. They're now calling on each other to band together to emulate their American counterparts in driving up the share prices of struggling companies.

""Market makers are trembling in front of retail investors who grouped together,"" wrote one user on the social media website Weibo . ""It will soon be China's turn.""

Just as Millennials and Gen Zers in the United States have bemoaned the hedge funds and short-sellers that are part of the Wall Street elite, many small investors in China have cried foul over what they see as exploitation of the market by the big institutions.

Mainland China's financial markets are very different to New York's. Short-selling is highly regulated and incredibly rare, making it hard for Chinese investors to replicate the US frenzy that has pumped up GameStop shares as a way to stick it to hedge funds that bet the company's stock would crash.

"Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine is 66% effective in global trial, but 85% effective against severe disease, company says","(CNN) Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 single-shot vaccine was shown to be 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial, but 85% effective against severe disease, the company announced Friday.

The vaccine was 72% effective against moderate and severe disease in the US, the company said.

It's a striking difference from vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and it may give pause to people uncertain about which vaccine to get or when they can get one. The vaccines already on the market in the US are about 95% effective overall against symptomatic Covid-19, with perhaps even higher efficacy against severe cases.

But experts say the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will still be useful against the pandemic in the United States and around the world.

Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Friday the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and others will help alleviate stress on the US health care system.

""If we can alleviate that, that is really important -- not only with this candidate, but the others that have already gotten the EUA,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a call with reporters on Friday morning.

""If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress and human suffering and death.""

The vaccine's efficacy against moderate and severe disease ranged from one country to another: 72% in the US, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa. This was measured starting one month after the shot.

In South Africa, 95% of cases in the trial were due to a variant known as B.1.351, which is known to be more contagious and carries mutations that may make the virus less susceptible to the antibody immune response -- including antibodies prompted by vaccination.

With that variant, ""we have a lower protection against milder forms of Covid than we did in the United States, where there were more typical circulating variants,"" Dr. Mathai Mammen, the company's global head of research and development, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

However, even those who got moderate cases of Covid-19 in the trial tended to develop a milder course and fewer symptoms, he added.

But for Mammen, the key result was how effective the vaccine was at preventing severe disease -- regardless of variant or age group.

""Across all geographies, across all variants, we see 85% protection"" against severe disease, he said. That trend increased over time, with no severe cases in the vaccinated group after day 49, according to the company.

From one month after the shot, all hospitalizations and deaths occurred in the placebo group.

The results are based on an analysis of more than 44,000 participants in eight countries, with 468 total cases of Covid-19 split between those receiving the vaccine or placebo. The results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but the company said it plans to do so ""in the coming weeks.""

Johnson & Johnson is expected to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration next week for emergency use authorization, which Mammen said could come by late February.

It will be the third company to seek EUA from the FDA for a coronavirus vaccine. Vaccines made by Moderna and by Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized in December and are now being given to millions of Americans.

'Pretty good' for single-dose, affordable vaccine

Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said that under normal circumstances, there might not be much of a market for a vaccine that is significantly less effective than two others already on the market. But he added that these are not normal times, with a pandemic raging and shortage of vaccines.

Pfizer and Moderna both use genetic technology called messenger RNA, or mRNA technology. Johnson & Johnson uses a weakened common cold virus, known as adenovirus, to carry genetic instructions into the body to prompt an immune response.

""In a better world, we would have abundant quantities of this messenger RNA vaccine, Pfizer and Moderna, and that would be damning for a vaccine that's clearly less effective. But that said, we have limited quantities of mRNA vaccine,"" Offit said.

Offit has been vaccinated, but said if he had not, he would first search out a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, and then if he couldn't find one in reasonable period of time, he would take a Johnson & Johnson vaccine if it was available.Offit said getting one brand of vaccine and later on getting a different vaccine should not pose safety issues.

""I would make an effort to get an mRNA vaccine first,"" Offit said. ""Not being able to get it, and knowing I might not be able to get Pfizer or Moderna for many months, and knowing this virus is still ranging across the country, I would take J&J in the secure knowledge that I could get Pfizer or Moderna later.""

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has advantages, Fauci said.

""A vaccine that's inexpensive, that's a single dose, and that has no cold chain requirements -- that's pretty good,"" Fauci told CNN.

Mammen said the vaccine was well-tolerated, with a ""vanilla, even boring, safety data set"" that included no cases of a severe allergic response known as anaphylaxis. About one in 11 had a fever, but only 0.2% were considered ""Grade 3.""

Fauci said the results would look even better if Janssen did not have to compete against the 94% and 95% efficacy seen in trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — even though the latter are calculated from overall symptomatic disease, while Johnson & Johnson's figures reference only moderate and severe cases.

""You know what the problem is? If this were out there and we didn't have the Moderna 94-95% .... We would have said wow, a 72% effective vaccine that's even more effective against severe disease is really terrific,"" he said in a telephone interview.

""But now we're always judging it against 94 to 95%. Having said that, this is a vaccine that could have use particularly in developing countries to keep people out of the hospital. It has a very good efficacy against severe disease,"" Fauci added.

Trial differences

Johnson & Johnson's Mammen pushed back against comparing its vaccine with those from Moderna and Pfizer.

""It's really hard to compare numbers head-to-head right now without running a study with two vaccines,"" he said.

Mammen said there were key differences between the trials; for example, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine was tested later, when cases were surging even higher in many parts of the world and new variants of coronavirus were already circulating. One in particular, called B.351, was dominant in South Africa when the vaccine was tested there. This variant has mutations that might be expected to weaken the vaccine's effects somewhat.

But it still protected people, Mammen said.

""I'm looking at that South African variant, and I'm seeing that we're able to completely protect against concerning levels of illness, where one might go to a hospital,"" he said.

Plus, people do not have to worry about coming back for a second dose.

""We really wanted it to be a single dose. So we optimized our antigen so that we get enough immunogenicity after one dose, as opposed to two,"" he said.

And, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, it does not have to be stored in freezers. It can be stored for three months at refrigerator temperatures of 36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit.

Janssen is already testing a two-dose regimen of the vaccine and that could increase the efficacy, Fauci said.

""Let's see what that shows. It could possibly bring it up to 90%,"" he said. ""Heck if you got 72 with a single dose, you would think you would do pretty good with a boost.""

100 million dose US contract

The US federal government has contracted to buy 100 million doses of the vaccine, expected to be delivered by June.

Johnson & Johnson has said it's on track to produce a billion doses worldwide.



And the company has been manufacturing doses for months in anticipation that it would get emergency authorization from the FDA. The company hopes to begin shipping its product the day after it gets that authorization.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""We've been manufacturing at risk for a long time -- for more than nine months,"" Mammen said. ""My expectation ... is, towards the end of February, we should have an emergency use authorization.""

A fourth vaccine is also jostling to join the mix in the US market. Maryland-based Novavax released preliminary data Thursday showing its candidate vaccine had an efficacy of 89% in UK trials. And AstraZeneca is working to finish up Phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine, as well.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is made differently from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which use raw genetic material called messenger RNA. Johnson & Johnson's uses a common cold virus called adenovirus 26, which has been weakened so that it does not replicate in the body. It's engineered to carry genetic material from the spike protein of the virus -- that's the part the virus uses to grab onto the cells it targets.

The vaccine prompts the muscle cells in the arm to produce these pieces of spike protein. The immune system recognizes them as foreign and builds a defense, so when a real virus tries to infect cells, the body is ready to fight it off."
Several remaining missing Chibok schoolgirls escape from Boko Haram,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Some of the Chibok schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram nearly seven years ago have finally escaped from their captors, a father of one of the girls told CNN.

Halima Ali Maiyanga, one of more than 100 young women still missing, called her father to say she and others had managed to flee Boko Haram militants Thursday.

""She asked me. Is this my daddy? Is this my daddy, and she started crying. The crying was [so] much and I couldn't hear her very well. I was crying too. I never expected to hear from her again,"" Ali Maiyanga said.

""The whole family is so happy. Our house is full of people who are rejoicing with us.""

Ali Maiyanga said he didn't get a chance to speak to his daughter properly, as she was emotional and the call was short. But he said she and others are safe and being looked after by the Nigerian army.

Merriam-Webster adds 'second gentleman' to describe Doug Emhoff's role,"(CNN) Doug Emhoff is racking up several firsts as second gentleman of the United States.

He is the first male spouse of a vice president; he is the first Jewish spouse of an American vice president; and on Thursday he became the catalyst for a first dictionary entry. Merriam-Webster added ""second gentleman"" to its esteemed dictionary, defining the term as, ""the husband or male partner of a vice president or second in command of a country or jurisdiction.""

Emhoff noted the addition tweeting: ""Well, now it's official.""

Emhoff, a lawyer formerly based in Los Angeles, has been married to Vice President Kamala Harris since 2014. On Inauguration Day, he severed all ties with his law firm DLA Piper , where he had practiced law in intellectual property and technology and its media, sports and entertainment sector, according to the firm website.

He will begin teaching an entertainment law class at Georgetown Law as a professor this week, according to his office.

His role at Georgetown will come after the precedent set by former second lady -- and now, first lady -- Jill Biden, who worked as a community college teacher during the Obama administration. She has said she plans to continue to teach even in her new role.

Emhoff has said he will devote time as second gentleman to social justice issues and other projects in support of the Biden administration. Emhoff tweeted the day after the inauguration that he is looking to his predecessors in the role for inspiration.

""I'll always remember generations of women have served in this role before me -- often without much accolade or acknowledgment. It's their legacy of progress I will build on as Second Gentleman,"" he said.

On Thursday, Emhoff is scheduled to participate in his first solo event as second gentleman, visiting a Washington, DC, nonprofit organization that supports healthy food distribution for those in need.

"Robinhood gets $1 billion infusion, signaling cash crunch","New York (CNN Business) Robinhood raised $1 billion from existing investors just hours after it halted purchases of GameStop, suggesting the free-trading app faced a potential cash shortage.

The startup faced a bipartisan backlash Thursday for its decision to limit trading — a move that ran counter to its stated mission of democratizing investing.

""This is a strong sign of confidence from investors that will help us continue to serve our customers,"" Robinhood said in a statement.

But the fact that Robinhood felt the need to raise so much money, just months after raising hundreds of millions of dollars, signals the financial pressure facing the company. It either faced a liquidity crisis — or narrowly avoided one.

Robinhood told CNBC on Thursday that tapping its credit line was a ""proactive measure."""
Inauguration star Ella Emhoff signs major modeling deal,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

Vice President Kamala Harris' stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, whose fashion choices went viral during last week's US presidential inauguration, has signed with a major modeling agency.

Emhoff will join top supermodels like Karlie Kloss and Gisele Bündchen, as well as singers like Selena Gomez, on IMG Models' prestigious roster. An agency spokesperson confirmed the deal to CNN on Thursday, though declined to give further comment.

The announcement comes just days after IMG Models signed a contract with national youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman, another star of President Joe Biden's inauguration.

Both women sent the internet buzzing with their stylish looks and presence at last Wednesday's swearing-in ceremony. Emhoff impressed fashion watchers in an embellished Miu Miu houndstooth jacket and oversized collar, which she wore over a high-neck Batsheva burgundy dress with puffed sleeves. (She also went viral for a video in which she expressively wiggled her eyebrows.)

Shortly after the presidential inauguration, writer and editor Evan Ross Katz tweeted that Emhoff was ""a style icon in the making."" Fashion retailer Lyst meanwhile reported a 455% spike in searches for Miu Miu within six hours of the inauguration.

Speaking about her choice of outfit prior to Wednesday's inauguration, Emhoff told Vogue magazine that she had prepared her outfit expecting there to be ""some anticipation"" surrounding her -- and her family's -- fashion choices.

""My mood board was very 'little girl,' in a sense, a lot of scalloped collars and big silhouette shoulders and small buttons,"" she is quoted as saying in an interview alongside Batsheva's founder, Batsheva Hay. ""I was going for something girlier, to embrace my feminine side ... because, like, how many times do you prepare yourself to attend an inauguration? This momentous of an event deserves a momentous outfit."""
Violence and slurs from some of Israel's ultra-Orthodox Jews in battle over coronavirus lockdowns,"Jerusalem (CNN) A frightened policeman fires a live round as a warning shot. Young men cowed by baton-wielding officers, drenched in foul smelling chemicals from water cannon, scream abuse. Ultra-Orthodox Jews clashing with Israeli authorities has become an almost daily routine.

At the immediate heart of the tensions is the refusal of some elements within the community to observe tough lockdown regulations that ban gatherings of more than five people inside and 10 outdoors.

More widely, police actions against them are seen by many Israelis as a long overdue effort to end the exceptionalism that has characterized the ultra-Orthodox for decades. It's allowed them to shirk military service, live on state benefits and often act as king makers in Israeli politics, critics and political rivals say.

Bnei Brak, a largely ultra-Orthodox city of more than 200,000, and the small Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim have seen the worst of the violence.

Extremists within the community have been blamed for graffiti on a Jerusalem wall which said that the city's police chief was ""Hitler.""

The atmosphere has become so febrile that some Haredim, as the ultra-Orthodox are collectively known, have pinned yellow Star of David badges on their jackets and labeled recent police crackdowns in Bnei Brak as ""Kristallnacht.""

Israeli police clear ultra-Orthodox Jews blocking a highway in a protest in Bnei Brak on December 27, 2020, against the detention of a member of their community who refused to do military service.

These allusions to the Holocaust and allegations of Israeli ""Nazism"" have been widely and immediately condemned by rabbis and politicians from within the Haredi community. But the same leaders have been equivocal, at best, over whether to obey the country's lockdown and social distancing regulations during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The leader of the Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox community, Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, has repeatedly ordered the community's schools to stay open in defiance of government regulations over many months. Recently the rabbi is reported to have said that they should not open if confrontation with the police looked likely.

The rate of Covid-related deaths in people over 65 among the ultra-Orthodox was estimated last December to be about 3.6% higher than the Israeli norm, according to the Ministry of Health.

Health ministry data show Haredi communities to be suffering infection rates of well over 20% of those tested, and ultra-Orthodox patient admissions are among the highest in the country.

Haredi families have an average of seven children and are (alongside Israeli Arabs) the poorest community in the country. They live in densely packed areas where the men are encouraged to spend a lifetime in religious study.

Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men study in a hall divided with plastic sheets to protect against Covid-19 in Bnei Brak on October 25, 2020.

Almost half of the Haredi population lives in material poverty, according to the OECD.

Although rarely integrated with other parts of Israeli society, they live highly active social and religious lives. Gathering frequently in large numbers is a central part of their cultural life.

""Every day for hours, we are in synagogues, we are meeting each other, we are together in lessons, we meet the rabbis every day, more on Shabbat,"" Dov Halbertal, an ordained rabbi and expert on Jewish law, told CNN.

""In the end it is very difficult practically [to socially distance]. Besides we are big families, we have people of every age, we have 10 people in one small apartment, it's very difficult... To be locked in the apartment, you are used to a social life,"" he said.

An ultra-Orthodox Jew himself, Halbertal is also deeply critical of fellow rabbis who, for almost a year, have led their communities in rebelling against nationwide regulations intended to lower Israel's Covid-19 infection rate.

He said that many rabbis feared their followers would suffer spiritual damage if they stayed away from study and communal prayer. And that some feared younger members would stray from their congregations altogether.

""The rabbis can lose their power over communities,"" Halbertal added.

But he condemned the Haredim for putting themselves above secular laws intended to save lives.

Ultra-Orthodox Jews block a road in Bnei Brak during a demonstration staged moments before Israel entered a third nationwide lockdown on December 27.

Halbertal spoke on a street in Mea Shearim where almost every corner is plastered with posters announcing the recent deaths of ultra-Orthodox people. They have not all been killed by Covid, but it's hard to avoid a sense that there are more of these black-and-white notices than usual.

""I love the ultra-Orthodox that I belong to. But I see that the moral failure is so deep and for me I cannot sleep at night thinking of the deaths -- of their blood in the earth shouting for us. We fail in the time of our test, of our moral test as religious people,"" said Halbertal.

Israel's government is considering extending a strict lockdown due to end on Sunday for another week, and some politicians have called for a doubling of fines for breaches of social distancing regulations.

Infection rates and deaths have been falling slightly but they remain high even as Israel continues to lead the world in vaccine rollout, with around a third of those targeted for vaccination having had their first shots.

Bnei Brak's mayor, Avraham Rubinstein, insists that his city is getting to grips with the Covid regulations and condemned violence and attacks on the police.

Israeli policemen use water cannon to disperse an anti-lockdown demonstration staged in Bnei Brak by ultra-Orthodox Jews on December 27.

""There are a few people who are behaving violently. We denounce them. We don't want them, and their own communities don't want them. Their communities gave them over to the police,"" he said, just a few days after he'd been personally threatened on the city's streets by mobs of extremist Haredi youth.

Rubinstein insisted that most schools and synagogues are closed and that the municipality was vigorously driving the vaccination campaign. But health ministry data suggest it still has far to go in places like Bnei Brak, with just 12% receiving their first dose. Many other Haredi communities are in the low single figures.

Part of this poor vaccination record may be explained as a result of a boycott encouraged by anonymous red posters seen all over Mea Shearim.

They say that the media is part of a plot to hide evidence that the inoculation campaign began at the same time that a new Covid variant emerged in UK and dub the shot a ""vaccine of death.""

These same posters may also be why a CNN team filming in the area was attacked by yeshiva (religious school) teenage students who tried to break a camera, and called the media ""murderers."""
Tokyo Olympics: Can vaccines save the Games?,"(CNN) In between a surging pandemic and a global scramble for vaccines , the fate of this year's Olympic Games has become shrouded in uncertainty.

Last November, three weeks before the first vaccine doses became publicly available in the United Kingdom, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said he was hopeful an effective vaccine would help the Games to proceed safely.

Fast-forward to January 2021 and organizers may not be able to rely on vaccine rollout in the way they might have hoped as delivery delays have hindered the rollout process, particularly across Europe.

""I think a lot of people had this vested belief that once the vaccine started to roll out, that would really spell the end of Covid and what we would see is that transmission rates would start to plummet, things would get more controlled and we would have some ability to go back to a more normal lifestyle,"" Jason Kindrachuk, an infectious disease expert at the University of Manitoba in Canada, tells CNN Sport.

""The fact is that even with good vaccine rollouts in a number of regions of the world, we're having trouble getting a hold on transmission.""

Athletes happy to wait their turn

Bach also said organizers would ""undertake a great effort"" to ensure that ""Olympic participants and visitors will arrive (in Tokyo) vaccinated,"" while also rejecting suggestions that vaccinations would be mandatory for athletes -- something echoed by Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto during a conference call on Wednesday.

Where Olympic participants rank in the priority list for a vaccine is likely to be a topic of contention. Among athletes, the general sentiment is that they are prepared to wait.

""I think everyone -- as far as I can tell on Team USA -- is on the same page,"" steeplechaser Colleen Quigley, who competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics, tells CNN Sport.

""Yes, we want to get vaccinated so we can safely go to the Games and we can safely have an Olympic Games, but also realizing that we're not first on the list.

""There are plenty of people, old people and people who are working in grocery stores and who are teachers and in hospitals -- all these people who are on the front lines, they definitely are going to be in front of us.

""We're all pretty young, healthy individuals. And we're just going to wait our turn. I feel as much as we want it, we realize we're not going to be first in line. And I think everyone's totally fine with that.""

Colleen Quigley (right) competes in the women's 3000m steeplechase final at the Rio 2016 Olympics.

There could also be logistic hurdles when it comes to vaccinating athletes on a global scale -- especially given how vaccine access, often tied to national wealth , varies around the world.

""We already have issues in high-income regions of trying to get vaccines rolled out in areas that bought millions of doses and trying to figure out: how do we actually target people that are high risk versus those that maybe don't fall politically within that sphere of high-risk disease?"" says Kindrachuk.

""Then you start looking at more middle- or low-income areas of the world -- they're not even at a point of being able to think about what the vaccine rollout is going to look like because of the logistical concerns, storage concerns and the fact that the majority of doses have already been bought up by the wealthiest countries in the world.""

When contacted regarding vaccine rollout issues, the IOC pointed to a statement released on Tuesday outlining a ""toolbox of Covid-19 countermeasures"" to be implemented during the Games, including ""immigration procedures, quarantine measures, testing, personal protective equipment, contact tracing and vaccinations.""

""Vaccines are one of many tools available in the toolbox, to be used at the appropriate time and in the appropriate way,"" said the statement.

""The IOC continues to strongly support the priority of vaccinating vulnerable groups, nurses, medical doctors and everyone who is keeping our societies safe.

""The IOC will work with the NOCs [National Olympic Committees] to encourage and assist their athletes, officials and stakeholders to get vaccinated in their home countries, in line with national immunization guidelines, before they go to Japan.

""This is to contribute to the safe environment of the Games, but also out of respect for the Japanese people, who should be confident that everything is being done to protect not only the participants, but also the Japanese people themselves.""

Logistical challenge

Tokyo 2020 organizers told CNN Sport that meetings were held last year about how the Games could operate even without vaccinations taking place, adding: ""It is our understanding that vaccination policies are being formulated by the government of Japan and other bodies.""

More than 11,000 athletes from over 200 countries took part in the Rio Olympics. Add in support staff and media personnel and the IOC has a major logistical and health challenge on its hands in the age of coronavirus, especially with the Games just six months away.

""We can't just think about this in terms of the athletes, because it's not only the athletes that that are going to be a part of the Olympics -- you have the organizing committees that are involved, you have all the people that are providing support, you have all the trainers,"" says Kindrachuk.

""All of those are potential wheelbarrows for the virus coming into the community ... You look at this idea of putting people into an international location from all over the world -- we only need one individual to kick off that transmission chain.""

Tokyo was placed under a state of emergency earlier this month as Covid-19 cases reached record levels, and across Japan members of the public are concerned about holding the Games given the current state of the pandemic.

A recent poll by Japanese public broadcaster NHK found that 77% of respondents felt the Olympics should be postponed again or completely canceled, with only 16% in favor of holding them this year

The Australian Open , which gets underway on February 8, has provided a snapshot of the potential difficulties facing Olympic organizers, who say they have been monitoring events in Melbourne as well as sporting competitions elsewhere.

A total of 72 players were placed under strict, 14-day hotel quarantines ahead of the tournament following positive tests on their flights. Others have been allotted five hours each day to train in bio-secure bubbles.

JUST WATCHED Rafael Nadal calls for 'wider perspective' from players ahead of Australian Open Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rafael Nadal calls for 'wider perspective' from players ahead of Australian Open 14:25

Following concerns that those quarantining players would be disadvantaged during the tournament, organizers amended the warm-up schedule and also announced that practice sessions, gyms and ice baths would be prioritized for players who had been placed under hard quarantine.

There's no doubt that reducing onsite transmission will be one of the main challenges facing Olympic organizers, and leagues like the NBA have demonstrated how sporting ""bubbles"" can operate effectively

But only 22 teams were present in the NBA bubble, each with a roster no larger than 15.

""It will be very difficult to eliminate infection risk with a group that size,"" Professor Alastair Grant of the University of East Anglia tells CNN Sport, reflecting on the challenge of trying to cope with thousands of athletes living together in the Olympic Village where competitors are traditionally based.

""If you lock people up in their rooms as they have done for the Australian Open, you can reduce the chance of that happening. But it's really very hard to control transmission in a large group, communal-living fashion.""

Organizers insist that the Tokyo Olympics will get underway on July 23.

Bach bullish

As they continue to evaluate how to host the Olympics safely, organizers have also had to quash reports saying the Games will be canceled altogether.

Last week, the Times of London, citing an unnamed senior member of the ruling coalition, said Japanese authorities had privately concluded that the Olympics could not proceed amid the pandemic -- a report labeled as ""categorically untrue"" by the IOC.

Tokyo 2020 organizers, meanwhile, offered assurance that they were ""fully focused on hosting the Games this summer.""

At a press conference on Wednesday, Bach reiterated that the IOC is ""confident"" of delivering the Games safely.

""We are not speculating on whether the games will take place, we are working on how the Games will take place,"" he said, adding that ""more than 7,000 sports events have been organized by the international federations this winter ... and none of them developed into a hotspot (of infection).""

Meanwhile, the final artistic swimming qualification event ahead of the Olympics due to be held in Tokyo in March has been postponed until May amid travel restrictions in Japan, organizers announced on Thursday.

The event, originally scheduled to take place from March 4-7 at the Tokyo Aquatics Center, was also set to double up as an Olympic test event with Covid-19 countermeasures in place."
AOC rejects Cruz support over Wall Street chaos: 'You almost had me murdered',"(CNN) Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday accused Sen. Ted Cruz of ""trying to get me killed"" during the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and called for his resignation from the Senate, after the Texas Republican appeared to agree with her on the need for an investigation into Robinhood following chaos on Wall Street.

""I am happy to work with Republicans on this issue where there's common ground, but you almost had me murdered 3 weeks ago so you can sit this one out,"" the New York congresswoman wrote in a tweet directed at the Texas senator Thursday. ""Happy to work w/ almost any other GOP that aren't trying to get me killed. In the meantime if you want to help, you can resign.""

She continued, ""You haven't even apologized for the serious physical + mental harm you contributed to from Capitol Police & custodial workers to your own fellow members of Congress. In the meantime, you can get off my timeline & stop clout-chasing. Thanks.""

CNN reached out to spokespersons for both Cruz and Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday afternoon.

Ocasio-Cortez's comments to Cruz came as she discussed the news Thursday that Robinhood, a trading app, restricted trades on GameStop and other highly volatile stocks, blocking retail investors from buying those stocks but allowing Wall Street to.

"As variants threaten Covid-19 progress, US weighs trial results of Johnson & Johnson vaccine candidate","(CNN) As Covid-19 variants are increasingly found in the United States, experts say Johnson & Johnson's vaccine candidate would help in the pandemic fight, despite trial reports showing apparently lower efficacy rates than two vaccines already authorized in the US.

Johnson & Johnson's single-shot coronavirus vaccine was shown to be 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial and 85% effective against severe disease, the company announced Friday . It was 72% effective against moderate and severe disease in the US, the company said.

The vaccines already on the market in the US -- two-dose products from Pfizer and Moderna -- are about 95% effective overall against symptomatic Covid-19, with perhaps even higher efficacy against severe cases.

Johnson & Johnson said Friday it intends to apply next week to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization, or EUA, for its vaccine candidate.

A member of the panel that will advise the FDA about its decision told CNN Friday that the Johnson & Johnson product would be quite useful, assuming the agency authorizes the vaccine.

""The Johnson & Johnson data, I think, are overall encouraging in that it can prevent you from being hospitalized and dying,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.

""And at a time when this virus is running wild in this country and we don't have enough (vaccines yet from Moderna and Pfizer), I think (the Johnson & Johnson candidate) is a good sign, assuming it gets EUA approval.""

Offit has been vaccinated but said if he had not -- and if a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine were not available to him in reasonable period of time -- he would take a Johnson & Johnson vaccine, if it were available

Another expert noted Johnson & Johnson's assertion that the vaccine's protection against severe disease increased over time, with no severe cases reported in the vaccinated group after day 49.

""Protection got better the farther you got out from the vaccination, and ... if we had followed this several more months,"" the efficacy could be even greater than reported, Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN Friday.

Mathai Mammen, head of research and development at Janssen, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine division, said his company's vaccine and the two in use already in the United States ""can't be compared head to head,"" because the virus was less widespread during the trials of the other two and there was ""less pressure on the vaccine to protect.""

""And there were none of these problematic variants that everyone's talking about now,"" Mammen told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

Osterholm pointed to potential advantages of Johnson & Johnson's candidate: Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, it would take only one shot; it does not have to be stored in freezers; and it can be stored for three months at refrigerator temperatures.

""For many clinics out there, this is going to be the ideal vaccine to have. One dose, stable vaccine -- use it,"" Osterholm said.

Johnson & Johnson already is testing a two-dose regimen of the vaccine, and that could increase the efficacy, Dr. Anthony Fauci said.

""Let's see what that shows ... Heck if you got (72%) with a single dose, you would think you would do pretty good with a boost,"" said Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Model: Variants could add tens of thousands of US deaths by May

Johnson & Johnson's report came as more cases of highly contagious coronavirus variants are being found in the United States. On Thursday, South Carolina confirmed two cases of a variant of the virus first identified in South Africa.

The emergence of this and other variants, including one first identified in the United Kingdom and one in Brazil, is a ""wake-up call,"" Fauci said at a White House news briefing Friday.

""We will continue to see the evolution of mutants ... we have to be nimble in order to adjust readily to make versions of the vaccine that are actually specifically directed to whatever mutation is actually present at any given time,"" Fauci said.

To stop the spread of variants, we should be treating each case of coronavirus as if it is one and take action to stop it from infecting others, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""By the time someone has symptoms, gets a test, has a positive result and we get the sequence, our opportunity for doing real case control and contact tracing is largely gone,"" Walensky said Friday at a news briefing. ""So I think and I believe that we should be treating every case as if it's a variant during this pandemic right now.""

The concerning thing about the South Carolina cases is that the people didn't know each other, were not in contact with each other and were not traveling, Walensky said on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""

The variants are likely to worsen the spread of coronavirus across the US and add to the death toll, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington forecast Thursday.

Its model now forecasts 594,624 deaths by May 1 as its most likely projection -- 25,000 more deaths than in the last projection from IHME, which forecast 569,000 Americans would die from Covid-19 by May 1.

Rapid variant spread would take that number up to 620,000 by May 1, IHME said. And in a worst-case scenario, nearly 654,000 Americans could be dead of Covid-19 by May 1, IHME says. That's 85,000 more than IHME forecast as its most likely May 1 scenario just last Sunday.

Still, it doesn't take a new variant to make the forecast numbers of deaths grow, said IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray.

""We have not been seeing governments taking action to apply cautionary measures as quickly as expected, and have incorporated that information into the modeling,"" Murray said. ""Without measures to control the spread of the disease, mobility remains higher and transmission is more likely.""

Deaths would stay lower if Americans simply wore masks and stayed home more. If most people followed social distancing and masking guidelines, 30,000 fewer people would die by May 1, according to the IHME.

States work to get over the distribution hurdle

In US states, leaders have taken different tacks in approaching lags in vaccine distribution and administration.

West Virginia, which has been vaccinating people at a rapid clip, is allowing all residents 16 years and older to register for a vaccine after all residents at nursing homes and assisted living facilities who wanted the shots have gotten them, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday.

""Next week there will be vaccine clinics in all 55 counties,"" Justice said. ""This will make sure our limited supply of vaccines gets to every corner of the state.""

In Connecticut, more than 364,200 total doses have been administered as of Thursday -- meaning 35% of people 75 and older have been inoculated in the state.

""Connecticut continues to be a leader in getting people vaccinated,"" Gov. Ned Lamont said during a news briefing Thursday, adding that the promise from the Biden administration to increase state allotment by 16% means more people will be vaccinated faster.

Next week, Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington will become Kentucky's first regional vaccination site, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. The site will vaccinate 3,000 residents the first week, prioritizing those 70 and older.

But in Ohio, officials must change plans because the state wants students back to school in March.

While vaccine supply in the state is limited, Ohio has pulled vaccines from its allocation to set aside around 55,000 for the state's K-12 school staff every week, Gov. Mike DeWine said.

Meanwhile, Idaho is calling for more transparency in how its current distribution plan is going, Gov. Brad Little said.

""Quite frankly, we need a clearer picture to shine more light on vaccine administration,"" Little said during a Thursday news conference in Boise.

His new order requires both private health care companies and public health districts to tell the state on a weekly basis how many doses it has received, how many doses have been used and how many doses are still in inventory. The numbers will be posted to the state's public online Covid-19 dashboard.

Part of the goal is to make sure providers are meeting the state's goal of having each available dose used within seven days of delivery."

Australia has now had 12 days without a local infection in any of its states or territories, Health Minister Greg Hunt said at a news conference on Friday.

""That's a testament (not just) to the work of our medical professionals, our public health teams, but Australians everywhere for the way in which they've observed the distancing requirements, the way they have protected each other, the way that they've come out for testing,"" Hunt told reporters.

Australia's tough approach to the coronavirus has been controversial ahead of the Open, with some players arriving from overseas frustrated to find themselves in quarantine.

Serena Williams of the USA elbow bumps with Naomi Osaka of Japan after their match during an exhibition tournament at Memorial Drive on January 29, 2021 in Adelaide, Australia.

Some took to social media to complain while others issued lists of demands to Australian authorities. But speaking to CNN from quarantine earlier this week, Nadal said that his fellow stars should have a ""wider perspective.""

""I feel very sorry for all of them but when we came here, we knew that the measures were going to be strict because we knew that the country is doing great with the pandemic,"" Nadal told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday.

To date, Australia has reported 28,800 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including 909 deaths."

Fauci says Biden's push to reopen schools in 100 days 'may not happen',"(CNN) Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, cautioned Thursday that President Joe Biden's push to reopen most schools within 100 days ""may not happen"" as the US continues to grapple with high Covid-19 transmission.

""The President is taking very seriously the issue ... both from the student standpoint and from the teacher standpoint,"" Fauci said during a virtual event sponsored by the National Education Association.

""He really wants to and believes that the schools need to reopen in the next 100 days, essentially all the K to 8 schools, within 100 days. That's the goal. That may not happen because there may be mitigating circumstances, but what he really wants to do is everything within his power to help get to that.""

Biden is pushing Congress to approve another $170 billion for K-12 schools, colleges and universities to help them operate safely in person or facilitate remote learning. Congress approved $82 billion in aid for schools in December, which Biden has said he views as a ""down payment.""

The new funding would be part of a broad $1.9 trillion relief package that would also include expanding unemployment benefits and direct stimulus checks.

Thailand arrests 89 foreign tourists for violating Covid-19 rules,"(CNN) — Thai police arrested 89 foreigners on suspicion of breaching coronavirus restrictions after raiding a party at a bar on a popular resort island in southern Thailand , police told CNN on January 29.

Police said 22 Thais were also detained in the raid Tuesday night at 360 Bar on Koh Phangan, which is in the Gulf of Thailand off of Surat Thani.

Attendants and organizers of the party are facing charges of violating an emergency decree which was put in place last March to combat the coronavirus. Most of them have been released on bail, and only 28 are still being detained, said Police Col. Panya Nirattimanon, chief of the Koh Phangan provincial police station.

According to reports, police learned about the party when they saw tickets available for purchase online.

Among the foreigners arrested were 20 French citizens, 10 Americans and six Britons. All of the arrested were swabbed by local health authorities and found negative for Covid-19, Nirattimanon said.

""They are stranded tourists who can't leave Thailand due to Covid,"" Nirattimanon said. ""They may think it is OK to gather in large groups and I think they may want to relax and have some fun.""

The maximum penalty for violating the emergency decree is two years' imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 40,000 baht ($1,330). The organizers are facing an additional charge of serving alcohol as this area in Thailand is banned from serving alcohol inside restaurants under the emergency law.

Koh Phangan is a popular destination for backpackers due to its monthly full moon parties, which have been canceled.

Thailand closed its borders to international tourism in April 2020. For the most part, the country remains off limits for all but returning nationals and permanent residents, though foreign tourists can apply for a Special Tourist Visa (STV)

All international arrivals are subject to a 14-day quarantine at a state-approved facility.

For months, Thailand reported few locally transmitted Covid cases thanks to its strict quarantine-on-arrival rules."
UK prepares to welcome thousands of Hong Kongers fleeing national security law,"Hong Kong (CNN) The United Kingdom is preparing to welcome potentially tens of thousands of migrants from Hong Kong , with the opening of a new visa for residents of the former British colony this Sunday.

Last year, China imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong that critics say has stripped the city of its autonomy and precious civil and social freedoms, while cementing Beijing's authoritarian rule over the territory. Since then, many prominent activists and politicians have fled, while others have begun quietly arranging to move overseas.

The law criminalizes secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, and carries with it a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.



Soon after it was proposed, the UK government announced it would provide a new path to citizenship for holders of British National (Overseas) passports, which were introduced in the final years of British rule over Hong Kong, enabling residents to hold onto a degree of British citizenship, though without any long term right of abode in the UK.

In a statement Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said by taking this move, ""we have honored our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy -- values both the UK and Hong Kong hold dear.""

According to data from the UK Home Office, acquired by CNN through a freedom of information request, since July 2019, when anti-government protests broke out across the city, over 400,000 BN(O) passports have been issued to Hong Kong residents, more than the total number issued for the previous 15 years.

At the time the national security law was proposed, the number of passports issued jumped from 7,515 in June 2020, to over 24,000 in July. Those numbers may also be lower than the amount of people applying, as the coronavirus pandemic appears to have impacted the processing of passports last summer.

Before the UK announced the new path to citizenship, there were around 350,000 BN(O) passport holders , but the number of people who are eligible -- those born before 1997, in British-ruled Hong Kong -- could be as high as 3 million.

China has reacted angrily to the proposed plan, claiming it breaches the agreement under which Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule, which London in turn argues is undermined by the national security law.

In a regular press conference Friday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the UK of ""disregarding the fact that Hong Kong has returned to the motherland for 24 years"" and violating promises made at the time of handover.

He said the BN(O) path to citizenship ""seriously violates China's sovereignty, grossly interferes in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, and seriously violates international law and basic norms of international relations.""

From January 31, Zhao said, China will no longer recognize BN(O) passports as travel documents or identification, ""and reserves the right to take further measures.""

Hours later the Hong Kong government followed mainland China's lead, announcing in a press release that BN(O) passports were being removed from the list of accepted travel documents from January 31.

It's not clear what practical effects such moves will have, however, as most Hong Kong residents, whether foreign or Chinese nationals, use locally-issued identification cards for the purposes of entering or exiting the territory, and also for most identification purposes. Many of those who are eligible for a BN(O) passport will also be entitled to apply for, and may already hold, a Hong Kong passport, which can also be used for these purposes.

BN(O) passports have never been fully accepted for travel to mainland China, where ethnic Chinese Hong Kong residents use a ""home return"" permit along with their Hong Kong identification card or passport.

Given the limited scope of this immediate response, many have suggested further steps could be coming, especially if a large number of people exit Hong Kong in coming months.

According to the South China Morning Post , a Hong Kong newspaper, the Beijing government has mulled stripping BN(O) holders in Hong Kong of the right to hold public office and potentially even the right to vote.

Writing earlier this month , Regina Ip, a member of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's cabinet, suggested that as a result of the UK's move, Beijing could revoke the right of Hong Kongers to hold dual citizenship, something not enjoyed by people on the mainland, and impose Chinese nationality laws fully on the city.

""Thereafter, Hong Kong Chinese who acquire a foreign nationality of their own free will, will be deemed to have lost Chinese nationality, in strict accordance with Article 9 of the Chinese Nationality Law,"" Ip said. ""When they make a conscious decision to leave and, by implication, give up on Hong Kong, it is only right that they should be asked to make their choice -- China or a foreign country -- foreign citizenship or the right of abode and the right to vote in Hong Kong.""

Despite this and other threats, researchers estimate as many as 600,000 Hong Kongers could move to the UK within the first three years of the policy, and potentially far more, as continued crackdowns under the national security law prompt people to leave.

Nor might BN(O) holders be the only people leaving. Around the time of the 1997 handover, many Hong Kongers acquired foreign citizenship, especially in Commonwealth countries such as Canada and Australia, both of which had generous immigration policies at the time.

Pro democracy activists and protesters who do not hold foreign nationality have also begun applying for asylum overseas in greater numbers , particularly in the wake of a crackdown last year on those who took part in the 2019 unrest.

In December 2020, former lawmaker Ted Hui dramatically fled Hong Kong, taking advantage of a fake environmental conference to jump his bail, and has now sought asylum in the UK. Nathan Law, a prominent former lawmaker and leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, has also claimed asylum there, while others have sought protection in Germany, the US, and Australia.

Escaping overseas does not always equal complete freedom: Law and other exiles have complained of being tailed and even harassed by people they believe are agents of the Chinese government, a charge Beijing's representatives have denied. They are also limited in what communications they can have with family and friends back in Hong Kong, for fear of getting them in trouble with the authorities.

While most BN(O) holders living in the UK are unlikely to be monitored in such a way, the intense political environment around the new scheme may make it difficult to return for those who decide they do not want to stay in Britain.

Ray Wong, an activist who fled to Germany in 2017, becoming among the first Hong Kongers to gain asylum in Europe, told CNN last year that he missed ""basically everything in Hong Kong.""

""I miss being surrounded by Hong Kong people, being surrounded by Cantonese-speaking people,"" he said. ""I even miss the very unpleasant climate."""
Tesla Model S upgrade comes with super fast Plaid Mode and 520 miles of range,"(CNN) Tesla has added some new upgrades to its Model S sedan, including a new rectangular steering wheel that looks like it belongs in a race car or an airplane, and its new super fast Plaid Mode with an option for an extended 520-mile driving range.

Cars with Plaid Mode have batteries and three electric motors that can produce up to 1,020 horsepower and can take the car from zero to 60 miles an hour in just two seconds. That's faster acceleration than any other production car, including ultra-expensive exotic cars from the likes of Lamborghini, Ferrari and Bugatti.

The Model S now comes with Tesla's Plaid Mode, offering faster acceleration that can take the car from zero to 60 mph in just two seconds.

Tesla TSLA Plaid Mode is a step up from the previously available Ludicrous Mode. Using Ludicrous Mode, aModel S can scurry from a dead stop to 60 mph in about 2.5 seconds, which was already comparable to many supercars.

The Tesla Model S Plaid, which costs $120,000, provides an estimated 390 miles of driving range on a full charge. A driver would likely only get that sort of range without tapping into the car's extreme acceleration. The Tesla Model S also comes in Plaid+, which costs about $140,000, and accelerates even more quickly -- although Tesla's website doesn't detail how much more quickly. Tesla says the 1,100-horsepower Plaid+ Model S can drive more than 520 miles on a single charge.

The names Ludicrous Mode and Plaid Mode are taken from the movie Spaceballs, a 1987 Star Wars parody directed by Mel Brooks. In Star Wars, when spaceships entered ""hyperspace"" and were traveling faster than the speed of light, the movie screen filled with streaks of smeared starlight. In Spaceballs, a spaceship could go so fast that the streaks of light became plaid.

'Long Covid' still puzzles doctors but treatment is possible,"(CNN) Medical professionals are working to understand more about a condition they are calling ""long Covid,"" among patients who experience lingering symptoms months after recovering from coronavirus.

""Persons with long Covid often present reporting persistent, severe fatigue, headaches and brain fog, which is defined as mild subjective cognitive impairment, approximately four weeks after acute illness,"" Dr. Alfonso Hernandez-Romieu, a member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Covid-19 response team, said during a CDC briefing Thursday.

A study recently published in the journal The Lancet found that of 1,733 coronavirus patients treated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, 76% were still experiencing at least one symptom six months after their symptoms began.

Doctors have reported that the severity of Covid-19 illness may have little impact on whether patients experience long Covid symptoms, Hernandez-Romieu said.

Dr. Allison Navis, an assistant professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said one of the most common symptoms of long Covid is called ""brain fog.""

An elderly woman fell and couldn't call for help. Her USPS mail carrier saved her life,"(CNN) When a USPS mail carrier noticed an elderly customer had not picked up her mail in three days, she had an overwhelming feeling that something was wrong.

Shonda Lemon, 34, has worked as a USPS mail carrier in Chicago for eight years. She often greeted Helen Iwanski, 89, during her route. Although they exchanged few words, she said their relationship was sweet.

""I've always had a soft spot for the elderly,"" Lemon told CNN. ""So, when I do come across elders, they just take a special place in my heart.""

Lemon wrapped rubber bands around Iwanski's mail so she could grip it easily. And Iwanski randomly taped candy to her outgoing mail for Lemon as a gift.

""I just knew her to be a nice and considerate old lady, so when she would come to the door, I would check on her,"" said Lemon.

US Army announces a new grooming policy in a push for inclusion,"(CNN) The US Army announced a series of new grooming policies on Tuesday that will allow soldiers to wear ponytails, locs, lipstick and even earrings.

According to the new policy, women can wear nail polish as long as the colors are deemed ""acceptable"" and male soldiers are authorized to wear clear nail polish. Soldiers can also highlight their hair as long as they choose a natural color. Certain colors like purple, pink, blue, green, orange, bright red and fluorescent or neon colors are not allowed.

The current policy will also lift restrictions on soldiers braiding, twisting, locking, or cornrowing their hair, although it does set out some specifications for doing so. The new guidelines will go into place in late February.

A review of the policy was initially ordered last year by then acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper in an effort to address race and inequality in the military.

The new policy also removes offensive language like ""Fu Manchu"" and ""Mohawk"" from its wording. In a presentation given by US Military leadership , officials explained that the ""mohawk hairstyle takes its name from the people of the Mohawk nation. Fu Manchu has been considered offensive to Asian culture.""

The push for inclusiveness and equality when it comes to hair has recently been making its way across the US, as seven states have passed legislation to ban natural hair discrimination known as The Crown Act.

Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston went into detail about the policy revision process in a Twitter thread

""I believe we took a good step forward with these changes. I'm proud of the effort that went into this, but the conversation isn't over. We are a learning organization, and it won't be another 5 years before the grooming standard is addressed again,"" Grinston tweeted.

A committee of 17 members, made up of 15 women and 2 men who were mostly people of color, voted on the changes. The new recommendations were based on evaluations from dermatologists, psychologists and an equal opportunity adviser tasked with exploring how diseases like alopecia can be caused at higher rates in certain races and how certain words can have a psychological effect.

""Just because it doesn't look like you or act like you doesn't mean it's right or wrong. That is the whole point of being inclusive,"" Grinston said during a video town hall announcing the changes

As for the men in the Army who are wondering if beards will be allowed, Grinston had a short answer: ""No."""
Many Democrats signal push for swift impeachment trial as short as 'a matter of days',"(CNN) With former President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial increasingly looking like it will end in acquittal, many Democrats are hoping for a swift trial as short as ""a matter of days"" -- and are ready to move on to key items of President Joe Biden's agenda, starting with delivering a $1.9 trillion Covid relief package.

""I think that there should be a trial and it can be relatively expeditious, a matter of days, not weeks,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told CNN's Jim Sciutto Thursday.

Democrats are sensitive to ensuring Trump has a full trial with clear evidence. But they worry a long trial will compete for floor time with Biden's long list of legislative priorities -- especially his large Covid relief package -- and getting his Cabinet and other top government officials confirmed.

Democrats are also arguing that because there is only one article of impeachment -- incitement of insurrection -- and lawmakers all witnessed the events firsthand, the proceedings should be able to move quickly.

""I don't think, based upon the limited nature of the impeachment article, that it should take anywhere near the last impeachment (trial),"" New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez said, referring to the 2020 trial that lasted nearly three weeks.

Philadelphia severs ties with Covid-19 testing and vaccine organization after losing 'trust in them',"(CNN) The city of Philadelphia has cut ties with a Covid-19 vaccine provider, saying it lost ""trust in them as an organization,"" after a slew of controversial moves by the group and its 22-year-old CEO, who admitted Thursday he took vaccine doses and administered them to four friends.

Additionally, Philly Fighting COVID (PFC) unexpectedly shuttered its Covid-19 testing operations to focus on vaccine administration and changed from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit entity -- a shift the health department said it learned about from local news outlets.

Concerns were also raised about changes to PFC's privacy policy that would allow it to sell patients' data collected through their online registration site, according to a report from a local news outlet.

""Trust is the most important thing we have when giving out vaccine, and we couldn't ask Philadelphians to trust an outfit that we no longer trusted,"" James Garrow, a spokesman for Philadelphia's Department of Public Health, told CNN on Thursday. ""So we immediately ended the relationship.""

The department announced Tuesday it ""will no longer work with Philly Fighting COVID to provide testing or vaccines, effective immediately,"" following local news reports of growing concerns around PFC's operations.

WHYY, a public news outlet, reported on January 20 that the PFC's sudden shift to a profit-making business to ""focus on vaccine operations"" left some Philadelphia communities and residents without testing with no warning.

WHYY later reported on PFC's updated privacy policy, which Garrow told the outlet ""could allow the organization to sell data collected through PFC's pre-registration site,"" though the city has no proof any data was sold. PFC's CEO has denied it ever sold any data.

On top of all that, 22-year-old CEO Andrei Doroshin said in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" on Thursday he had taken Covid-19 vaccines intended for eligible recipients and administered them to four of his friends.

Doroshin said he was trying to prevent the doses from going to waste and that he couldn't find anyone else who might need the vaccine more than his friends before they expired.

""The doses were about to expire,"" he told NBC. ""We called everybody we knew. Every single person.""

On Friday, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney directed the health department to ensure that everyone who received a first dose of vaccine from PFC gets a second dose from qualified professionals.

He also called on the health department to produce a report on the city's failed partnership with PFC. Kenney said he was disappointed by what transpired with the organization but was relieved to learn that PFC was only allocated about 6% of the city's vaccine allotment.

""Still, this six percent represents thousands of Philadelphians eager to get their second dose,"" Kenney said.

Doroshin on Friday said he feels he is being used as a scapegoat for the city's ""botched"" vaccine effort.

""The city needs a scapegoat for why they botched the vaccine effort,"" Doroshin told CNN affiliate KYW. ""They probably think they're embarrassed because a 22-year-old did a better job than they did.""

Group vaccinated approximately 6,800 people

On Tuesday, after the city announced it would no longer supply PFC with vaccines, Doroshin said in a statement he never hid the group's intentions to transition to a for-profit business.

""Vaccinating large groups of people takes resources, manpower, and ultimately financial help...We have always intended on scaling up the number of clinics to eventually vaccinate more people (we have been working for months on plans to scale-up vaccinations and have shared them with the city) and money is needed to do that,"" he said.

Doroshin said his PFC never had and ""never would sell, share, or disseminate any data we collected as it would be in violation of HIPAA rules,"" and that ""problematic"" language in the company's privacy policy has been removed.

He also stated that his company pivoted from testing to providing vaccines because ""we did not have enough resources to do both and made a choice to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, as we believe that is what will help end this pandemic.""

Approximately 6,800 people received their first of two vaccine doses from PFC, according to the company. The city's health department says it is contacting everyone who received those doses to schedule their second dose with another facility.

PFC plans to have a news conference on the matter Friday, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer

Allegations 'are serious,' AG says

PFC was first awarded a contract from the city to provide Covid-19 testing services in August 2020, according to Garrow, the spokesman for the city's department of health. At the time, the group presented itself as a nonprofit.

Doroshin had previously been the subject of positive news coverage, focusing on his group's initial efforts to use a 3D printer to make face shields for hospital workers, before turning to testing, according to an NBC News report earlier this month

It was mid-January when the health department ""heard rumors of canceled testing events,"" but contracted testing providers are allowed to set their own schedules.

The health department later learned through news reports that PFC had canceled all of its testing events in mid-January, despite the fact the group is contracted to provide those services through January 31.

Garrow said Doroshin had ""mentioned off-handedly"" the group was considering switching to a for-profit entity in early January and was told it wouldn't be an issue, since the city has vaccine providers who are both for-profit and nonprofit. But the health department learned the change took place in December without its knowledge after news outlets informed health officials.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner's office is reviewing allegations against PFC, according to a spokeswoman for the office.

In his own statement, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the allegations ""are serious and any consumers who believe they have been misled should file a complaint with our office,"" either by phone or online.

""Taking advantage of people and their privacy under the guise of serving as a nonprofit is not only unethical -- it can also be against Pennsylvania law,"" Shapiro said."
Indianapolis shooting: Raymond Childs charged with six counts of murder for allegedly shooting pregnant woman and his family members,"(CNN) An Indianapolis teenager was charged Thursday with six counts of murder for allegedly shooting family members and a pregnant woman on Sunday, according to court documents.

Raymond Childs III, 17, was also charged with attempted murder of a brother who fled the family house after the initial shooting and carrying a handgun without a license, according to court documents shared by the Marion County prosecutor's office.

He is being charged as an adult ""due to his age and the allegation of murder,"" according to a release from the prosecutor's office.

Childs is represented by the Marion County Public Defender Agency, which would not comment on the charges, the agency told CNN.

""We intend to seek justice for the victims, and to do so in a way that respects the process and all of the circumstances present in this case,"" prosecutor Ryan Mears said in the release.

Trump targets Cheney as he unites with McCarthy,"(CNN) Former President Donald Trump is focusing his political energy on targeting Rep. Liz Cheney , the third-ranking House Republican, who voted for Trump's impeachment earlier this month.

According to one source, Trump has repeatedly questioned his Republican allies about efforts to remove Cheney from her leadership position and run a primary candidate against her. He has also been showing those allies a poll commissioned by his Save America PAC that purports to show that Cheney's impeachment vote has damaged her standing in Wyoming, even urging them to talk about the poll on television.

Trump's push comes as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is working to shore up his relationship with the ex-president, including meeting with Trump at his Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago on Thursday. McCarthy and Trump discussed the midterm elections in 2022, according to a readout provided by Save America. The statement claimed Trump ""has agreed to work with Leader McCarthy"" on retaking the majority in the House for the GOP.

McCarthy confirmed Thursday that Trump ""committed to helping elected Republicans in the House and Senate in 2022.""

But it's clear Trump does not want Cheney to be a part of that House majority. Cheney, the chair of the House Republican Conference, was one of 10 Republicans to vote for Trump's impeachment on January 13. Trump's allies within the GOP conference are helping to punish Cheney.

Some in the pro-Trump Freedom Caucus are circulating a petition designed to oust Cheney from her leadership position. One Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, was in Wyoming Thursday to rally against Cheney . Gaetz told the hundreds of rallygoers that he had spoken to Trump ""yesterday,"" and he publicly shared some of Trump's material.

Donald Trump Jr called into the rally and referred to the poll. ""Liz Cheney's favorables there are only slightly worse than her father's shooting skills,"" said Trump Jr. A day earlier, the former president's son tweeted his own criticisms of Cheney.

""It's time to get this RINO out of GOP leadership!"" Trump Jr. wrote.

Cheney's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

McCarthy has expressed his support for Cheney and warned his members against attacking their GOP colleagues who supported impeachment, telling them this week to "" cut that crap out ."" But he has also said he has "" concerns "" about Cheney's vote on impeachment and claimed he did not know her position ""ahead of time.""

""So I support her, but I do think she has a lot of questions she has to answer to the conference,"" McCarthy said in a Sunday interview with Gray TV.

The visit between Trump and McCarthy was a remarkable move for the California Republican, who on January 13 said on the House floor that Trump ""bears responsibility"" for the deadly storming of the US Capitol. McCarthy himself faces pressure from GOP donors and others in the party to distance himself from the former President following the January 6 attack.

One source close to him told CNN McCarthy was warned against ""crawling back to Trump,"" while another source said he was told that the Florida trip would make him look weak.

But in reestablishing his relationship with Trump, McCarthy is considering what will win him back the House and possibly catapult him to the speakership. Sources told CNN he is eager to realign himself with Trump after corporate donors -- including American Express, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Commerce Bank, Dow and Marriott -- have suspended PAC donations to members of Congress who objected to certifying the election for now President Joe Biden.

Thursday's Mar-a-Lago meeting reflects a sense among some Republicans in Washington that Trump remains a singular force within the party and that the former President is an electoral asset, even if Trump left office with the lowest approval rating of his presidency, according to a CNN poll earlier this month.

""President Trump's popularity has never been stronger than it is today, and his endorsement means more than perhaps any endorsement at any time,"" read the statement from the group, which also released a photo of Trump and McCarthy smiling together at Mar-a-Lago."
"A month after the holidays, some people are still getting Christmas packages in the mail","(CNN) It's nearly February, and holiday packages and cards are still making their way to peoples' doorsteps. The reason for all these delays? Like so much right now, the pandemic is partially to blame.

Americans took to online holiday shopping in record numbers , which inundated the system with what the USPS says is a ""historic volume"" of mail and packages. As a result, parcels, cards and other pieces of mail are sometimes taking more than a month to reach its destination. The USPS has so far delivered more than 1.1 billion packages mailed during the holiday season, a record number, it told CNN.

But at the same time, the Postal Service is facing other issues. More than 39,000 employees out of 644,000 have tested positive for Covid-19, a spokesperson for USPS told CNN, representing about 6% of its workforce.

ShipMatrix, a shipping operations software company, found that hundreds of thousands of parcels experienced delays of at least several days, with some taking even longer.

Customers in states like Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey and New York also experienced some of the largest delays,due to heavy snow storms in December, ShipMatrix reported."
"Pentagon won't commit to Afghanistan troop withdrawal by May, says Taliban are not honoring commitments to US","(CNN) The Pentagon said Thursday that the Biden administration would not commit to a full drawdown of troops from Afghanistan by May because the Taliban have not honored the commitments they made in their deal with the United States.

That agreement , negotiated under the Trump administration and signed in February 2020, calls for the militant group to reduce violence and cut ties with terrorist organizations, among other demands. If the conditions of the deal were met, US forces would leave Afghanistan by May 2021. The US force level in Afghanistan went down to 2,500 troops just days before former President Donald Trump left office.

""The Taliban have not met their commitments,"" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said at a news briefing. ""Without them meeting their commitments to renounce terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan national security forces, and by dint of that the Afghan people, it's very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.""

Kirby told reporters the US remains committed to working toward that negotiated settlement between the Taliban and the Afghan governments.

His comments echoed Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who had told Afghan President Ashraf Ghani earlier Thursday that there was ""robust diplomatic support for the peace process focused on helping the parties to the conflict achieve a durable and just political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire that benefits all Afghans.""

Hawley now says objection to Biden's win wasn't intended to keep Trump in office despite past comments,"(CNN) A defiant Sen. Josh Hawley insisted on Thursday that he never intended to overturn the presidential election by objecting to President Joe Biden's victory in Pennsylvania -- despite previously suggesting that Donald Trump could stay in power if Congress acted.

In the aftermath of pro-Trump rioters storming the Capitol seeking to stop the January 6 certification of Biden's win, the first-term Missouri Republican senator has faced a barrage of criticism over his decision to contest the results of Pennsylvania -- with Senate Democrats calling on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate his actions and others calling on him and GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas to resign.

But Hawley has said he has ""no"" regrets, telling CNN: ""I was very clear from the beginning that I was never attempting to overturn the election.""

Yet before January 6, Hawley didn't rule out the possibility that Congress could throw out the electoral results and keep Trump in office. On January 4, Hawley was asked by Fox News: ""Are you trying to say that as of January 20th that President Trump will be president?"" He responded to anchor Bret Baier: ""Well, Bret that depends on what happens on Wednesday. I mean this is why we have the debate. This is why we have the votes."" Hawley repeatedly declined to say Congress wouldn't be able to change the results of Biden's win.

On Thursday, CNN pressed Hawley on the discrepancy between his claim that he never attempted to overturn the election and his January 4 comments that Trump could still be President depending ""on what happens"" on January 6 and his refusal then to rule out Congress could change the outcome. Hawley contended he's been consistent on the point that January 6 was the final day of the electoral process, arguing his sole intention behind objecting was aimed at sparking debate over Pennsylvania's voting system.

New coronavirus variants keep popping up. Here's what we know about them,"(CNN) A variant suspected of helping fuel a surge of coronavirus in Brazil's Amazon region shows up in Minnesota. Another that's been worrying officials in South Africa pops up in two places in South Carolina and, just days later, in Maryland.

Scientists are not surprised to see the coronavirus changing and evolving -- it's what viruses do, after all. And with so much unchecked spread across the US and other parts of the world, the virus is getting plenty of opportunity to do just that.

Four of the new variants are especially worrisome.

""The variants that have been identified recently seem to spread more easily. They're more transmissible, which can lead to increased number of cases, and increased stress on our already overtaxed system,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the newly appointed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a briefing Wednesday.

What scientists most fear is that one will mutate to the point that it causes more severe disease, bypasses the ability of tests to detect it or evades the protection provided by vaccination. While some of the new variants appear to have changes that look like they could affect immune response, it's only by a matter of degree.

Governments are already reacting. Colombia banned flights from Brazil, and Brazil banned flights from South Africa. It's almost certainly too late to stop the spread, and there's some indication the mutations in these variants are arising independently and in multiple places.

Here's what's known about the top four.

B.1.1.7

At the top of the list for researchers in the US is the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in Britain. The CDC has warned it could worsen the spread of the pandemic. It reports more than 300 cases in 28 states -- but those are only the cases caught by genomic sequencing, which is hit and miss in the US.

Although hearing about mutant new viruses can frighten people, scientists say they are reassured by what they have found: The human immune system can handle the variants that have sprung up so far, especially B.1.1.7.

""As far as we know it is transmitted in exactly the same way,"" Gregory Armstrong, who directs the Office of Advanced Molecular Detection at CDC, told CNN.

That means the same measures already known to reduce spread will also stop the new variants: mask use, social distancing, avoiding large groups or crowds and frequent handwashing.

However, the mutations in the variant help it enter cells more easily -- which means if someone, says, breathes in a lungful of air that has virus particles in it, those particles are going to be more likely to infect some cells in the sinuses or lungs rather than bouncing off harmlessly. The worrisome changes enhance the spike protein that the virus uses to attach to cells, meaning people are more likely to become infected by an exposure.

So people need to try harder to prevent spread until vaccination can be sped up.

""In order to interrupt transmission, we are going to need higher rates of what we do to slow transmission,"" Armstrong said. ""We are going to need to pay more attention to wearing masks. And we will need to increase vaccine coverage.""

There have been some confusing reports about whether B.1.1.7 has caused more severe disease in Britain.

""The most recent data indicate from the UK that it appears to be a bit more virulent in the sense of potentially causing more serious disease,"" National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci told a webcast Thursday sponsored by the National Education Association.

B.1.351

The variant first seen in South Africa called B.1.351 or 501Y.V2 was reported for the first time in the US Thursday, in South Carolina. On Saturday, Maryland's governor announced a sample from someone in the Baltimore area had also shown the characteristic mutation pattern of B.1.351.

None of the three people had any contact with one another and none had traveled recently. This suggests the variant has been spreading undetected in the communities.

It's been seen in more than 30 other countries, according to the World Health Organization.

""The variant which was first detected in South Africa has spread quickly beyond Africa and so what's keeping me awake at night right now is that it's very likely circulating in a number of African countries,"" Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said Thursday.

It has a different pattern of mutations that causes more physical alterations in the structure of the spike protein than B.1.1.7 does. One important mutation, called E484K, appears to affect the receptor binding domain -- the part of the spike protein most important for attaching to cells.

It could help the virus partly escape the effects of vaccines. ""There is more concern about immune escape,"" Armstrong said. Vaccine makers and academic researchers are testing samples of this variant, along with others, to see if it can evade the immune response caused by vaccination.

Fauci says even so, there's an extra cushion of immunity caused by vaccination. It gives some wiggle room. ""The good news is the vaccines as they exist now still would be effective against the mutants. The sobering news ... as you get more and more replication, you can get more and more of evolution of mutants, which means you always got to be a step ahead of it,"" Fauci told CNN on Monday.

Teams at Columbia University, the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University and elsewhere have also been testing lab-made versions of the viral mutations against the blood of vaccinated people and say while there does seem to be a somewhat diminished effect of vaccination, its not enough to weaken protection -- yet.

But Maryland-based vaccine maker Novavax released preliminary results of its coronavirus vaccine Thursday that showed while the vaccine was more than 89% effective in a Phase 3 trial in Britain, a smaller, earlier Phase 2 trial conducted in South Africa while the variant was circulating showed efficacy there was only 60%.

Just in case, Pfizer and Moderna say they are working to make booster vaccines that would address mutant versions. The design of the vaccines is meant to make that a quick and easy process -- just plugging in a new version of the genetic code used to generate the vaccines will do it.

There's also evidence the changes may help some escape from monoclonal antibody treatments made by Eli Lilly and Co. and Regeneron.

P.1

A variant suspected of fueling a resurgence of viral spread in Brazil turned up in Minnesota for the first time in January. It was in a traveler from Brazil, so there's no indication yet of community spread.

This variant, called P.1, was found in 42% of specimens in one survey done in the Brazilian city of Manaus, and Japanese officials found the variant in four travelers from Brazil.

""The emergence of this variant raises concerns of a potential increase in transmissibility or propensity for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection of individuals,"" the CDC said. P.1 also carries the E484K mutation.

L452R

Finally, there's a variant seen in California, as well as a dozen other states. ""We don't know yet what the significance of that one is,"" said Armstrong. It also has a mutation in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. It is called L452R and while it's being found commonly, it's not yet clear if it's more transmissible.

Any viral strain can become more common because of what's known as the founder effect. ""The founder effect is a matter of a virus being in the right place at the right time,"" Armstrong said. If a particular strain happens to be circulating when transmission increases because of human behavior, that strain will ride along and become more common not because it spreads more easily, but simply because it was there.

It will take more study to show whether these variants can increase the already astronomical spread of the virus. The US has more than 25 million diagnosed cases and more than 430,000 deaths. But the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has now started including the variants in its projections.

""Rapid variant spread can extend the period of daily deaths over 1,000 well past May 1,"" it says in its January 28 forecast. The IHME projects 595,000 people will have died in the US by May 1.

""The emergence of variants underscores the need for public health action,"" Walensky advised.

""First, get vaccinated when it's your turn. Also, some people may need help getting vaccinated -- please consider helping your neighbors and loved ones schedule or travel to their appointments. Second, wear a mask. Practice social distancing and wash your hands. And finally, now is not the time to travel.""

This story has been updated to correct the name of the variant in California to L452R and to add details of a new occurrence of the B.1.135 variant in Maryland."
'People are angry': House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump face backlash at home,"(CNN) The 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump are facing a wave of anger at home, with Republican officials, donors and voters condemning their votes and primary challengers launching their campaigns early.

The backlash has turned their 2022 primaries into tests of how long Trump can hold the stage in Republican politics and whether GOP voters are willing to turn the midterms into tests of loyalty to him.

The group of 10 Republicans includes moderates in swing districts, as well as some reliable conservatives, including the No. 3-ranking House Republican, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney , and South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice

""It started out big and it's still growing. People are angry,"" said Bryan Miller, the Republican chairman in Wyoming's Sheridan County who said he plans to run against Cheney in the party's 2022 primary. ""She's not living up to what we in Wyoming wanted, across the board. And it's a huge betrayal.""

Anthony Bouchard, a Wyoming state senator who is also running against Cheney, said he's been ""flooded"" with messages encouraging a primary run.

""I believe that her impeachment vote revealed who she has allegiance to, and I don't think the voters will forget it any time soon,"" Bouchard said.

The early seeds of primary trouble for House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump is an illustration of how much loyalty the former President retains within his party, weeks after he departed office and was removed from his favorite social media platforms.

Whether the anger against those 10 lawmakers will survive the next year is far from clear, with congressional districts' makeup certain to shift as states complete the once-a-decade process of redrawing district lines and more than a year for the anger to dissipate and the GOP's focus to move past Trump.

""Each and every one of those 10, when they made that vote, they knew in their heads and in their hearts it was probably a political death sentence. They knew that,"" said former Rep. Joe Walsh, the conservative Illinois Republican whose 2020 primary against Trump did not gain traction.

He said any establishment donor money that goes to support those 10 GOP lawmakers will be ""dwarfed"" by money aimed at ousting them.

""I wouldn't be surprised to see a number of them not even run again, depending on how their districts shake out"" after redistricting, Walsh said.

It's also too early to tell how willing Trump and his family members will be to insert themselves in intra-party battles -- especially after social media bans limited Trump's ability to reach wide audiences easily -- and whether Trump's ire will be focused narrowly on Republicans he believes wronged him, such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who rebuffed Trump's efforts to overturn the state's election result, or if he will cast a wider net. The New York Times reported that Trump is most focused on ousting Kemp, potentially through a primary challenge by former Rep. Doug Collins, and that Cheney is the former President's next focus.

Trump has been showing allies a poll of Wyoming voters commissioned by his super PAC and conducted by Trump's longtime pollster John McLaughlin to make the case that Cheney's vote on impeachment is not popular among Republicans there, a source told CNN. His super PAC also issued a news release highlighting the poll.

On Capitol Hill, Cheney has faced challenges to her leadership role. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida traveled Thursday to Wyoming's state Capitol for a rally opposing Cheney.

Donald Trump Jr. called into Gaetz's event and said Cheney should be ousted in next year's primary.

""It's time to have a change at the top. It's time to have people that are going to start representing the people -- not their own agendas, not their own nonsense, but their constituency,"" he said. ""And since the people of Wyoming are clearly not thrilled with Liz Cheney, let's find someone who can replace her and actually do that job well.""

The Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have all defended their votes by saying they were a matter of principle after Trump encouraged attendees at a January 6 rally to march on the US Capitol -- which led to the deadly riot that afternoon.

Amid the complications of primary challenges against House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump is the potential that -- like in Wyoming -- multiple candidates could enter primaries, fracturing the opposition to vulnerable Republican incumbents.

Still, the impeachment vote has led some state and local parties, as well as major donors, to say that they are dropping their support for those Republicans -- for good.

In Washington, the state's Republican Central Committee passed a resolution condemning Trump's impeachment ""without question or exception"" and expressing disappointment at Reps. Dan Newhouse and Jaime Herrera Beutler, two of the 10 Republicans who voted in favor of impeachment.

The Clark County Republican Women's Group sent a letter to Herrera Beutler explicitly saying it would recruit and back a primary challenger.

""We will do everything in our power as the largest Republican Women's organization in Washington state to recruit and elect a conservative candidate who will represent our values,"" the group said in the January 13 letter

The letter said that ""this vote will never be forgotten, as your action is a personal affront to the 70 million plus Americans who voted for our President.""

In Michigan, the Allegan County Republican Party censured Rep. Fred Upton for his vote, saying that he ""betrayed oath of office and core values"" of the county party.

Tom Norton, the third-place finisher in a 2020 primary won by Rep. Peter Meijer in western Michigan, said he is running again and appeared on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's podcast two weeks ago.

Gene Koprowski -- who launched a primary bid against Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the GOP's most outspoken Trump critics -- named the campaign committee he created on January 14 ""Impeach Adam Kinzinger 2022.""

The ""issues"" page on the website launched by former Fresno city councilman Chris Mathys, who says he'll take on Rep. David Valadao in California, contains just three sentences, all targeting Valadao's impeachment vote: ""President Trump has fought in our behalf to protect our conservative republican values. It is unbelievable that congressman David Valadao would for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. I will do everything to restore our conservative values as a conservative republican.""

The South Carolina Republican Party voted Saturday to formally censure Rice , who was not expected to vote for impeachment but who explained after his vote that the President's response to the riot led him to cross the aisle.

Ken Richardson, the chairman of the school board in South Carolina's Horry County, said he'd long thought he might run for Rice's 7th Congressional District years down the road.

""I didn't know that Tom was going to shoot himself in the foot. But he's done that,"" Richardson said. ""To say I'm getting calls would be an understatement.""

He called Rice ""a nice guy"" and noted that Rice had been to barbecues at his house.

""But the county that we live in right now -- 71% of the people voted for Donald Trump. And if you're the congressman for this area, you've got to understand, that's not Tom Rice's seat and it's not Ken Richardson's seat. That seat belongs to the people,"" Richardson said.

Those considering primary runs said they have already heard from major Republican donors -- and are convinced that GOP primary voters' anger toward those who voted to impeach Trump will ease before the 2022 primaries.

""I do not think this is going to dissipate,"" Miller said.

Richardson said: ""There's no doubt in my mind it's going to last way past the election.""

Why Madison Cawthorn is Trump 2.0,"(CNN) There's a line in a new Time magazine profile of freshman North Carolina Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn that really jumped out at me.

In an email sent to his Republican House colleagues earlier this month, Cawthorn, who at 25 is the youngest person ever to be elected to Congress, boasted: ""I have built my staff around comms rather than legislation.""

As in: He is far more focused on putting together a communications team to help in building a profile -- in and out of the House -- than he is on, you know, actually doing the work that he was elected to do. Although he has been an official House member for just a few weeks, Cawthorn has already shown his penchant for publicity.

Matt Gaetz rails against Liz Cheney in Wyoming,"Cheyenne, Wyoming (CNN) Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida railed against GOP Rep. Liz Cheney here at the state capitol on Thursday, stirring hundreds of Trump supporters and counter protesters after she voted to impeach the former President .

The Republican party is now out of power and grappling with its future, and some elected officials like Gaetz are positioning themselves as the bearer of Trump's brand by attacking other Republicans like Cheney, who are hoping to move past it. Republican leaders have warned that the internecine fight hurts the party but Gaetz has decided to put himself at the center of it.

""We are in a battle for the soul of the Republican party, and I intend to win it,"" said Gaetz on Thursday. ""You can help me break a corrupt system. You can send a representative who actually represents you, and you can send Liz Cheney home -- back home to Washington, DC.""

Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, was one of only 10 Republicans to vote to impeach former President Donald Trump for ""incitement of insurrection"" following the deadly riot at the Capitol on January 6. In a statement at the time, Cheney blamed the violence -- including the death of five people -- directly on Trump, saying he ""summoned,"" ""assembled"" and ""lit the flame of this attack.""

""There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" Cheney said.

But Cheney's decision has sparked a retaliation in Wyoming, which Trump won in 2020 with nearly 70% of the vote, the most of any state in the country.

A GOP state senator, Anthony Bouchard, has announced a 2022 campaign against the congresswoman. The Wyoming Republican state party said ""there has not been a time during our tenure when we have seen this type of an outcry from our fellow Republicans, with the anger and frustration being palpable in the comments we have received.""

And over 55,000 people have apparently signed onto a Change.org petition started by Wyoming resident Shelley Horn to ""recall"" Cheney. Horn told CNN she doesn't consider herself a political person -- she said she ""usually"" makes tutus and minds ""my businesses"" -- but couldn't stomach her congresswoman's decision.

""You just can't go, 'Oh well, I need to vote with my conscience.' No! Vote for what your people put you in there to do,"" Horn told CNN. ""You're a Republican, you're supposed to back your party regardless.""

Dr. Taylor Haynes, a Trump supporter who lost in the state's 2018 gubernatorial Republican primary, told CNN, ""In my view, she's done in Wyoming.""

Gaetz and other Trump allies have pushed for Cheney to step down from her leadership position as conference chair of the House GOP. Now Gaetz, who represents the western panhandle of Florida, has taken the extraordinary step of campaigning against Cheney in her own state, where he spent more of his time sharply criticizing the interventionist foreign policy personified by her and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, than the recent vote to impeach Trump.

""I see every day the cost of the wars that Liz Cheney has advocated for,"" said Gaetz, whose district has a large active military population. ""I see it in the tearful goodbyes at airports, the marriages that are destroyed, the parenting that's interrupted, the drug abuse, the veteran suicide, lost limbs, lost minds, lost lives, lost hope.""

""What are the great benefits that we all get from our misadventures in Syria and Afghanistan and Somalia — places that a lot of Americans couldn't even point to on a map,"" he asked.

Thursday's mostly maskless crowd was filled with signs both in support of Gaetz — ""Impeach Cheney"" -- and the congresswoman — ""Cheney Spoke Truth.""

coalesce around a single candidate to challenge her, as some people cheered for Bouchard. The Trump political operation commissioned a poll this week claiming that the impeachment vote has hurt Cheney's popularity in the state.

""Liz Cheney's favorables there are only slightly worse than her father's shooting skills,"" said Trump Jr.

A source in Cheney's office dismissed Gaetz's event as a publicity stunt, saying that ""Rep. Gaetz can leave his beauty bag at home. In Wyoming, the men don't wear make-up."" The source linked to a video of Gaetz talking about putting make up on for a television appearance.

Gaetz responded at his event that makeup ""only hides the slightest imperfections of the skin. It does very little to conceal the soulless corruption of Washington, DC.""

In Washington, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has equivocated on his level of support for Cheney, saying she should remain in leadership but that he had "" concerns "" about her decision.

""We need a voice in Washington to continue to defend our industry,"" said WMA executive director Travis Deti. ""And it's going to be more important now than it has been in the last few years because President Biden is not going to be friendly to us.""

Gale Geringer, a veteran Wyoming GOP political strategist, praised Cheney's ""courage"" in casting the vote to impeach Trump despite the political pressures.

""I don't underestimate the anger people are feeling right now. It's huge. And Liz Cheney has become the target of that anger, but I don't think she's really the cause of it,"" she said. ""I think it's fear of what the Biden administration is going to do to Wyoming. We're petrified. Our entire economy, all of our jobs, our tax base has been threatened. And there's nothing we can do about Joe Biden for four years. But we can take that fear and anger out on Liz Cheney.""

Wyoming political observers said that Cheney would beat back the critical clamor. And even some of the those in the state who agreed with Gaetz treated him with indifference.

""If he wants to come and do that, OK. It makes no difference,"" said Haynes. ""Wyoming is going to do things as we've always done.""

"One woman injured, 25 structures damaged as powerful winter storm unleashes mudslides in parts of Northern California","(CNN) A Monterey County woman was injured and 25 structures were damaged as a powerful atmospheric river-fueled storm dumped heavy rain and snow on Northern California, triggering mudslides and debris flows.

The woman was injured as she attempted to escape her home during a mudslide, Monterey County Deputy Fire Marshal Dorothy Priolo told CNN. She was treated for non-life-threatening injuries at a local hospital and has been released.

Some evacuation orders in Monterey County remain in place as flood warnings, and advisories were issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) after several inches of rain fell in the area. Continued heavy rainfall with the potential for an isolated thunderstorm is expected through the day, NWS Bay Area said in a tweet

At least 4,000 Monterey County residents are impacted by the evacuation orders, according to Priolo.

Approximately 25 structures in the county, which includes homes and outbuildings, have been damaged by the mudslides and debris flow caused by the rain. A lot of the structures, Priolo explained, are ranch-style properties, ""so even if the home was not affected, in some cases, other buildings on the property may have been.""

Marjorie Taylor Greene removes social media posts amid scrutiny of past controversial comments,"(CNN) Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has removed dozens of Facebook posts from 2018 and 2019 in which she endorsed fringe conspiracy theories and repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians.

Searches of Greene's Facebook show the posts from 2018 and 2019 have been removed. Links saved by CNN's KFile during a review of hundreds of posts and comments from Greene's Facebook page are no longer available.

Greene is facing backlash for her conspiratorial social media posts after CNN reported she indicated support for executing prominent Democrats in Facebook comments and videos.

The freshman congresswoman from Georgia also deleted videos she posted on Facebook Live where she said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is ""guilty of treason"" and that she will ""suffer death or she'll be in prison"" for her ""treason.""

CNN reached out to Greene's office for comment on the removed posts but did not receive a response.

The Human Rights Campaign's State Equality Index examines state-level policies impacting LGBTQ people and their families -- protections like non-discrimination policies in employment, housing and public accommodations, for example.

This year's report, which organized states into four categories based on their anti-discriminatory statutes, determined that there are 25 states in the lowest-ranked category, dubbed ""high priority to achieve basic equality.""

Proposal to build permanent fence around the Capitol meets resistance,"Washington (CNN) A recommendation from the acting chief of the US Capitol Police for permanent fencing and other enhanced security measures around the US Capitol in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection has been met with resistance from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and from the mayor of Washington.

Acting chief Yogananda Pittman proposed permanent fencing in a statement provided to reporters Thursday, but DC Mayor Muriel Bowser quickly slammed the idea and said the city will not ""accept extra troops or permanent fencing as a long-term fixture in DC.""

The proposal for permanent fencing comes weeks after a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol, leaving five people dead and extensive damage to the property.

""In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, back-up forces in close proximity to the Capitol,"" Pittman said.

She continued: ""I look forward to working with Congress on identifying the security improvements necessary to ensure the safety and security of the Congress and the U.S. Capitol.""

Democratic lawmakers demand racial breakdown of Covid-19 vaccinations,"(CNN) A trio of Democratic lawmakers is urging the US Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies to address the racial disparities in Covid-19 vaccinations and collect the demographic data of people receiving the shot to ensure vulnerable communities are not left behind.

In a letter addressed to HHS acting Secretary Norris Cochran, the lawmakers said comprehensive data on the race and ethnicity of the people who have been vaccinated does not exist despite people of color dying and being hospitalized at disproportionate rates.

""This lack of information will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in our most vulnerable communities,"" reads the letter, signed by Rep. Ayanna Pressley, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, all of whom are from Massachusetts.

CNN has reached out to the HHS for comment, but has not heard back.

The letter comes two days after CNN released the findings of its analysis of 14 states that showed vaccine coverage is twice as high among White people on average than it is among Black and Latino people."
Tampa mayor mandates masks at Super Bowl events,"(CNN) Mayor Jane Castor has issued an executive order mandating the use of face coverings during events surrounding the upcoming Super Bowl in Tampa, Florida.

The order, which Castor signed Wednesday, requires face masks to be worn outdoors in event zones and entertainment districts, including parts of Tampa's downtown and the area surrounding the Raymond James Stadium , where the big game is set to take place February 7.

It is intended to mitigate the spread of coronavirus at sites where large crowds of people are likely to congregate for Super Bowl related activities, with limited ability to remain socially distanced from each other, the city said in a news release

Those who are not wearing a mask can be cited with a ""nominal civil infraction"" that carries a penalty up to a $500 fine, according to the order. There are some exceptions to the order, including children under the age of 5.

""We are incredibly excited to host a fun and safe Super Bowl here in Tampa -- but we need everyone to do their part. We want fans to feel confident knowing that when they come out to celebrate Super Bowl LV, they can do so safely in a city that takes this pandemic seriously,"" said Castor.

"January 28, 2021 Trump impeachment and Biden presidency news","As it looks increasingly likely that former President Trump’s Senate impeachment trial will end in acquittal, many Democrats are hoping for a swift trial as short as “a matter of days” — and are ready to move on key items of President Biden’s agenda, starting with delivering a $1.9 trillion Covid relief package.

“I think that there should be a trial and it can be relatively expeditious, a matter of days, not weeks,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut to CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Thursday.

Democrats are sensitive to ensuring Trump has a full trial with clear evidence. But they worry a long trial will compete for floor time with Biden’s long list of legislative priorities — like his large Covid relief package — and getting his Cabinet and other top government officials confirmed.

Democrats are also arguing that because there is only one article of impeachment — incitement of insurrection — and lawmakers all witnessed the events firsthand, the proceedings should be able to move quickly.

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez said “I don’t think based upon the limited nature of the impeachment article that it should take anywhere near the last impeachment (trial)” — which took almost three weeks.

“This is a much less complicated set of facts than when we were dealing with Ukraine,” added Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, referring to Trump’s first Senate impeachment trial where he was charged with two articles of impeachment, one for pressuring Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rival, at the time, Biden.

It’s not yet clear how long Trump’s impeachment trial will last — and the length will depend, in part, on how long House impeachment managers take to present their case, how long Trump’s defense team takes to respond, and when senators are ready to vote on a final judgement.

“The House has to make a decision about how much time it's gonna take and what evidence it wants to put forward” and Trump’s legal team “has to get at least equal time, and probably more so that the fairness of the proceeding’s assured,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat from Rhode Island, told reporters on Wednesday.

Now that Democrats have won the presidency, House and Senate, they’re anxious to start moving on Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief legislation after settling for a smaller stimulus package in December, which Democratic leaders said was just a start.

“To do a trial knowing you'll get 55 votes at the max, seems to me to be not the right prioritization of our time right now. Obviously we do a trial, maybe we can do it fast, but my top priority is Covid relief... and getting the Biden Cabinet approved,” said Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine.

“I would hope that we deal with that as quickly as possible to start addressing the needs of working families,” said Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday.

Sen. Brian Schatz, Democrat from Hawaii, said Thursday there’s “no reason” Trump’s trial should take weeks when “we don't even have a full complement of a Biden Cabinet nominees who have been confirmed.”

Many Democrats also argue since the senators themselves were witnesses to the attack — there may not be a need to drag out the trial longer than a few days or a week.

Whitehouse also speculated Wednesday that perhaps it’ll be in Trump’s best interest, as well, to have a quick trial.

“It may very well be perceived by Trump's team and to be in his interest to minimize, minimize, minimize, rather than draw him out and continue the emphasis on this sort of episode,” he added.

Numerous Democrats and Republicans alike have pointed to the vote on Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul’s point of order to vote on the constitutionality of Trump’s impeachment trial on Tuesday as an indicator for how the trial’s final vote will likely land. Only five Republicans joined all Democrats to kill Paul’s motion and there is no sense that anywhere close to 17 Republicans could get to yes at this point."
Class-action lawsuit filed against Robinhood following outrage over GameStop stock restriction,"New York (CNN Business) A Robinhood customer filed a class-action lawsuit against the stock-trading app Thursday after the company barred traders from buying shares of GameStop promoted by WallStreetBets, a popular Reddit group for investors.

The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, claims that Robinhood's actions rigged the market against its customers.

""Robinhood's actions were done purposefully and knowingly to manipulate the market for the benefit of people and financial institutions who were not Robinhood's customers,"" the lawsuit states.

Robinhood did not respond to a request for comment. The company imposed the stock-trading restrictions Thursday citing ""recent volatility."" The company said in a blog post it will only allow users to close out their positions in those stocks, which include, and

The lawsuit claims Robinhood's decision deprived retail investors of potential gains they could have made by buying when the stock was low and selling when its price rose.

GameStop's stock has soared since January 11 after it hired several new board members that investors believed could help the stock boost its digital sales. Reddit's WallStreetBets group began promoting the stock, sending it soaring more than 1,000% over the past several weeks.

The stock's surge forced short-sellers who were betting against the stock to buy shares to hedge their positions, sending the stock soaring even higher.

Many day traders took advantage of Robinhood's free trades, placing bets on GameStop and other stocks the Reddit group promoted. But those customers are playing a dangerous game. The companies' fundamentals don't support such elevated stock prices, and the bubble could burst, wiping out the traders who had placed big bets on GameStop and the like.

""We're committed to helping our customers navigate this uncertainty,"" the company said in a statement. ""We fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets.""

Robinhood published another blog post Thursday afternoon saying it would ""allow limited buys of these"" stocks starting Friday.

Redditors band together

Following Robinhood's decision earlier Thursday morning, Redditors stood up a new forum, r/ClassActionRobinHood , to coordinate efforts for a lawsuit. It collected more than 31,000 users Thursday.

One law firm that Redditors have engaged with is ChapmanAlbin LLC , based in Cleveland, Ohio, which specializes in investments and financial fraud. The firm's homepage currently has a prompt titled, ""Are you a Robinhood user who has suffered losses?"" along with a way for people to submit information.

The firm has collected information from more than 6,000 people as it investigates Robinhood, attorney Philip Vujanov told CNN.

""This is pretty unprecedented, I've never heard of another scenario like this,"" Vujanov told CNN in a phone interview. ""There's going to be a lot of people left holding the bag.""

Vujanov specifically called Robinhood's actions today ""disingenuous"" while citing a tweet from Robinhood's official Twitter account in March 2016 that stated, ""Let the people trade.""

""Now, all of a sudden, they are changing their position,"" Vujanov said regarding Robinhood.

One avid Wallstreetbets user dismayed over Robinhood's decision was Christopher Kardatzke, 21, a recent college graduate who, along with his brother, have developed free financial software used by Redditors to guide their investment strategy.

""It seems a bit silly. The people of r/wallstreetbets were buying up GameStop and playing a game of Jenga, but it's the same game that hedge funds have been playing for decades and decades,"" Kardatzke said. ""It's a bit ridiculous.""

This sentiment was echoed on Capitol Hill where Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz were among a group of lawmakers to chastise Robinhood's decision.

"Cicely Tyson, iconic and influential actress, dies at 96","(CNN) Cicely Tyson, an award-winning icon of the stage and screen who broke barriers for Black actresses with surpassing dignity, died Thursday, her longtime manager Larry Thompson confirmed to CNN.

She was 96. A family statement did not reveal the cause of death.

The actress chronicled her lengthy career in her first memoir, ""Just As I Am,"" which was just released Tuesday.

Tyson embodied African American women who demanded attention -- and more than that, respect. She played former slaves, civil rights icons, sharecroppers, truthtellers, mothers and other complicated women -- bringing a sense of depth, nobility and grace to every character.

Her filmography includes some of the most celebrated movies and television shows featuring Black women in major roles: ""Sounder"" (1972), ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" (1974), ""Roots"" (1977), ""The Marva Collins Story"" (1981), ""The Women of Brewster Place"" (1989), and ""The Help"" (2011).

Yet she said her most important accomplishment happened in 2016 when President Barack Obama awarded her the Medal of Freedom.

""In her long and extraordinary career, Cicely Tyson has not only exceeded as an actor, she has shaped the course of history,"" Obama said that day.

Tyson described that moment as ""the most important thing that could happen to me.""

""I am one of three children, grew up in the area that is now known as El Barrio and that was the East Side (of New York),"" she told TV host Steve Harvey . ""To come from there to the White House with the first black President ... to put that medal around my neck: Where can you go from there?""

Tyson continued to act well into her 90s, telling Time magazine that she had no plans to retire.

""We have to honor this blessed gift that we have. That's what keeps you going. Keeps your mind fluid -- your heart, your whole being,"" Tyson, then 94, said. ""You can't just stop, because that will be the end of you.""

Tyson was born December 19, 1924, in New York to William and Theodosia Tyson. Early on, she gravitated toward performing, playing piano and reciting in her family's church when she was a child. She later attended New York University.

Tyson said she was ""the bane of her mother's existence"" because she couldn't keep still when she was little.

""I was always going, I was always trying to find things, learn things, make things,"" she told Harvey. ""So I drove her crazy.""

As an adult, Tyson began her entertainment career as a model when she was discovered by a fashion editor at Ebony magazine in the 1950s. She had substantial theater parts in the early part of the decade and was on television regularly in guest-starring roles by the mid-1960s.

It wasn't until ""Sounder"" in 1972 that she had her big breakout movie role. She portrayed the family matriarch in the film about Depression-era sharecroppers and their hunting dog, based on a William H. Armstrong novel.

She was nominated for an Academy Award for her work in the film -- her only Oscar nomination. It would be another 45 years before she took home the golden statue when she received an honorary Oscar in 2018 , the only Black woman to do so.

In 1974, she starred in ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,"" a television movie based on a novel by Ernest Gaines. Tyson was the title character, a woman born into slavery who lives well into the 20th century and takes part in African Americans' struggles for civil rights.

She won two Emmys for the role -- best actress in a drama and actress of the year. During her career, she would win a total of three Emmy Awards out of 15 nominations.

Tyson married jazz trumpeter Miles Davis in 1981, but their union ended in divorce in 1988. She reflected on her one and only marriage in a 2013 interview with CNN's Don Lemon , describing her relationship with the jazz legend as ""tumultuous"" but one that also included ""some of the most incredible moments in my life.""

As her career progressed, generations of entertainers who had grown up admiring Tyson clamored to work with her and gushed about her work.

Actress Angela Bassett, who worked with Tyson on the film ""The Rosa Parks Story,"" proclaimed Tyson as one of her top influences.

Tyson's roles ""were my earliest acting teachers, history teachers, life teachers,"" Bassett said at a 1997 ceremony honoring Tyson with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame

""Cicely Tyson chose to empower us when we didn't even know it was possible for us to be empowered. For six decades, she has been diligent in her pursuit to better us all,"" screenwriter and director Tyler Perry said when Tyson received the Medal of Freedom.

With acting roles in at least 90 movies and TV series dating back to the 1950s , demand for Tyson's skill and grace never abated as she got older. She got roles in TV series such as ""House of Cards"" and Perry cast Tyson in several of his films beginning in 2005.

Oprah Winfrey, who has cited her as a standout, groundbreaker and inspiration, honored Tyson at her famous Legends Ball , celebrating the actress and ensuring that she, and her work, would be introduced to a new generation of film enthusiasts.

She appeared last year on "" Cherish the Day ,"" Ava DuVernay's series on the Oprah Winfrey Network.

Other actors publicly named her as their top role model in the field.

""Ms. Tyson has always been my muse,"" Academy Award-winning actress Viola Davis, who insisted Tyson be cast to play her character's mother on the television drama ""How to Get Away With Murder,"" wrote in Vanity Fair magazine . ""She is excellence. She is courage.""

In 2013, Tyson won a Tony Award for her work in ""The Trip to Bountiful."" It was her first nomination. She later starred in a TV movie based on the play.

Tyson consciously embraced breaking boundaries. In her acceptance speech at her Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony, she referenced the Langston Hughes poem ""Mother to Son"" to explain how she'd lived her life and career.

""All the time, I've been climbing on, reaching landings, turning corners, and sometimes going in the dark where there ain't been no light."""

Mayorkas nomination: Senate breaks filibuster of Homeland Security nominee,"(CNN) The Senate voted Thursday to break a GOP filibuster and advance the nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas to be President Joe Biden's secretary of Homeland Security after Republicans objected to efforts to quickly install a critical leader of the country's national security apparatus.

Now that the nomination has successfully cleared that procedural hurdle, a final vote on confirmation is on track for Monday evening.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has pushed to have Mayorkas confirmed swiftly, but Republicans have argued that the nominee hasn't been properly vetted on immigration issues and have called for an additional hearing on his nomination.

Mayorkas is the first Biden nominee who has met a Republican filibuster, which comes as the Department of Homeland Security grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, national security concerns and immigration.

DHS on Wednesday issued a threat bulletin due to the ongoing potential for violence in the wake of the presidential inauguration, including concerns that domestic extremists may be emboldened by the US Capitol attack earlier this month.

Chief Judge Beryl Howell scorches Capitol riot suspects and keeps man who was in Pelosi's office in jail,"(CNN) The chief judge of the federal court in Washington scorched Capitol riot suspects during a hearing on Thursday, calling their actions an assault on American democracy and ruling that a man who had bragged about putting his feet on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office should stay in jail as he awaits trial.

""This was not a peaceful protest. Hundreds of people came to Washington, DC, to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,"" Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court said in the hourlong hearing for Capitol riot defendant Richard Barnett on Thursday.

Howell's remarks are some of the first from a federal district judge over the more than 150 criminal cases that resulted from the siege. Her decision on Barnett also marks the first ruling in an appeal from the Justice Department after a magistrate judge out of Washington denied its request to keep a Capitol riot suspect in jail. At least four others are awaiting rulings from district judges in Washington after appeals.

Howell made clear she believes the crowd was trying to thwart the federal legislative branch from carrying out its duties.

""We're still living here in Washington, DC, with the consequences of the violence that this defendant is alleged to have participated in,"" she said.

Jim Jordan won't run for Ohio US Senate seat in 2022,"(CNN) Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican and a fierce defender of former President Donald Trump, won't run for the US Senate next year to fill the seat of the retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman, according to a spokesperson for his congressional campaign.

Jordan will instead run for reelection for his US House seat, the spokesperson said.

Jordan's decision leaves what is expected to be a very crowded field of GOP candidates for the primary next year without a clear front-runner. Just some of the possible Republican candidates include J.D. Vance, the author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" and Josh Mandel, who dropped out of the 2018 GOP primary race to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is also seriously eying a Senate bid, along with at least four other Republican members of Congress: Reps. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup, Mike Turner and Warren Davidson.

While it is early in the race and no one candidate was positioned to consolidate Republican voters, Jordan's high profile as a prominent Trump ally put him among the most visible GOP candidates. Had Jordan decided to run, he could have potentially cleared the GOP field -- or set up an early test of Trump's political standing among GOP voters following the Capitol riots.

A GOP source familiar with Ohio politics said that Jane Timken, the chair of the Ohio Republican Party, could get into the Senate race now that Jordan is not running. Timken, the source said, could get the Trump endorsement, has her own money and the party establishment would like her.

On a budget? Here's how to save money on your groceries,"Food tends to eat up a healthy portion of our budget.

We often don't consider how much we're spending at the supermarket because food is a necessity. But many of us are spending more than we have to.

""I call the food budget the silent killer of budgets,"" said Kumiko Love, owner of personal finance website The Budget Mom.

If you're looking to make cuts to your food spending, Love recommends doing it in baby steps.

""Make small incremental steps. Don't go from $1,000 to $400 -- that's a big change,"" she said. ""Do it in $75 increments. If you stick to it, then drop it again by $75. Over time, you decrease it enough to a realistic amount you can stick to.""

But where do they savings come from? Here are some tips on how to reduce your grocery spending:

Always start with a list

Don't enter a grocery store without a list. Think of it as protection against the temptation that abounds, with eye-catching displays and deals for items you don't need.

Before shopping, take the time to plan your meals. Browse the store's deals and base your decisions on what's on sale, if possible.

""Set a dedicated time to meal plan,"" said Love, who does it weekly. ""That allows me to also assess my food budget to know how much I have to spend during these shopping trips.""

Once you have your list, the first stop before your grocery run should be your pantry. It's easy to forget what's sitting on your shelves and waste money on products you already have.

""We've all put away a can of tomato paste to realize you have six already,"" said Love.

Stay home

Having a list isn't enough: You actually have to stick to it.

One way to do that is to avoid the grocery store altogether. Shopping online can make it easier to avoid straying from your plan.

Online shopping also helps you keep track of your total tab as you add items to your cart. It's much easier to delete items from a virtual cart if you are over budget, than to ask the cashier to remove them with a long line waiting behind you at checkout.

Some grocery and big box stores, including Kroger, Albertsons, Target and Walmart, offer online shopping with free pickup.

Amazon Prime members can shop at Whole Foods online and also get free pickup.

Don't just look at the price

The lowest price doesn't always mean it's the best deal. Pay attention to the price per unit -- that will show you which item offers the most for your money.

So let's say you need ketchup: A 32-ounce bottle could cost $2.79 while a 38-ounce bottle is $2.99 The bigger bottle costs nearly 8 cents an ounce while the smaller one is almost 9 cents.

Not all stores will do the math for you, but it's pretty easy to do it yourself: divide the total price by the number of units. The smaller quotient is the better deal.

Put in the elbow grease

With so many choices on the shelves, it's easy to get lazy about cooking. But convenience comes at a price.

Yes, it's nice when the fruit is already sliced, but you you will spend less if you buy the whole fruit and do the work yourself.

And prepackaged meals and prepared items also tend to come with a heftier price tag. For nights when you know cooking time will be limited, try and prepare a meal ahead of time and freeze it until you need a quick dinner.

Use a loyalty app

No one wants to sit home clipping coupons. But getting discounts is less time consuming than it used to be. You can join your grocery store's loyalty programs, follow them on social media and download their apps to find coupons and other deals.

""Check apps and websites for daily deals,"" said Sara Skirboll, a shopping and trends expert at RetailMeNot.com. ""It's a great way to get savings on what you are looking for.""

Get cash back

You might have some money saving help already in your wallet -- some credit cards offer higher rewards for food shopping. And free apps will pay you for your shopping.

American Express's Blue Cash Preferred Card offers 6% cash back at US grocery stores on up to $6,000 in spending a year. That card has a $95 annual fee, but Amex's Blue Cash Everyday card, offers 3% cash back on your first $6,000 of purchases a year at supermarkets with no annual fee.

Tools like Ibotta, which offers cash back and Fetch Rewards, which allows you to accumulate points to earn rewards, can also help save you money."
"Mega Millions prize winner: After a collision in his brand-new car, a man's day ended with a $2 million lotto prize","Want more inspiring, positive news? Sign up for The Good Stuff , a newsletter for the good in life. It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.

(CNN) It sure didn't feel like Anthony Dowe's lucky day when he accidentally hit two deer with his brand-new car.

But a few hours later, the North Carolina man checked his lottery tickets and discovered he'd won a $2 million Mega Millions prize

Dowe had been on his way to work Saturday -- the day after the $1 billion jackpot drawing -- when he collided with the deer in his 2021 Kia K5, the North Carolina Education Lottery officials said.

""So, I just got mad, went back home, got into bed and went to sleep,"" he said Tuesday in a statement . ""Then I woke up and checked my tickets.

""I checked the fourth ticket and I saw the '4' and then the next number and the next number and the next number. I'm like, 'Wow!' It was just crazy.""

Dowe ended up matching all five white balls -- beating the 1 in 12.6 million odds -- to win the $1 million prize. It was doubled to $2 million when the 2X Megaplier was drawn.

""I went and showed my dad and my mom and everybody was happy,"" he said in the statement.

Dowe claimed his prize Monday and took home $1.4 million, after state and federal tax withholdings.

The winning ticket for the Mega Millions jackpot was sold at a Kroger store in Novi, Michigan, according to a Mega Millions news release

Dowe plans to spent the money on some repairs at his parents' house, to pay off his niece's car and to buffer his savings, he said, according to the statement.

He'll also get his own new car fixed, he said -- and pay it off."
Novavax says UK Phase 3 trial shows its coronavirus vaccine has 89% efficacy,"A Phase 3 trial of biotechnology company Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine shows it has an efficacy of 89.3%, the company announced on Thursday.

But the company highlighted the vaccine’s apparent efficacy against new variants of the virus that have alarmed politicians and scientists alike.

The trial, conducted in the United Kingdom, included efficacy estimates by strain based on PCR tests performed on strains from 56 Covid-19 cases in the trial. The vaccine was found to have 95.6% efficacy against the original novel coronavirus and 85.6% against the variant first identified in the UK, known as B.1.1.7.

The company also announced that a Phase 2b study conducted in South Africa, where another variant was first identified, showed 60% efficacy.

""With today’s results from our UK Phase 3 and South Africa Phase 2b clinical trials, we have now reported data on our COVID-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials involving over 20,000 participants,"" Stanley Erck, Novavax president and CEO, said in the announcement.

The company's vaccine, known as NVX-CoV2373, “is the first vaccine to demonstrate not only high clinical efficacy against COVID-19 but also significant clinical efficacy against both the rapidly emerging UK and South Africa variants,” Erck said. “NVX-CoV2373 has the potential to play an important role in solving this global public health crisis.""

Regarding the trial in South Africa, “the 60% reduced risk against COVID-19 illness in vaccinated individuals in South Africans underscores the value of this vaccine to prevent illness from the highly worrisome variant currently circulating in South Africa, and which is spreading globally,” Shabir Maddi, principal investigator in the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine trial in South Africa, said in the announcement.

""This is the first COVID-19 vaccine for which we now have objective evidence that it protects against the variant dominating in South Africa,” Maddi said."
'It's frustrating': Thousands of migrants sit in Mexico desperate for answers from the Biden administration,"(CNN) Within the span of a year and a half, a Cuban couple living on the US-Mexico border were repeatedly threatened, attacked and lost a baby after being assaulted, as they waited for their next immigration court date in the United States under a Trump-era policy .

There has been a presidential transition since they first arrived in Juarez, Mexico, to claim asylum in the US, but their lives remain the same.

""I have locks on the door. I'm threatened,"" said one of the Cubans, a 30-year-old who agreed to share his experience on the condition that CNN not use his name. ""You can't imagine the state we're in. It's something that is so difficult."" Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, a group that represents people in the so-called ""Remain in Mexico"" program, put CNN in touch with the migrant.

""These Trump policies are alive and well on the border ... it's frustrating,"" said Linda Rivas, an immigration attorney and director of Las Americas. ""It's really weighing on people, weighing on their souls. What we saw our clients go through is the opposite of dignity.""

Under Trump, migrants from Central America and other parts of the world who were seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border were forced to remain in Mexico until their immigration court hearings in the United States. That meant waiting months, if not years, in deplorable conditions and under the threat of extortion, sexual assault and kidnapping. Migrants can be easy identified based on their accents or attire and as a result, fall prey to gangs and corrupt authorities, among others.

While it's difficult to know exactly how many people are waiting to be admitted along the southern border, there are more than 22,700 cases pending in courts hearing these cases along the border, according to the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin which released a report on the program.

The Cuban couple -- a husband and wife -- arrived at the US border in July 2019 after fleeing political persecution in their home country. The couple were eventually subject to the policy and have had to wait in Mexico as their case proceeds in the US immigration courts. Last February, the woman, 27, was attacked while pregnant and lost the baby, according to her husband.

Their attorneys have tried to take the couple out of the program so they can wait for their court date in the US, given the circumstances, but the couple has been returned to Mexico each time, including after an attempt last Friday.

Attorneys also asked officials to allow a Honduran woman who was allegedly raped while in Mexico into the US last week. After an hours-long interview with US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the woman and her 11-year-old son were returned to Mexico, according to Rivas.

The agency declined to comment, telling CNN: ""As a matter of practice, USCIS does not comment on individual cases.""

In his first hours in office, Biden moved to draw down the so-called ""Remain in Mexico"" program, which will have been in place for two years Friday, by stopping the enrollment of new migrants. Since October, more than 3,200 migrants have been admitted to the program, formally known as Migrant Protection Protocols, according to data obtained by CNN.

The pandemic shuttered immigration courts and delayed cases, resulting in migrants staying in Mexico for longer periods.

""It's really, really difficult for people that are desperate and in dire situations in Mexico,"" said Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney based in California who works with clients in Juarez. ""These asylum seekers are extremely vulnerable in Mexico, more vulnerable than your average Mexican.""

'Every day there's some new rumor'

Biden plans to announce executive actions that would establish a ""fair but efficient asylum program"" that includes ending the ""Remain in Mexico"" program, Esther Olavarria, deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council for immigration, said last weekend. But it remains unclear what happens to those who have already been subject to the policy, like the Cuban couple.

Kate Clark, senior director of immigration services for the Jewish Family Service of San Diego, said her office has been receiving around 50 calls daily from migrants trying to get guidance on what they should do next.

""We've generally been getting repeated callers asking the same questions in different ways to understand what the process is,"" Clark told CNN, adding that some people have called three to four times ""with the hope that we're going to say something different.""

View of tents belonging to migrants, in Matamoros, Tamaulipas state, Mexico, near to the border with the United States, on November 1, 2019.

Part of the reason behind the flurry of calls is rumors and misinformation circulating on social media. Some of those rumors have directed migrants to the ports of entry or advised them to set up email accounts to receive information from the government, according to attorneys.

""It creates hysteria that's not called for ... Every day there's some new rumor. Disinformation runs rampant,"" said Jodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney who represents clients forced to stay in Mexico. ""Once you get them to understand that nothing is going to happen right away, then they get it.""

Children crossing the border alone

The perilous conditions many families find themselves in has resulted in children crossing the border alone despite initially arriving with a parent or other relative.

As of this month, more than 700 unaccompanied children who had been waiting in Mexico with family as part of the Trump administration policy have crossed the US-Mexico border, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is tasked with the care of migrant children.

Unaccompanied children are exempt from the policy, which means children who cross the border are taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security and referred to the Department of Health and Human Services. While in care, case managers work to place a child with a sponsor in the United States, like a parent or relative.

While the Trump administration came to increasingly rely on the ""Remain in Mexico"" program, the pandemic also gave way for officials to pull another lever -- invoking a public health law, known as Title 42, that allows for the swift removal of migrants apprehended at the US-Mexico border. The order, which remains in effect, has made claiming asylum exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.

""The border is closed to families and single adults, including those seeking refuge from horrific persecution and violence,"" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is challenging the public health order. ""We don't expect the Biden administration to be able to process everyone in the first week, but we need a signal very quickly that he is going to open the border and get rid of Title 42."" The Biden administration has not yet said how it intends to proceed with Title 42.

The new administration has staffed up with people who have extensive backgrounds in immigration law and policy -- a nod to the challenges facing officials on the border as the administration tries to turn the page.

During the transition, incoming officials recognized that it would take time to install safety protocols and address other logistical issues, like processing, before opening the US-Mexico border back up, according to a source involved in the discussions.

Alejandro Mayorkas, whose nomination to serve as head of the Department of Homeland Security will be voted on Monday after a Republican filibuster was broken Thursday, is expected to make addressing the population of people waiting in Mexico a priority.

""He clearly understands the impact of these policies on real people,"" said a source close to Mayorkas. ""That isn't to say this isn't really, really hard, but he knows this isn't something that can be ignored.""

Nongovernmental organizations have also brainstormed how to retrofit their resources to assist asylum seekers who have been waiting, for example by using the domestic refugee resettlement network to provide case management and integration services.

""The administration understands they're going to have a messaging crisis for a lot of reasons and they're wanting to mitigate that and utilize systems already in place,"" said another source involved in discussions.

But patience is wearing thin for those made to wait years in Mexico.

""I don't know if this president will come through on his policies but at least we might have a better future,"" the Cuban migrant told CNN. ""We're very, very desperate. We've been here for a long time."""
2021 just got worse: Now there's a Grape-Nuts shortage,"New York (CNN Business) If you're having a hard time finding Grape-Nuts at your local supermarket, you are not alone.

McCarthy and Trump discuss Republicans' plans to win House majority at Florida meeting Thursday,"(CNN) Former President Donald Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy met Thursday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where the two Republicans discussed strategy for winning the House majority in next year's midterms, according to a readout of the meeting provided by Trump's Political Action Committee Save America.

""They discussed many topics, number one of which was taking back the House in 2022,"" the statement read. ""President Trump's popularity has never been stronger than it is today, and his endorsement means more than perhaps any endorsement at any time.""

The statement described the meeting as ""cordial"" and highlighted a stronger than expected performance among key House GOP candidates, though Democrats maintained their House majority with a slimmer margin

McCarthy's visit comes at a tumultuous time for the Republican Party, following Trump's role ahead of the January 6 deadly riot storming the Capitol that led to his second impeachment just days before he left office. Ten House Republicans voted to impeach Trump and the Senate is expected to pick up the former President's trial next month. Still, all but five Republican senators voted earlier this week that such a trial was not constitutional, outlining just some of the divides in the party, as Democrats now control the legislative and executive branches.

McCarthy released his own statement confirming Trump's account of the meeting, showing he's in lock-step with the former President.

""Today, President Trump committed to helping elect Republicans in the House and Senate in 2022,"" McCarthy said. ""A Republican majority will listen to our fellow Americans and solve the challenges facing our nation. Democrats, on the other hand, have only put forward an agenda that divides us — such as impeaching a President who is now a private citizen and destroying blue-collar energy jobs. For the sake of our country, the radical Democrat agenda must be stopped.""

He added, ""A united conservative movement will strengthen the bonds of our citizens and uphold the freedoms our country was founded on.""

McCarthy was also in Florida fundraising as the House is out this week.

Despite political pressure from some in the GOP that the party must move on from Trump, McCarthy is eyeing what will win him back the House and possibly catapult him to the speakership.

CNN reported earlier Thursday that two sources told CNN that some people warned McCarthy not to go see Trump. A source familiar with the matter said it made McCarthy look weak. Another source close to McCarthy told CNN that the California Republican was told that he would look like he was ""crawling back to Trump,"" and that it would further isolate him from mainstream donors who want to move away from Trump.

Since the early days of Trump's campaign, McCarthy stood by him, earning the nickname ""my Kevin."" Even in the last days of Trump's time as president, McCarthy joined a Texas lawsuit that was struck down by the Supreme Court that sought to overturn the results of the election. Even after the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, McCarthy voted to object to the election results.

Politically, sources have told CNN that McCarthy is caught between Trump's fervent supporters in the party and the GOP conference members who think the attack on the Capitol was sedition, including the 10 House Republicans -- such as GOP conference chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming -- who voted to support Trump's second impeachment.

The fallout has led to questions about McCarthy's leadership in his conference. As much as McCarthy cannot afford to lose support from members of the Freedom Caucus, he also can't lose the backing of members in front-line districts that could help him win back the majority.

McCarthy has backtracked on Trump's role in the insurrection as recently as this week, when he was criticized at his most recent news conference for saying he didn't believe Trump ""provoked"" the insurrection ""if you listen to what he said at the rally"" -- after saying two weeks earlier that Trump bears responsibility.

CNN analysis suggests 12% -- and as much as a third -- of the US population might currently have some protection against Covid-19,"(CNN) Between vaccination coverage and natural immunity among those who have recovered from an infection, about 12% -- and perhaps as much as a third -- of the US population may currently have some degree of protection against Covid-19 , according to a CNN analysis.

About 6% of the US population has been vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Close to 20 million people have received at least one dose of the two-dose regimen -- which trial data shows can offer partial protection against the virus -- and more than 3.8 million people are fully vaccinated.

Studies show that people who recover from Covid-19 are largely immune to the virus for a period of time . About 25 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported to the CDC, representing about another 8% of the population with some protection against Covid-19.

However, the CDC estimates that just a fraction of total Covid-19 cases in the US have actually been reported. The latest estimates show that total cases may have topped 83 million through December. Along with the 5 million or so cases that have been reported in January, about 88 million people -- more than a quarter of the US population -- may actually be protected from Covid-19 after recovering from infection.

Experts say that people who have already had Covid-19 should still get the vaccine. The immunity you get from contracting Covid-19 does last for a certain amount of time, but the nature of the vaccine should provide longer immunity, according to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

The CNN estimates of current protection against Covid-19 do not account for any potential overlap among individuals who may be counted in both the number of people who have been vaccinated and those who have been infected.

With at least one vaccine dose administered to about 6% of the population and potentially a quarter of the population immune after infection, as many as about 1 in 3 people in the US may currently be at least partially protected against Covid-19.

That said, trial data shows that one dose of vaccine only offers partial coverage. And while some studies found that immunity to Covid-19 may last years after infection, others have found it may wane after just five months."
Two inmates who escaped an Arizona prison have been recaptured,"(CNN) Law enforcement officials on Thursday recaptured two inmates who escaped from a state prison in Florence, Arizona, over the weekend, thanks to tips from the public.

John Charpiot and David Harmon were captured after two people called authorities and said they had seen individuals who they believed were the missing fugitives, according to a news release on the Coolidge Police Department's Facebook page

They were subsequently arrested by police and US Marshals. The two men are now awaiting transport back to the Department of Corrections, according to Coolidge Police.

Charpiot and Harmon escaped Saturday night after they used a large air conditioning unit as a ram to break into a closet and steal tools used in their escape, law enforcement officials said in a news conference Monday.

The state and the US Marshals had offered up to $70,000 in rewards for information leading to their capture.

Here's what Biden's Obamacare executive order means for you,"(CNN) President Joe Biden has promised to make health care more affordable and available. His executive order Thursday takes one immediate step in that direction.

As a result of his action, the Department of Health and Human Services is set to reopen enrollment on the federal Affordable Care Act exchange between February 15 and May 15.

This would give Americans who missed the most recent sign-up period, which ended December 15, access to Obamacare policies -- and to federal assistance to pay for them. Roughly 15 million uninsured people could benefit, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Nearly 9 million of them could qualify for free or subsidized coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Individuals making up to about $51,000 and families of four earning up to about $104,800 are eligible for subsidies.

Some 36 states use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, for enrollment. But most, if not all, of the states that run their own marketplaces are also expected to launch special sign-up periods, according to a White House official."
WallStreetBets founder on stock frenzy: I'm enjoying this from the sidelines,"New York (CNN) The founder of the subreddit WallStreetBets says he never expected the forum to become the force it is now, with hordes of amateur investors driving up stock prices in a showdown with Wall Street short-sellers.

6 people killed after liquid nitrogen leak at Georgia food processing plant,"Gainesville, Georgia (CNN) Six workers were killed and several others were taken to a hospital after a liquid nitrogen leak Thursday at a poultry processing plant in Gainesville, Georgia, officials said.

Fire crews from Hall County and Gainesville responded to a report of burns at the Foundation Foods facility -- formerly Prime Pak Foods -- around 10:12 a.m. on Thursday, said Zachary Brackett of Hall County Fire Services.

Units arrived and found a large group of employees that had evacuated, along with multiple people who were experiencing medical emergencies in and around the facility, Brackett said. About 130 workers evacuated the plant.

Five men and one woman were killed, according to the Hall County Sheriff's Office, which identified the victims on Friday as Jose DeJesus Elias-Cabrera, 45; Corey Alan Murphy, 35; Nelly Perez-Rafael, 28; Saulo Suarez-Bernal, 41; Victor Vellez, 38: and Edgar Vera-Garcia, 28.

Their bodies have been taken to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab for autopsies, the sheriff's office said.

Matt Gaetz to rally Trump faithful to boost MAGA backlash in Liz Cheney's backyard,"(CNN) Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida will rally the Trump faithful in Wyoming on Thursday, hoping to bring a MAGA backlash to GOP Rep. Liz Cheney's backyard after she voted to impeach the former President for his role in inciting the riot at the Capitol.

The Republican party is now grappling with its future post-Trump, and some elected officials, like Gaetz, are positioning themselves as the bearer of his brand by attacking other Republicans like Cheney, who are hoping to move past it. Republican leaders have warned that the internecine fighting hurts the party.

""I have a competing vision for Republicanism,"" Gaetz told reporters this week. ""I believe that we ought to embrace the spirit and style of President Trump.""

Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, was one of only 10 Republicans to vote to impeach the former President. In a statement, Cheney blamed the violence at the Capitol on January 6 -- including the death of five people -- directly on Trump, saying he ""summoned,"" ""assembled"" and ""lit the flame of this attack.""

""There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" the Wyoming Republican said.

But Cheney's decision has sparked a retaliation in her deeply conservative home state, as Gaetz and other Republicans push her to step down from her leadership position as conference chair of the House GOP. Most Republicans still back the former President and 72% of Republicans continue to believe his falsehood that President Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election due to voter fraud, according to a recent Monmouth University poll.

A GOP state senator, Anthony Bouchard, has announced a 2022 campaign against Cheney. Over 50,000 people apparently signed a Change.org petition to ""recall"" Cheney. Donald Trump Jr., the former President's son, tweeted, ""with Republicans like Liz Cheney who needs Democrats?"" And the Wyoming Republican state party released a statement saying , ""There has not been a time during our tenure when we have seen this type of an outcry from our fellow Republicans, with the anger and frustration being palpable in the comments we have received.""

""Our telephone has not stopped ringing, our email is filling up, and our website has seen more traffic than at any previous time,"" the statement said. ""The consensus is clear that those who are reaching out to the Party vehemently disagree with Representative Cheney's decision and actions.""

Gaetz said that Cheney's ""principal job"" is to ""carry the message"" of her fellow House Republicans.

""Most of the members of the Republican conference don't believe that Liz Cheney speaks for them,"" he said.

A source in Cheney's office dismissed Gaetz's event as a publicity stunt. The source said that ""Rep. Gaetz can leave his beauty bag at home. In Wyoming, the men don't wear make-up."" The source linked to a video of Gaetz talking about putting make up on for a television appearance.

Cheney's allies have come to her aid. Former Republican Gov. Matt Mead joined a local newspaper op-ed touting her ""courage"" to perform her constitutional duty ""irrespective of the personal or political cost she might pay."" And Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso has defended Cheney as an effective member of their state's congressional delegation.

""Wyoming doesn't like it when outsiders come into our state and try to tell us what to do,"" said Amy Edmonds, a former state legislator and Cheney's former communications director.

House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has equivocated on his level of support for Cheney, saying she should remain in leadership but had "" concerns "" about her decision.

Gaetz said the only conversation he has had with McCarthy about his efforts to oust Cheney was after a recent television interview, when McCarthy asked him to stop referring to Cheney and others he was disagreeing with by name in light of the increase in death threats against members of Congress.

""I subsided referencing folks by name for about a day or two,"" said Gaetz. ""But after Liz became more, I think, problematic in her divergence from the perspective of the conference, it became untenable not to identify her as the key internal resistance within the Republican party to the American First Vision.""

Wyoming political observers said that Cheney, the daughter of the former Vice President Dick Cheney, would beat back the critical clamor.

""There's going to be pushback but I don't think it's anything she can't survive,"" said Wyoming University political science professor Jim King."
Man arrested with gun and 20 rounds of ammunition near US Capitol,"Washington (CNN) US Capitol Police on Wednesday afternoon arrested a West Virginia man who was armed with a handgun and 20 rounds of ammunition outside the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, which is near the US Capitol, a spokesperson from the Metropolitan Police Department said.

In court documents, authorities identify the man as 71-year-old Dennis Westover. According to a police affidavit, Westover had ""Stop the Steal paperwork"" with him ""that had a list of Senators and Representatives"" in both the US Congress and West Virginia state house, along with their contact information.

In an interview with Capitol Police detectives, Westover said that ""he was concerned about the honesty and integrity of the election.""

""He said we have some polar extremes of opinion in this nation and that while he believes there was election fraud at this point it is a moot point. He said that, 'The process I am engaged is righteousness, justice, and truth,' "" a police officer wrote about the interview.

Westover was ""animated"" and ""shouting"" at National Guardsmen on the inside of the perimeter surrounding Capitol Hill when police first approached him Wednesday, according to another police affidavit.

Pelosi slams Republican leadership for response to Marjorie Taylor Greene: 'What could they be thinking?',"(CNN) Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday slammed House Republican leaders for not doing more to rebuke GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia over her shocking rhetoric and past statements, saying the focus must be on leadership.

""What I'm concerned about is the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, who is willing to overlook, ignore those statements,"" Pelosi said at her weekly news conference, days after CNN reported Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians -- including Pelosi -- in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress. The statements were part a CNN KFile review of hundreds of posts and comments from Greene's Facebook page.

Greene is also facing criticism for a video of her confronting Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg before she was elected to Congress went viral Wednesday. And last week, other students who survived the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and families of the victims are calling for Greene's resignation, after comments surfaced that showed her agreeing with people who said the 2018 shooting was a ""false flag"" operation, remarks Pelosi called special attention to Thursday. The California Democrat also criticized Greene's placement on the House Committee on Education and Labor.

""Assigning her to the Education Committee when she has mocked the killing of little children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when she has mocked the killing of teenagers in high school at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school -- what could they be thinking?"" Pelosi asked Thursday. ""Or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing? It's absolutely appalling, and I think the focus has to be on the Republican leadership of this House of Representatives for the disregard they have for the death of those children.""

Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California said he plans to offer a privileged resolution for the expulsion of Greene from the House, which would require a two-thirds majority to pass. And Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said she is exploring the possibility of a resolution that would strip Greene of her committee assignments if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy doesn't remove her.

South Carolina detects first US cases of coronavirus strain first seen in South Africa,"(CNN) South Carolina officials have announced the United States' first two confirmed cases of a more contagious coronavirus strain first spotted in South Africa.

There is no known travel history or connection between the cases, both adults, according to a release Thursday from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.

Both cases were originally tested in early January, according to Dr. Brannon Traxler, the health department's interim public health director.

Traxler told reporters that both cases were tested by PCR ""very early in the month,"" are no longer contagious, and are doing well.

""It does take a while for sequencing to be done,"" Traxler added.

"An afternoon nap could improve your cognitive abilities, study says","(CNN) Taking an afternoon snooze could keep your brain sharp, a new study has said.

Adults ages 60 and older who took afternoon naps showed signs of better mental agility compared to those who didn't nap, according to a study published in General Psychiatry earlier this week.

Researchers analyzed napping habits in 2,214 older Chinese people and measured their cognitive abilities using several cognitive tests.

The participants were divided into two categories, those who took regular naps and those who didn't. The study defined naps as a period of sleep taken after lunch lasting between five minutes and two hours.

Nappers scored higher

Participants took the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, both of which test for memory, language and other cognitive abilities. Results showed that napping positively affected older adults' mental abilities, said lead study author Cai Han, geriatric psychiatrist at The Fourth People's Hospital of Wuhu in China.

In every category listed in the study, nappers tested statistically higher on average compared to their non-napping counterparts.

""This study found that a proper nap is beneficial to the maintenance of cognitive function, so we encourage the elderly to take a proper nap,"" Han said.

Unintentional nappers performed worse on the word recall test than non-nappers and intentional nappers, the study noted.

Many factors can affect sleep

Researchers did not gather data from people under 60, so a correlation cannot be drawn between afternoon napping and younger generations. The study also noted that there are conflicting studies about the benefits and risks of napping.

Sleeping behaviors can be affected by a multitude of factors, said Dr. David Neubauer, associate professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Daily routines, medication use, environmental factors, lifestyle choices and sleep disorders can all play a role in how frequently someone takes a nap, he said.

In the future, Han wants to study the effects of different lifestyles on cognitive function.

The study didn't gather specific data on the length of time each participant took a nap within the five-minute-to-two-hour range or what time in the afternoon they slept.

Here's how to power nap

Neubauer recommended taking a shorter ""power nap"" of up to 20 minutes to decrease the chances of transitioning into slow-wave sleep, which makes people feel groggy when they wake up.

Naps should also be taken earlier in the afternoon to limit their possible negative impact on the following night's sleep, he said.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Napping can be a healthy part of an older adult's day, Neubauer acknowledged, but make sure sleepiness isn't due to a treatable nighttime sleep disorder.

""Older individuals who want to do all they can to preserve their cognitive functioning should prioritize nighttime sleep,"" Neubauer said."

WallStreetBets founder on GameStop: There is no precedent for this,"The latest GameStopped company is American Airlines, the world's largest airline.

Thursday American was one of three US airlines - along with Southwest and JetBlue - report a record loss for 2020. American warned that its first-quarter loss will likely be worse than its fourth-quarter loss.

But shares soared pre-market following the report, at one point rising 87% before settling back down. Shares of American were up about 15% in early trading. Once again the rise appeared to be driven by posts on Reddit by some who hoped to drive up the price and put a squeeze on investors who bet against it by shorting it.

""AAL flying to moon?"" wrote one investor. ""Let's see if we are going to get some tasty juice out of a squeeze.""

Those investors have recently driven up the price of shares of GameStop (GME), another troubled money losing company. According to S3 Partners, about 19% of American shares are controlled by shorts. No other US airline has as much as 5% of its shares held by shorts.

American CEO Doug Parker declined to comment on the stock move in his call with analysts and media Thursday: ""As a rule, we don't speculate on the day-to-day movements of our share price. We'll stick to that rule today."""

Miami Heat lets dogs out to screen fans for Covid-19 -- but what does the science say?,"As AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami reopens to a limited number of fans Thursday, the Miami Heat is bringing out dogs it is billing as ""coronavirus detection dogs"" to screen guests and employees as they arrive at the facility. The team will be the first in the NBA to use canines to screen the public.

The science isn't yet clear whether dogs can, in fact, detect coronavirus infection in people. The team has been trying the dogs out on a smaller scale to screen personnel -- and ""we learned a lot during that time,"" Matthew Jafarian, Miami Heat's executive vice president for business strategy, told CNN.

Here's how the Miami Heat says the dogs work: Fans will line up in a screening area on socially distanced dots, keeping their hands at their sides. The dogs will walk past each person, sniffing them. If the dog keeps walking, you are clear to enter the arena.

If the dog sits next to you, the Miami Heat says, that signals to the handler that it might have detected Covid-19. A staff member will then help you and your party with a refund, and provide additional health and safety information -- but you and your party will not be allowed to enter the arena.

Jafarian said the Miami Heat view the detection dogs as just one tool in a much larger arsenal of Covid-19 safety measures -- which also includes a health screening questionnaire, a mandatory mask policy, cashless concession stands, not allowing food and drinks in the arena bowl, and physical distancing, among other tools.

Canine experts emphasize that while research on coronavirus detection dogs appears promising, it's not yet definitive. Studies exploring how reliable dogs are in detecting an active coronavirus infection remain ongoing -- and there are many questions left to answer.

""I think it's so new and novel that we have yet to determine how effective it is and how reliable the canines are at detecting these type of things,"" said Dr. Douglas Kratt, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association

""We're just such on the front edge of it,"" he said. ""But it is very exciting to see that we could have another tool in detecting coronavirus.""

A sniff of new research, but findings are not definitive

Early in the pandemic, the Miami Heat first explored using detection dogs -- along with other approaches -- to screen for the novel coronavirus in its facilities.

""During the NBA bubble is really when we started researching, in earnest, how we could bring back fans safely into the arena,"" Jafarian said, referring to the strict lockdown that NBA players and staff underwent last year as the ""bubble.""

""We looked at a variety of options. There were Breathalyzer tests that we looked at. We looked at traditional diagnostic tests, like rapid antigen and PCR tests. And we thought through operationally how we could administer that to hundreds and thousands of people coming into the building.""

Jafarian added that around that same time, some early studies were publishing out of Europe and elsewhere. The studies are unproven and published as pilot and proof-of-concept papers. When asked about the research not being definitive, Jafarian responded that he originally was skeptical, but found the studies ""compelling"" because they reached similar results. He said that the Miami Heat is taking its dog program ""very slowly"" until it learns more.

In July, researchers in Germany published a pilot study in the journal BMC Infectious Diseases describing how they trained eight dogs to discriminate between saliva samples from someone sick with Covid-19 and a healthy person.

The researchers reported in their study that among 1,012 samples, the dogs correctly identified 157 positive samples and 792 negative samples, but incorrectly identified 33 samples as negative and 30 samples as positive. The dogs ""achieved an overall average detection rate of 94%,"" the researchers wrote.

In December, a separate research team from France and Lebanon published a proof-of-concept study in the journal PLOS ONE detailing how they trained six dogs to tell the difference between underarm sweat from someone who has Covid-19 and someone who doesn't. Some of the dogs had a success rate of 76%, while others had a 100% success rate in that study.

But those studies were conducted in controlled environments and there was some repeated use of samples -- so it couldn't be ruled out whether a dog was memorizing the odor of a sample. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings might emerge in the real world, and among a larger group of detection dogs.

Elsewhere, in the United Kingdom, a team from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine has been training six dogs in the hope that they will be able to detect Covid-positive people -- even if the people have no symptoms.

""We saw what the airport in Finland was doing, and then an airport in Dubai, and [governments] in Mexico and Chile,"" said Miami Heat's Jafarian.

Then a couple of months later, a new company called SNIFF approached the Miami Heat with the offer to use detection dogs as a coronavirus screening tool in the team's arena.

Jafarian said, ""we decided to make a step forward.""

'The virus is new,' using detection dogs is not

Aron Shteierman, SNIFF's chief executive officer, told CNN that he has no background in dog training, but when the coronavirus pandemic began, he saw canines as a possible quick and non-invasive screening tool.

In the spring of last year, Shteierman turned his idea into a business: SNIFF. Next, he said that he contacted the company Global K9 Protection Group and asked to partner, specifically to use and train the company's dogs for coronavirus detection. Global K9 Protection Group agreed.

""The virus is new but the application of using a detection dog to screen people is not,"" Michael Larkin, vice president of commercial services at the Global K9 Protection Group , told CNN.

SNIFF and Global K9 Protection Group then reached out to the Miami Heat.

Shteierman confirmed ""we do not use live virus in order to train the canines,"" but he would not share specific details about the dogs' training process with CNN. He said it was ""proprietary"" information.

CNN was unable to vet the company's research behind the detection dogs, as well as the dogs' efficacy, because it hasn't been published yet. For that research, Shteierman said, ""We took the canines to a testing site where PCR testing was being done and we did comparison results.""

Yet the dogs do not substitute getting an actual diagnosis from a PCR test or medical professional, said the Global K9 Protection Group's Larkin.

""It's important for people to understand that this technology and this solution is evolving, and it doesn't replace going to a doctor or a PCR test,"" Larkin told CNN. ""The dog is designed to be an initial human body screening tool, but if there was a positive indication, our first recommendation would be go seek professional medical attention and get a PCR test.""

'Some level of evidence, but I don't think it's ironclad'

There are still significant questions.

For instance, some studies suggest that a dog handler's own bias can influence a detection dog's behavior. A 2011 study published in the journal Animal Cognition found that, among 18 handler-and-dog teams, a dog was more likely to erroneously ""alert"" it had detected a scent -- so give a false positive -- when the handler believed there was a scent present.

And when it comes to the coronavirus specifically, it remains unclear what exactly dogs could be picking up when they are trained to detect Covid-19.

In the two previous studies from Germany, France and Lebanon -- published in the journals BMC Infectious Diseases and Plos One -- both research teams posed that their dogs might be detecting the ""volatile organic compounds"" that are produced during coronavirus infections.

""It's not like the coronavirus has a smell. It's when a person is infected with a virus, their metabolism changes in such a way, their breath changes in such a way, that there are subtle changes that you can train dogs to detect. So it's not the virus they're detecting, it's physiological changes induced by the virus that they're detecting,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security , who was not involved in the studies, told CNN.

""That's likely what dogs are reacting to,"" he said. ""We know for other purposes, we use dogs that way for bomb-sniffing, for drugs, and they have tried to use them in cancer diagnosis . They've been trying to use them for C. diff diagnosis as well,"" which is the bacterium Clostridioides difficile that causes severe diarrhea and inflammation of the colon.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

2018 study suggests that a 3-year-old German Shepherd named Piper and 3-year-old Border Collie named Chase were able to detect the presence of C. difficile in stool samples that had been stored in a refrigerator with a sensitivity ranging from 77.6 to 92.6 and a specificity of 84.4 to 85.1.

Yet C. diff is a bacterium. There isn't much research on dogs detecting viral infections. One study, published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science in 2015, found that two trained dogs could discern between cultured cells infected with three different viruses -- but they were viruses that infect cattle, not humans.

Adalja said that more research on coronavirus-detection dogs is needed.

""There's starting to be some level of evidence, but I don't think it's ironclad,"" Adalja said. ""It's not definitive yet."""
Biden signs memorandum reversing Trump abortion access restrictions,"(CNN) President Joe Biden signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday to reverse restrictions on abortion access domestically and abroad imposed and expanded by the Trump administration.

The memorandum will ""reverse my predecessor's attack on women's health access,"" Biden told reporters during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.

He added that the measure ""relates to protecting women's health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made to Title X and other things making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to their reproductive rights.""

Biden's move fulfilled a campaign promise to rescind the so-called Mexico City Policy , a ban on US government funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions. The Trump administration reinstated the restriction in 2017 by presidential memorandum and then extended it to cover all applicable US global health funding. That made some $9.5 billion in aid for everything from HIV treatment to clean water projects and child immunizations contingent on groups agreeing not to discuss or perform abortions.

The memorandum also directs the Health and Human Services Department to immediately move to consider rescinding the Trump administration rule blocking health care providers in the federally funded Title X family planning program from referring patients for abortions , according to the Biden administration.

Taken together, the actions show an administration receptive to at least the initial requests of advocates eager to codify a new era of abortion protections after the prior administration took restrictions on the procedure to unprecedented levels.

Advocates for abortion restrictions slammed Biden over the announcement, which coincides with the eve of anti-abortion activists holding the annual March for Life event on Friday -- though this year it will be virtual. Former President Donald Trump made history in 2020 by being the first sitting President to participate in the event, which for decades has drawn large crowds of supporters each year to the National Mall.

The moves come as health care providers, reproductive rights groups and progressive lawmakers seek a more permanent end to longstanding barriers to the procedure.

Abortion access abroad

Beyond US borders, the impact of Trump's expanded Mexico City Policy, formally called ""Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,"" has ""really been devastating,"" said Melvine Ouyo, a Nairobi-based reproductive health nurse and former clinic director at Family Health Options Kenya. ""So many lives were lost.""

The policy, also known as the ""global gag rule,"" has been instituted by Republican administrations since President Ronald Reagan and repealed by Democratic ones. A State Department review published last year of the Trump administration's policy to bar funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions found it has also affected efforts to treat tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS as well as to deliver nutritional assistance, among other programs, and has had significant impact in sub-Saharan Africa.

Advocates and practitioners like Ouyo say the deaths result from the cuts to health care of all kinds for women, including access to contraception, which sends them in search of illegal, often unsafe and deadly abortions.

""This global gag rule has been one of the most detrimental policies to women's lives, especially women coming from marginalized communities,"" Ouyu told CNN. ""Biden really has a lot to do.""

Seema Jalan, executive director of the Universal Access Project and Policy at the United Nations Foundation, said advocates see an opportunity for the Biden administration to work with Congress to make broad changes. She cited the Helms Amendment — which bars US foreign aid for performing or promoting abortion, not just to foreign non-profits, but to governments, multilateral organizations and US non-profits — and the Hyde amendment, which imposes similar restrictions on groups within the US. The policies currently allow for abortions in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the pregnant person's life.

""There's the hard work of the administration working with Congress putting in place permanent solutions to harmful policy: addressing global gag, Helms, Hyde, and other technical fixes that are highly consequential,"" Jalan said.

Anti-abortion advocates, however, criticized the rollback, arguing it runs counter to Biden's professed efforts to bring the country together.

""Funneling U.S. tax dollars to abortion groups overseas is an abhorrent practice that flies in the face of the 'unity' Joe Biden and Kamala Harris promised to inspire,"" said SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser.

""Rescinding the Mexico City Policy on the eve of the March for Life is a deeply disturbing move, especially when the President says he wants national unity,"" March for Life president Jeanne Mancini said Thursday, adding that the government ""should work to protect the inherent dignity of all persons, born and unborn.""

Abortion access domestically

Biden's memorandum also deals with Title X, a federally-funded program that served about 4 million people a year prior to the abortion referral rule's implementation, according to HHS. The program provides resources including contraception, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and preventive education and testing for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV -- but not abortions.

In 2019, Trump's HHS issued a rule to bar health care providers participating in the program from offering abortion referrals, a policy that opponents argued would hit low-income people, rural residents, communities of color and the uninsured hardest. The rule prompted multiple federal court challenges and was ultimately blocked in federal court . But in July of that year, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the rule to go into effect despite the ongoing challenge against it.

The effects of the rule have been stark. Planned Parenthood — which previously covered 40% of Title X's patients and had been involved with the program since it began, according to the organization — withdrew from the program soon after the 9th Circuit decision. Additional clinics have dropped out of the program since the rule took effect, leaving six states without Title X providers, according to data from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 1,000 Title X sub-recipients and sites — approximately 25% of the 4,000 clinics in the program prior to the rule — have withdrawn from the program, per Kaiser.

National Right to Life President Carol Tobias lamented Biden's memorandum on Thursday.

""During the presidential campaign, Joe Biden made it clear that promoting abortion would be a priority in his administration and it would be done at the expense of taxpayers,"" Tobias, accusing him of dismantling ""domestic protections that have saved countless lives -- and put taxpayer money in the pockets of abortionists.""

Biden's memorandum, while a significant change of direction, represents just the beginning of advocates' goals of restoring the program.

""We expect some commitment toward repairing the program, rescinding the rule and getting longstanding providers back into the network so that services can be restored in parts of the country that have gone without Title X funding for so long,"" said Audrey Sandusky, communications director for the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA).

Around 1.5 million people lost access to Title X coverage after the rule was implemented, according to Sandusky. The group counts nearly three-quarters of Title X grantees among its membership of providers and administrators and worked with the Biden transition team and HHS staff on Title X's future, she said.

In light of how some ""patients have been in the dark"" after they were no longer able to get free or low cost health care from their usual providers, ""I would say it would take a long time for providers to regain the trust and confidence that patients have had in them,"" Sandusky said, as well as ""to regain trust in the federal government and to assure providers that they have support that they need from this administration and from Congress.""

In a call with reporters on Wednesday, Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson called rolling back the Mexico City Policy and the Title X abortion referral restriction ""a great start, one that will increase access and meaningfully impact people's lives, but I'll emphasize again, this is a start.""

When asked about conversations between Planned Parenthood and the Biden administration on Title X, McGill Johnson described ""very robust, and I would say, exciting conversations not just about the domestic gag rule but also thinking about how more investments can go into access to family planning and contraception, how to be more inclusive, how we can use policy to also engage men, to engage other populations.""

""We need to improve and modernize Title X,"" McGill Johnson said, later adding, ""making sure that it meaningfully reflects the sexual and reproductive health care needs of all patients.""

Beyond Biden's actions

Lawmakers, pointing to data that show the policies result in more unsafe abortions, more unwanted pregnancies, more maternal deaths and have a disproportionate impact on Black and brown women, say they are seizing the moment as well.

Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, chair of the House Appropriations Committee that oversees Title X funding, told CNN in an interview Wednesday that while she had not been in contact with the Biden administration on Title X, she's focused on returning the program to its prior form.

""What I'm committed to in Appropriations, because we have jurisdiction over Title X funding, is to work with the administration and the providers, those who were forced out of the program, to make sure that the funding is there for them to get back in,"" she said. ""Or work in that legislative direction, and to ensure there are safeguards to make sure that we can't have what the Trump administration tried to do here.""

When asked if she would seek to increase funding in this legislative session, DeLauro replied, ""I'm going to take a look at what we have by way of an allocation and so forth and, if I can, I will work to increase the funding.""

Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire is set to re-introduce on Thursday the Global HER Act, which would permanently repeal the Mexico City Policy. She said it was ""shameful"" that the Trump administration not only implemented it, but expanded it.

""I'm so relieved that President Biden has made rescinding this policy an early priority,"" Shaheen told CNN. ""The data doesn't lie. We know how detrimental this policy has been -- how it likely contributed to increased maternal deaths, unsafe abortions and compromised access to critical care. Rescinding this rule is the start but it is not enough -- there needs to be a permanent fix.""

And in the House, Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and others will reintroduce a bill to repeal the Helms Amendment. Also in their sights: the Hyde Amendment.

Access to reproductive health care and abortion, if needed, ""is central to women's independence, success and bodily autonomy,"" Schakowsky told CNN. ""If you cannot control reproduction for yourself, then you can never really plan your life.""

And some lawmakers, along with reproductive rights groups, are pushing Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to go further. The Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus is asking Biden to take immediate action on multiple fronts beyond repealing the Mexico City policy and reconsidering the Title X rule, including expanding US foreign assistance support for abortion care, rescinding an executive order that restricts abortion access under the Affordable Care Act, and directing the Health and Human Services Secretary to lift the Food and Drug Administration decision that an over-the-counter medication to safely end early pregnancy cannot be mailed during the pandemic.

Over 90 advocacy groups, including NFPRHA and Planned Parenthood, have presented the Biden administration with a ""Blueprint for Sexual and Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice"" calling for such actions and others, such as rescinding the Hyde Amendment.

Marcela Howell, president of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive Justice Agenda, which is one of the groups, told reporters Wednesday that lawmakers freely discussing abortion access contributed to their goals.

""The reality is that all of us have been fighting stigma around abortion, and if we cannot get the administration and members of Congress to actually use the word abortion care, then that furthers the stigma,"" she said. ""And we believe that it is a safe and legal procedure that women have accessed at various points in their lives and the stigma around it needs to be eliminated."""
Biden signs executive order to reopen Affordable Care Act enrollment,"(CNN) President Joe Biden is reopening enrollment on the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges as part of two health care executive actions that he signed Thursday, taking a step to help uninsured Americans that former President Donald Trump rejected.

It's Biden's first move toward delivering on his campaign promise to bolster the landmark health reform law that he championed as vice president. And it comes as more Americans could be facing the loss of coverage because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn.

""Today, I'm about to sign two executive orders that basically, the best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done,"" Biden said. ""There's nothing new that we are doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president.""

Open enrollment on the federal exchanges, which the Trump administration cut in half to six weeks, ended on December 15. But Biden has the power to reopen sign-ups, which will allow the uninsured to select policies under a special enrollment period.

Biden's order calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to reopen enrollment on healthcare.gov, which serves 36 states, to those who need coverage from February 15 until May 15. The agency did so on Thursday.

""As we continue to battle Covid-19, it's even more critical that Americans have meaningful access to health care,"" Biden said.

Trump refused to take this step last year, despite heavy lobbying from elected officials of both parties and the health care industry. Eleven states that run their own Obamacare exchanges, along with the District of Columbia, allowed their uninsured residents to obtain coverage outside the usual time frame. Most, if not all, are also expected to reopen their enrollment, a White House official said.

Soon after the President signed the executive order, California announced it would open its exchange from February 1 to May 15.

Thursday's executive orders focus on health care. Biden also signed measures aimed at strengthening Medicaid, as well as rescinding the so-called Mexico City Policy -- which bans the US government from funding foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions -- and reviewing the Title X abortion referral restrictions.

Biden has turned to executive actions in his first days in office to swiftly start putting in place his agenda and to wipe out that of his predecessor.

Reversing Trump administration directives

As part of Thursday's executive measures, Biden is directing federal agencies to reexamine a multitude of actions taken by his predecessor.

""He changed and made more inaccessible, more expensive and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items, the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid,"" he continued.

These include policies that weaken protections for people with preexisting conditions and that undermine the Obamacare exchanges or other health insurance markets.

He also wants agencies to review measures that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and that reduce affordability or financial assistance, including for dependents.

And the President is asking agencies to look at Affordable Care Act and Medicaid waivers and demonstration projects that the Trump administration approved or put in place that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements.

The agencies will also consider whether additional actions are needed to strengthen and protect access to health care.

Augmenting the Affordable Care Act

Increasing the number of insured Americans by strengthening the Affordable Care Act was at the heart of Biden's health care campaign promises. However, his two main measures -- creating a government-run public option and increasing Obamacare's federal premium subsidies -- will require Congress and face plenty of opposition.

The President included a proposal to boost Affordable Care Act subsidies so that consumers don't pay more than 8.5% of their income for coverage in his $1.9 trillion relief package , which is already facing hurdles on Capitol Hill.

Reopening enrollment is a much easier lift, though it's unclear how much impact it will have.

Anyone who loses job-based health insurance coverage is already eligible to sign up on the exchanges within 60 days of becoming uninsured. Enrollment in the first five months of 2020 jumped 46% compared to the same period the year before, the Trump administration said in June.

Also, more people have appeared to hold on to job-based coverage than expected, while those who have lost their employment and most of their income have turned to Medicaid. Between February and August, Medicaid enrollment jumped by more than 5.8 million people, or 9.1%, according to federal data released in late December.

During the most recent open enrollment period, overall Obamacare sign-ups for 2021 coverage increased when comparing the 36 states participating on the federal exchange both this year and last year -- the only time that happened under Trump. But the number of new consumers for 2021 slid somewhat.

Nearly 9 uninsured million people could get free or subsidized bronze plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges during a special enrollment period, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Wednesday. Bronze plans typically have lower premiums, but higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.

A total of about 15 million uninsured people could shop for coverage on the exchanges, Kaiser said.

Making the changes work

The key to reopening enrollment will be publicizing it and providing help for people to sign up, according to a recent Kaiser discussion with navigators who assist those looking for coverage on the exchanges. They also say the period should last more than six weeks.

The Trump administration slashed advertising by 90% and deeply cut funding for enrollment assistance -- two measures Biden is expected to reverse. Unspent revenue from exchange user fees appears to have accumulated to more than $1 billion over fiscal years 2018 to 2020, according to Kaiser.

Just over half of consumers who looked for coverage during the open enrollment period for 2020 coverage encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million folks sought in-person help but couldn't get it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Monday.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the federal exchange, said Thursday that it will spend $50 million on outreach and education, including advertisements on broadcast and digital platforms. The agency also will conduct an outreach campaign with community groups to raise awareness of the new opportunity to enroll in English, Spanish and other languages.

""The outreach budget for healthcare.gov was slashed dramatically during the prior administration,"" the White House official said. ""So folks who were uninsured weren't really given the opportunity to learn about the ability to get coverage. That's what we're aiming to rectify during this special enrollment period.""

Many health care moves expected

Thursday's measures will likely be the first of many efforts to bolster the Affordable Care Act and roll back Trump administration health care actions.

Among Biden's top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of Republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the Trump administration. It revolves around Congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid.

The case will continue even if the Justice Department under Biden withdraws, because it originated with Texas and other Republican-led states. But the President could work with the new Democratic majority in Congress to short circuit the GOP states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.

Biden's executive measures will also likely lead to the reversal of various measures the Trump administration put in place to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. These include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing Georgia to stop using the federal exchange , healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.

Biden's health care officials are also expected to focus on Medicaid.

The Supreme Court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in Arkansas and New Hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.

These measures run counter to Biden's promise to expand access to Medicaid so his administration will likely seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.

The Department of Health and Human Services is expected to take ""a very close look"" at the approvals involving work requirements, based on Thursday's executive order, the White House official said.

Also, Congress has limited states' ability to trim their Medicaid rolls during the public health emergency. The Biden administration may want to continue some of those provisions after it ends.

More than 700 dead pelicans found in Senegal World Heritage site,"Dakar Some 750 pelicans have been found dead in a UNESCO World Heritage site in northern Senegal that provides refuge for millions of migratory birds, the country's parks director said.

Rangers found the pelicans on January 23 in the Djoudj bird sanctuary, a remote pocket of wetland near the border with Mauritania and a resting place for birds that cross the Sahara Desert into West Africa each year.

An unverified video published on local media showed hundreds of pelican carcasses scattered on a beach, muddy and darker than their normally eye-catching white.

""We took some samples for screening and we hope in the near future to know what caused the death of the pelicans,"" Bocar Thiam, director of Senegal's parks, said in an interview.

The sanctuary is a transit place for about 350 species of birds but only pelicans were found dead, he said. Of those killed, 740 were juveniles and 10 were adults.

Robinhood to ease trading restrictions. GameStop stock soars 100%,"New York (CNN Business) GameStop traders sent the stock on a wild ride Thursday, and it looks set for another manic session Friday.

The stock lost more than 44% of its value on Thursday after surging nearly 40% at one point earlier in the day. Adding to the drama? The trading platform Robinhood restricted trading in the red hot stock as well as several others.

""We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only,"" Robinhood said in a statement, adding that it was also doing so forand three other stocks.

""Amid significant market volatility, it's important as ever that we help customers stay informed,"" Robinhood added.

The backlash was swift, and hours after implementing the restrictions, Robinhood said it would resume limited buys on those securities starting Friday. GameStop shares surged in premarket trading Friday, gaining 100% as of 4 a.m. ET.

""This was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to,"" Robinhood said in a blog post. ""We're beginning to open up trading for some of these securities in a responsible manner.""

GameStop GME Shares offell more than 60% at one point and were halted several times Thursday, after having soared in recent weeks because of support from individual investors on Reddit . The stock was flat about ten minutes after the market opened.

Wedbush ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF GAMR SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT Two exchange-traded funds with significant positions in GameStop plunged Thursday too. Theandboth fell about 10%, but each of them are still up more than 25% so far this year.

Despite the losses Thursday, GameStop shares are still up nearly 950% in 2021 -- surging from just under $20 at the end of 2020 to a current price of about $195. It's largely because of an army of investors who are buying the stock to hurt hedge funds that have bet against GameStop.

The phenomenon is called a short squeeze . An investor who thinks a stock will fall borrows the shares and sells them, with the hopes of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference before paying back the loan.

The problem is that a short seller can be hurt if the stock they borrowed keeps climbing. The losses, in theory, are infinite. So that creates another buying frenzy as short sellers rush to buy back the stock before it moves even higher.

A community on Reddit called Wall Street Bets has been leading the charge against the short sellers. Experts say that the rise of no-fee trading due to the popularity of online brokers such as Robinhood just makes it even easier for individual investors to keep plowing into GameStop stock.

The GameStop phenomenon has taken Wall Street -- and all of America for that matter -- by storm. The White House has said it is looking into the stock's massive surge. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell was asked about it during a press conference Wednesday.

It's unclear how much longer this short squeeze can last. Online brokerage TD Ameritrade, which is now owned by Charles Schwab, has started to limit trading in GameStop and other shares that have also gotten a pop from the Reddit crowd , such as movie theater chain AMC.

And Wells Fargo's financial advisory unit has banned employees from making recommendations to clients about GameStop and AMC.

The big concern is that average investors may be ignoring longer-term risks about GameStop as they look for a quick short-term pop.

Chewy CHWY Although the retailer reported decent holiday results and now has the backing ofco-founder Ryan Cohen, GameStop is still losing money as the sales of video games have increasingly shifted from buying a cartridge in a box at a physical store to a download model.

Where does the GameStop mania end?,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here

London (CNN Business) From Wall Street to the White House, everyone is watching GameStop shares .

What's happening: Stock in the left-for-dead video game retailer shot up an astonishing 135% to $347.51 on Wednesday, bringing gains since the start of January to 1,745%. In the battle between day traders coordinating on Reddit and legacy hedge funds betting GameStop shares will crash, the rag-tag internet crew is winning the day — at least for now.

It's not just aboutanymore. Shares ofand the shell of a bankrupt Blockbuster also soared Wednesday as emboldened small investors looked further afield.

Earlier this week, I wrote about how the spectacle has grabbed Wall Street's attention, forcing the old guard to reckon with how the democratization of investing through no-fee trading platforms like Robinhood is affecting market dynamics. There's plenty more to be said on that front. But for now, there's one big question: Just how does this episode end?

Shares of companies like GameStop and AMC Entertainment remain extremely volatile in premarket trading, leaving the immediate fate of the rally unclear. As of 7:35 a.m. ET, GameStop shares were up 37% to $475.

Outside of the United States, where stock in popular hedge-fund targets like Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield had also shot up, there were signs Thursday morning of retrenchment. Shares of the European shopping center owner shed almost 2% in Amsterdam on Thursday after gaining nearly 20% the previous session.

For the hedge funds and short sellers at the center of the melee, though, the damage is done. Melvin Capital closed out its position in GameStop this week after taking a huge loss, CNBC reports. Andrew Left of Citron Research said in a YouTube video posted Wednesday that he covered most of his GameStop shorts at ""a loss of 100%.""

Watch this space: So far, many on Wall Street are viewing the GameStop saga as a somewhat isolated event. But there are some concerns that damaged Wall Street money managers may need to sell other stocks they'd been planning to hold for the long-term — say in Apple, or Target — in order to cover losses. That could ripple through the broader market, which on Wednesday had its worst day since October thanks to concerns about Covid-19 vaccination efforts and the economy.

It's evident that investors are on edge. The VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, shot up nearly 62% on Wednesday, its third biggest one-day leap on records dating back to 2001. It retreated on Thursday but remains elevated.

Talk about whether regulators need to step in and limit this kind of behavior is also increasing — though for the folks at the Securities and Exchange Commission, it's not a clear-cut case. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for her part, is using the incident to renew her call for a Wall Street crackdown.

""For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement.

Apple, Facebook and Tesla had earnings, too

Apple AAPL Facebook FB Tesla TSLA On a normal day, all eyes would have been onand, which reported earnings after US markets closed Wednesday.

Apple's most recent quarter was a blowout thanks to sales of its new iPhone 12, with revenue hitting a record $111.4 billion — well above what Wall Street analysts had predicted.

Sales of iPhones grew more than 17% year-over-year to nearly $65.6 billion, feeding hopes that the company's earnings will be supercharged in 2021 by a flood of people rushing to upgrade their devices.

Facebook, meanwhile, said revenue rose 33% to roughly $28 billion during the quarter, showing the durability of its core advertising business despite the pandemic. When combining Facebook's various apps, including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, the company reported 3.3 billion monthly active users, an increase of 14% year-over-year.

Tesla told investors that it had notched its first full year as a profitable company , and vowed to increase sales growth by more than 50% in 2021.

""2020 was a defining year for us on many levels,"" CEO Elon Musk said. ""Despite a challenging environment ... we delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.""

Still, jittery investors don't appear impressed. Shares of Apple are down 1.7% in premarket trading, while Tesla's stock is 5% lower. Facebook shares also dipped.

Walmart ramps up its battle with Amazon using robots

Walmart WMT In an escalating race against Amazon,is sending in the robots.

The plan: To speed up customers' online delivery and curbside pickup orders, the company is building automated mini-warehouses in dozens of its stores, my CNN Business colleague Nathaniel Meyersohn reports.

There, bots will gather thousands of pantry items and frozen foods instead of employees. The items will then be brought to an area where Walmart workers can assemble them into orders for pickup or delivery.

Big picture: Walmart's plan comes as online ordering surges in the pandemic. Walmart's online sales, which include pickup and delivery, climbed 79% between August and October compared to the previous year. The prior quarter, online sales grew 97% from a year earlier.

Investor insight: Walmart's shares are up 24% in the past year, while Amazon's stock has rallied 77%. But on the whole, Wall Street has cheered Walmart's ambitious efforts to take on the internet behemoth.

Tom Ward, Walmart's US senior vice president of customer product, said on a call with reporters Tuesday that the centers would enable Walmart to fulfill curbside pickups and home deliveries within an hour. Those robots better work quickly.

Spain launches low-cost bullet train between Madrid and Barcelona,"(CNN) — Like many destinations around the world, Spain has been pretty much stopped in its tracks during the pandemic.

But the ambitious expansion of the European country's high-speed rail service appears to be going full speed ahead this year.

Spanish state operator Renfe's low-cost service Avlo will whisk passengers the 500 kilometers (300 miles) between Madrid and Barcelona in just two and half hours, with prices starting at €5 (about US$6).

The Avlo service, which travels at speeds of up to 330 kilometers an hour and has 438 seats, will begin operating four daily return journeys between the two Spanish cities from June 23.

While most journeys will take at least three hours, with additional stops in Guadalajara, Calatayud, Zaragoza, Lleida, Tarragona and Girona, the fastest trains will reach their final destination in around 150 minutes.

Renfe has converted its 112 high-speed trains for the new service, which had been scheduled to launch in April 2020.

However, this was delayed due to the coronavirus crisis.

Avlo's new launch date coincides with Renfe's 80th anniversary and the operator opted to mark the occasion by offering €5 tickets for journeys up until December. Standard prices range from €10 to €60 for a single journey.

Stiff competition

Tickets went on sale on Tuesday and, according to a statement on Renfe's official website , 100,000 were sold within 24 hours.

Avlo is essentially a cheaper alternative to Renfe's Alta Velocidad Española (AVE) network, which operates on the second longest high-speed rail network in the world after China's bullet train service.

It faces stiff competition from French state operator SNCF's Ouigo network , another low-cost high-speed rail service between Madrid and Barcelona, which is due to launch in May.

Ouigo's first 10,000 return tickets are to go on sale for just €1 each, while standard prices will begin at €9 each way.

As the two networks battle it out for customers, those who manage to snap up train tickets for journeys of more than 600 kilometers for €5 or less will surely feel like the real winners.

But while the future looks bright for Spain's high-speed rail service, the country has been hit hard by the pandemic and it's impossible to predict how things will pan out in the coming months.

Residents are currently only permitted to leave their homes to attend work, for education, to buy medicine, or care for elderly people or children, and masks are compulsory on public transport and in indoor public spaces."

Europe has a vaccine shortage. So why is it fighting with AstraZeneca?,"London (CNN Business) The European Union has been locked in a very public and acrimonious fight with AstraZeneca over vaccine delays.

The temperature may have cooled slightly after a meeting late Wednesday, which both sides said was constructive, but the problem hasn't been fixed yet and the stakes for EU countries are high.

These are the battle lines: AstraZeneca says it can't deliver as many doses as the European Union expected. The European Commission, which ordered the vaccine on behalf of EU member states, says this is unacceptable, and the drugmaker must find a way to increase supply.

The dispute is playing out against a dire backdrop. EU countries including Germany are running low on vaccines , the death toll is mounting, and the slow rollout of shots across the bloc is threatening a very fragile economic recovery from the pandemic.

What's the latest?

AstraZeneca AZN Tensions eased after Wednesday's meeting between AstraZeneca and EU officials. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said the discussion withCEO Pascal Soriot had a ""constructive tone,"" but she requested more information from the company on its deliveries.

""We regret the continued lack of clarity on the delivery schedule and request a clear plan from AstraZeneca for the fast delivery of the quantity of vaccines that we reserved for [the first quarter],"" she said on Twitter.

The British-Swedish company committed to closer coordination following the meeting.

""We had a constructive and open conversation about the complexities of scaling up production of our vaccine, and the challenges we have encountered. We have committed to even closer coordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months,"" a spokesperson said.

The numbers

The dispute began on Monday when EU officials said they had been told by AstraZeneca that production problems meant the company would supply ""considerably fewer"" doses in the coming weeks than had been agreed.

The European Commission has ordered 400 million doses on behalf of EU member states and is poised to start rolling them out across the bloc once the vaccine is approved, possibly this week.

""Pharmaceutical companies and vaccine developers have moral, societal and contractual responsibilities which they need to uphold,"" Kyriakides told reporters on Wednesday. ""The view that the company is not obliged to deliver [vaccines] ... is neither correct nor acceptable.""

The AstraZeneca vaccine is being administered in the United Kingdom. It is not yet approved in the European Union.

Pfizer PFE EU officials have declined to specify the scale of the AstraZeneca vaccine shortfall, and the company hasn't given details. But the shock development came as the European Commission was still trying to assess the impact ofslowing EU deliveries of the vaccine it developed with BioNTech while a manufacturing facility was upgraded.

What does AstraZeneca say?

Soriot told the Italian newspaper la Repubblica on Tuesday that AstraZeneca was not able to guarantee the timing of EU deliveries because countries such as the United Kingdom were quicker to finalize orders. There are also crucial differences in the EU and UK vaccine contracts.

""The contract with the UK was signed first and the UK, of course, said 'you supply us first,' and this is fair enough,"" Soriot said. Three months later, when the European Union wanted to be supplied ""more or less at the same time"" as the United Kingdom, AstraZeneca was not able to make that commitment.

""Our contract [with the European Union] is not a contractual commitment. It's a best effort. Basically we said we're going to try our best, but we can't guarantee we're going to succeed. In fact, getting there, we are a little bit delayed,"" he said.

The European Union has acknowledged it signed a ""best effort"" agreement with AstraZeneca.

It's not clear whether EU officials have any more cards to play regarding the contract dispute. One EU diplomat noted that the European Union has been quick to start legal proceedings in the past, and would be instructing lawyers now if it believed AstraZeneca had breached its contract.

Why can't AstraZeneca make more vaccine or divert supplies?

Soriot acknowledged in the interview that his company had experienced problems at one large manufacturing facility in Europe. He said the early phase of vaccine production is often ""complicated,"" and the company is ""basically two months behind"" where it wanted to be.

""Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume,"" said Soriot. ""We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small.""

Belgian authorities conducted an ""inspection"" of AstraZeneca's production facility in the country this week.

The goal of the inspection, which was requested by the European Commission, was ""to ensure that the delay in the delivery of the vaccines is indeed due to a production problem at the Belgian site,"" said a spokesperson for Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke.

AstraZeneca says it has built more than a dozen regional supply chains to produce its vaccine, collaborating with over 20 partners in more than 15 countries.

""Each supply chain was developed with input and investment from specific countries or international organizations based on the supply agreements, including our agreement with the European Commission,"" it said.

The European Union suggested on Wednesday that doses produced at AstraZeneca's plants in the United Kingdom should be used to fulfill its order. AstraZeneca says this can only happen once UK supplies have been delivered.

""As soon as we have reached a sufficient number of vaccinations in the UK, we will be able to use that site to help Europe as well,"" said Soriot.

Why are tensions so high?

The pandemic is still rampaging across Europe, and many countries are being criticized for slow vaccine rollouts.

Germany marked one year since the virus arrived on Wednesday, with the country showing no signs of reduced infections. Earlier this week, Portugal reported a record number of daily deaths in 24 hours. Strict lockdowns are in force in countries around the bloc.

Meanwhile, vaccine supplies in Europe are running desperately low.

The German government expects the country to face shortages in its supply of doses for at least another 10 weeks, Health Minister Jens Spahn said. The country has vaccinated only around 2% of the its population.

Germany's vaccine commission recommended on Thursday that the AstraZeneca vaccine not be given to people older than 65, citing a lack of data on its effectiveness in the age group, further complicating distribution plans in Europe's largest economy.

The situation is also dire in parts of Spain. The regional government of Madrid has decided to stop administering first doses of vaccines for the next two weeks due to growing uncertainty over the supply situation.

""We need more doses urgently,"" said regional vice president Ignacio Aguado.

The European Union and national governments are coming under huge pressure as a result.

""We are in a pandemic. We lose people everyday. These are not numbers, they are not statistics, these are persons, with families, with friends and colleagues,"" said Kyriakides.

Australian man escapes crocodile by prizing jaws off his head,"(CNN) A ""remarkably lucky"" Australian man who forced a crocodile off his head by prizing open its jaws with his bare hands has managed to escape with minor injuries, paramedics said.

The 44-year-old Queensland man fought off the creature while swimming at Lake Placid, near Cairns, on Thursday.

He had puncture wounds on each side of his face but was ""very, very calm"" when health care workers arrived to treat him.

""A crocodile had bitten his head, and in his effort to remove the jaws of the crocodile he put his hands in to try and prize the jaws apart,"" paramedic Paul Sweeney told reporters. ""In the process of trying to remove his hands, the jaws snapped shut on his forefinger. He's a remarkably lucky gentleman.""

""Just a few centimeters lower and we have major blood vessels ... had one of those been punctured, then it would have been a very different story,"" Sweeney said.

Europe's running out of vaccines,"A version of this story appeared in the January 28 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday

(CNN) Remember all that talk about vaccine solidarity? The spat over Covid-19 vaccine supplies is getting more embarrassing each day.

The European Union, which has long prided itself on rejecting nationalism in favor of international cooperation, is fighting an ugly battle with British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca over delays in supply, and threatening to impose export controls on vaccines.

AstraZeneca says the EU has been too slow to place orders while EU officials are pushing back against what they call ""the logic of first come first served."" European Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides lashed out, saying, ""That may work at the neighborhood butchers but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements.""

""We lose people everyday. These are not numbers, they are not statistics, these are persons ... pharmaceutical companies, vaccine developers, have moral, societal and contractual responsibilities which they need to uphold,"" she added.

EU officials have declined to specify the scale of the vaccine shortfall, but it's clear that it is large enough to cause problems. German Health Minister Jens Spahn warned today the country will face shortages for at least another 10 weeks. Italy had to revise its vaccination program, saying the over-80s would be vaccinated four weeks later than previously planned. In Spain, the regional government of Madrid has stopped administering first doses of the vaccine for the next two weeks to ensure there is enough to provide second doses for those who already got their first shots.

The EU isn't the only one scrambling for vaccines. In the United States, many states -- including New York, South Carolina, Hawaii and Florida -- have had to cancel or delay thousands of vaccination appointments because of supply shortages and the unpredictability of shipment sizes. One official described the current situation as the ""Hunger Games approach.""

Manufacturing and distributing hundreds of millions of vaccines from scratch was always going to be hard. But while the rich countries of the world fight over the supplies, the developing world is being left behind.

US President Joe Biden is aiming to have almost the entire US population vaccinated by the end of summer or early fall. The European Commission's goal is for 70% of adults to be inoculated by June. The UK is hoping to offer the vaccine to all adults by September.

Meanwhile, the People's Vaccine Alliance has estimated that nine out of 10 people in the world's poorest countries will miss out on the vaccine this year.

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.

Q: Why can't other companies manufacture the approved vaccines?

A: When asked about US President Joe Biden's use of the Defense Production Act, the nation's leading infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said the purpose was to ""facilitate"" the process of administering vaccines, and not to make more doses.

""You just can't open up another factory from a company that isn't Moderna, or isn't Pfizer, and say make mRNA vaccine. It's just not going to happen that way, because of the process. It's one that is difficult, in the sense of starting from scratch,"" Fauci told Anderson Cooper during a CNN Global Town Hall yesterday

Some cooperation is possible though. Sanofi said it will fill and pack millions of doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine from July in an effort to help meet the huge demand for the US drugmaker's shots.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

Could post-vaccine life mean we return to normal? Not just yet

The UK was the first country to begin inoculating its citizens with a fully vetted and authorized Covid-19 vaccine, and is among the countries with the highest number of shots administered per capita.

But just how quickly can the UK -- and perhaps the rest of the world -- expect to return to some form of normality? The truth is, not very soon, Kara Fox explains

Covid-19 numbers are dipping in the US, even as variants lurk and the vaccine rollout lags

Make no mistake: The United States still is at one of its worst spots of the coronavirus pandemic . Daily deaths are near a peak, and other daily stats are stunningly high compared to where they'd been before a late 2020 surge.

Yet Covid-19 cases and hospitalization numbers have been falling. Vaccines are here and warmer weather is approaching.

Manaus is collapsing again. Is a new coronavirus variant to blame?

Manaus, the capital city of Brazil's Amazonas state and its current coronavirus epicenter, is often referred to as the gateway to the Amazon, its main link to the rest of the world by plane or boat.

If the city's name sounds familiar, it could be because it was the scene of one of the world's worst Covid-19 outbreaks in April and May. Yet the current situation there is worse than ever -- and scientists tell CNN that evidence suggests a new virus variant mixed with government inaction created a tragic perfect storm.

"Poland abortion law: New restrictions go into effect, resulting in a near-total ban on terminations","(CNN) The Polish government has imposed a near-total ban on abortions, including the termination of pregnancies with fetal defects, delivering a major blow to pro-choice advocates in one of Europe's most devout Catholic countries.

The unexpected announcement that the ruling would take effect on Wednesday sparked nationwide protests, despite a ban on gatherings due to Covid-19 restrictions. On Thursday the government extended the restrictions a further two weeks until February 14.

More demonstrations against the ruling have been planned for Thursday and Friday in the capital Warsaw and towns across the country.

The ruling, which was handed down by Poland's constitutional tribunal court in October, states that abortions may only be permitted in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger.

That announcement sparked weeks of mass protests, some of the largest the country had seen since the Solidarity movement of the 1980s, which helped end Communist rule, analysts say.

India eases restrictions on public activities as Covid-19 cases show declining trend,"Punjab Police personnel stand in a queue as they wait register for Covid-19 tests at the Community Health Centre on the outskirts of Amritsar, India on January 25. Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty Images

India will allow swimming pools, cinemas, and large group gatherings of any size in areas outside of designated “containment zones,” the country’s Ministry of Home Affairs said in a new set of guidelines issued Wednesday.

The new rules are set to take effect from February 1 after a period of declining cases of Covid-19 in the country.

The ministry is expected to define operating procedures for these venues but cinemas will no longer be capped at 50% capacity and swimming pools will open to the general public instead of being reserved for athletes. States may decide to place additional restrictions if they deem it necessary to control the spread.

The limit on gatherings of 200 people indoors and caps based on the size of the outdoor space have been lifted.

The ministry added that a decision on changes to air travel will be taken in consultation with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, which has thus far been operating flights under bubble arrangements with countries and for repatriation missions.

While restrictions will be eased outside containment zones, the ministry has directed state governments to demarcate containment zones at the micro level and take all measures to encourage Covid-19 appropriate behavior.

""The number of active cases has been steadily declining over the last four months. However with a view to consolidate the substantial gains that have been achieved against Covid-19, and to fully overcome the pandemic, there is a need to maintain caution,"" the ministry said in its order.

Cases and vaccinations: On Thursday, India reported 11,666 new coronavirus infections, bringing its total to 10,701,193 with 153,847 deaths. India has vaccinated 2,328,779 healthcare workers as of Wednesday, according to the Ministry of Health."

Rural medical center suspended from vaccination program after inoculating school district staff,"(CNN) A rural Georgia medical center has been suspended from the state's Covid-19 vaccination program for six months after the facility administered vaccines to staff of the local school district.

The Georgia Department of Public Health was notified Tuesday that the Medical Center of Elberton had been vaccinating Elbert County School District staff members who were outside of the Phase 1A+ category of people eligible for the vaccine. After an investigation, the DPH confirmed the information and suspended the medical center, a release from the department said.

CNN has reached out to the Medical Center of Elberton for comment.

Elbert County School Superintendent Jon Jarvis said many of the district's more than 500 employees have been eager to receive the vaccine.

""It's hard to wear a mask when you're trying to teach students sounds,"" Superintendent Jarvis told CNN affiliate WXIA. ""The vaccination for teachers, bus drivers, school nutrition workers ... they should be considered in the first group in my opinion.""

"Alexey Navalny to remain in detention ahead of hearing next month, Russian court rules","Moscow (CNN) A Russian court rejected an appeal Thursday to overturn the 30-day detention of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny ahead of a hearing next month over whether he should face jail time for a years-old fraud case.

Navalny appeared by video link at the court in the city of Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow. He continues to be held at the Matrosskaya Tishina detention center, in the northeast of the capital.

The opposition activist was ordered to spend 30 days in custody during a surprise hearing on January 18.

He'd been detained a day earlier following his arrival from Germany , where he spent five months recovering from Novichok poisoning he blamed on the Russian government. The Kremlin repeatedly denied any involvement.

Navalny was placed on the country's federal wanted list last month for breaching the terms of probation related to the 2014 fraud case, which he dismisses as politically motivated.

His next court date is currently scheduled for February 2, when a court will decide whether his three-and-a-half-year suspended sentence on fraud charges should be converted into a jail term due to what Russian authorities say is the violation of the terms of his suspended sentence.

The judge in Thursday's appeal hearing ruled that Navalny's detention was lawful and that the opposition leader would remain in detention.

Navalny's reaction on hearing the decision suggested he was expecting it. ""Everything was clear to me even before the hearing,"" he told the court.

The politician had earlier complained about violations of legal procedures and a lack of opportunity to communicate with his lawyers since his detention on January 17.

""Everything is so amazing here that I don't even know where to start. As usual it works: you take a court decision, look for violations of the law and speak about them when appealing. And here everything is one big violation of the law,"" Navalny said.

In his final statement, Navalny urged protesters to keep coming out.

""They are the last barrier that prevents those in power from stealing everything. They are the real patriots,"" he said. ""You will not be able to intimidate us -- we are the majority.""

Navalny's lawyer, Olga Mikhailova, told reporters outside the court that this had been his legal team's first opportunity to have ""a more or less confidential talk with Navalny"" since his detention at the airport.

""We will absolutely appeal against this decision at the Court of Cassation and at the European Court. We believe that everything that is happening to Alexey is happening for political reasons -- in order to rule out his political activities,"" she said.

Russian law enforcement conducted searches Wednesday at Navalny's Moscow apartment and his team's headquarters, according to his aides.

The raids came as Navalny's allies called for a second round of unsanctioned nationwide demonstrations, planned for Sunday, to demand the activist's release from detention.

Last weekend, tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets, resulting in nearly 4,000 detentions, according to monitoring group OVD-Info.

People clash with police during a protest against the jailing of Navalny in St. Petersburg, Russia, on January 23, 2021.

Tycoon urges US pressure on Putin

Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon who was once Russia's richest man, spent more than 10 years in a Russian jail after falling out with Putin.

Speaking to CNN from exile in London, he urged US President Joe Biden to put pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle to help save Navalny from a similar fate.

""Personal sanctions must be imposed by President Biden and others in the West on those closest to Putin,"" he told CNN. ""This would be extremely painful for Putin's entourage and will affect the stability of his power.""

Khodorkovsky ran Russian oil giant Yukos until 2003. He was later convicted of tax evasion and fraud -- charges he argued were politically motivated -- and jailed.

""Looking back, I was one of the lucky ones. I lost a decade of my life in prison but others who challenge Putin have paid a far higher price,"" he told CNN.

That list includes Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia's most prominent journalists and Kremlin critics. She was shot dead in 2006. There have been numerous arrests, two trials and five convictions, including of three Chechen brothers, but it is still unknown who ordered her murder. The Kremlin denies any connection with the killing.

In 2015, Russia's former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov, then the most visible leader of the Russian opposition, was gunned down on a Moscow bridge within sight of the Kremlin. Five Chechen men were jailed for his killing in 2017.

Former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko died in 2006 after being poisoned with a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210. A UK inquiry concluded in 2016 that Putin probably approved the operation by two Russian agents to kill the ex-spy. Russia dismissed the UK inquiry as politically motivated.

US has 'deep concern' for Navalny'

The US State Department has called on Russia to free all those arrested at protests in the country over the weekend and for the immediate and unconditional release of Navalny.

US Secretary of State Tony Blinken said Wednesday that the Biden administration was conducting a review of Russian ""actions that are of deep concern to us, whether it is the treatment of Mr. Navalny and particularly the apparent use of a chemical weapon in an attempt to assassinate him.""

Biden spoke to Putin on Tuesday for the first time since becoming US President, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, and raised the poisoning of Navalny, among other issues.

""I don't want to get ahead of where we are on those reviews,"" said Blinken. ""But as I say, we have a deep concern for Mr. Navalny's safety and security, and the larger point is that his voice is the voice of many, many, many Russians, and it should be heard, not muzzled.""

Blinken told reporters he was ""not ruling out anything but we want to get this full review done, and then we'll take it from there.""

He also reiterated his comments from his Senate confirmation hearing that ""it remains striking to me how concerned, and maybe even scared the Russian government seems to be of one man, Mr. Navalny."""

Full moon in January 2021: When to see the Wolf Moon,"(CNN) The first full moon of the year will light up the night sky on Thursday. The moon will be 100% full at 2:16 p.m. ET.

Barring clouds or bad weather, it will be visible around the world. The Virtual Telescope Project will stream the full moon live as it rises over the skyline of Rome.

Each moon has its own name associated with the full moon. In January, it's often called the ""wolf moon,"" supposedly inspired by hungry wolves that howled outside of villages long ago, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac

But that may not actually be the case, according to EarthSky.org and a 2013 article it cites published in Indian Country Today

Some tribes have described it as the ""cold moon"" or the ""hard moon,"" but not the wolf moon, according to a list of full moon names attributed to 29 tribes at the Western Washington University Planetarium website

The closest is the Sioux name for the January full moon, which is ""wolves run together."" This is similar to the Cheyenne name for the December full moon, ""when the wolves run together.""

The list was compiled by Phil Konstantin, a former NASA employee and member of the Cherokee Nation.

Although others have attributed the wolf moon moniker to the Algonquin tribe, they refer to the January full moon as ""squochee kesos"" or ""sun has not strength to thaw.""

Some other names for the January full moon include the bear hunting moon for the Haida tribe in Alaska, ""moon of life at its height"" for the Hopi tribe in Arizona and even ""atalka,"" which means ""stay inside"" for the Kalapuya tribe in the Pacific Northwest.

Typical of a normal year, 2021 will also have 12 full moons. (Last year had 13 full moons, two of which were in October).

Here are all of the full moons occurring this year and their names, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac

February 27 -- Snow moon

March 28 -- Worm moon

April 26 -- Pink moon

May 26 -- Flower moon

June 24 -- Strawberry moon

July 23 -- Buck moon

August 22 -- Sturgeon moon

September 20 -- Harvest moon

October 20 -- Hunter's moon

November 19 -- Beaver moon

December 18 -- Cold moon

Be sure to check for the other names of these moons as well, attributed to the different Native American tribes.

Here is what else you can look forward to in 2021.

Meteor showers

There is a bit of a wait until the next meteor shower, the popular Lyrids in April. The Lyrids will peak on April 22 and will be best seen in the Northern Hemisphere -- but the moon will be 68% full, according to the American Meteor Society

The Eta Aquariids follow soon after, peaking on May 5 when the moon is 38% full. This shower is best seen in the southern tropics, but will still produce a medium shower for those north of the equator.

The Milky Way is seen from the Glacier Point Trailside in Yosemite National Park, California.

The Delta Aquariids are also best seen from the southern tropics and will peak between July 28 and 29 when the moon is 74% full.

Interestingly, another meteor shower peaks on the same night -- the Alpha Capricornids. Although this is a much weaker shower, it has been known to produce some bright fireballs during the peak. And it will be visible for those on either side of the equator.

The Perseid meteor shower, the most popular of the year, will peak between August 11 and 12 in the Northern Hemisphere when the moon is only 13% full.

Here is the meteor shower schedule for the rest of the year, according to EarthSky's meteor shower outlook

October 8: Draconids

October 21: Orionids

November 4 to 5: South Taurids

November 11 to 12: North Taurids

November 17: Leonids

December 13 to 14: Geminids

December 22: Ursids

Solar and lunar eclipses

This year, there will be two eclipses of the sun and two eclipses of the moon -- and three of these will be visible for some in North America, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac

A total eclipse of the moon will occur on May 26, best visible to those in western North America and Hawaii from 4:46 a.m. ET to 9:51 a.m. ET.

An annular eclipse of the sun will happen on June 10, visible in northern and northeastern North America from 4:12 a.m. ET to 9:11 a.m. ET. The sun won't be fully blocked by the moon, so be sure to wear eclipse glasses to safely view this event.

November 19 will see a partial eclipse of the moon, and skywatchers in North America and Hawaii will see it between 1 a.m. ET and 7:06 a.m. ET.

And the year ends with a total eclipse of the sun on December 4. It won't be seen in North America, but those in the Falkland Islands, the southern tip of Africa, Antarctica and southeastern Australia will be able to spot it.

Visible planets

Skywatchers will have multiple opportunities to spot the planets in our sky during certain mornings and evenings throughout 2021, according to the Farmer's Almanac planetary guide

It's possible to see most of these with the naked eye, with the exception of distant Neptune, but binoculars or a telescope will provide the best view.

Mercury will look like a bright star in the morning sky from February 28 to March 20, June 27 to July 16, and October 18 to November 1. It will shine in the night sky from January 15 to January 31, May 3 to May 24, August 31 to September 21 and November 29 to December 31.

Venus, our closest neighbor in the solar system, will appear in the eastern sky on the mornings of January 1 to 23 and in the western sky at dusk on the evenings of May 24 to December 31. It's the second brightest object in our sky after the moon.

Mars makes its reddish appearance in the morning sky between November 24 and December 31 and will be visible in the evening sky between January 1 and August 22.

Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is the third brightest object in our sky. It will be on display in the morning sky between February 17 and August 19. Look for it in the evenings of January 1 to 9 and August 20 to December 31 -- but it will be at its brightest from August 8 to September 2.

Saturn's rings are only visible through a telescope, but the planet itself can still be seen with the naked eye on the mornings of February 10 to August 1 and the evenings of January 1 to 6 and August 2 to December 31. It will be at its brightest between August 1 to 4.

Binoculars or a telescope will help you spot the greenish glow of Uranus on the mornings of May 16 to November 3 and the evenings of January 1 to April 12 and November 4 to December 31 -- but at its brightest between August 28 to December 31.

And our most distant neighbor in the solar system, Neptune will be visible through a telescope on the mornings of March 27 to September 13 and the evenings of January 1 to February 23 and September 14 to December 31. It will be at its brightest between July 19 and November 8."
"Shark and ray populations have dropped 70% and are nearing 'point of no return,' study warns","(CNN) Some species of sharks and rays could disappear from our seas altogether after a sharp drop in their numbers due to overfishing in the past 50 years.

A study published Wednesday in the journal Nature found that shark and ray populations fell by 71.1% from 1970 to 2018.

""Knowing that this is a global figure, the findings are stark,"" said Nick Dulvy, a biologist at the Simon Fraser University and a co-author of the study. ""If we don't do anything, it will be too late. It's much worse than other animal populations we've been looking at.""

Of all 31 species of oceanic sharks and rays, 24 are now threatened with extinction, several of which are classed as critically endangered -- the highest threatened category.

""It's an incredible rate of decline, steeper than most elephant and rhino declines, and those animals are iconic in driving conservation efforts on land,"" Dulvey said.

In the study, researchers used two major biodiversity indicators -- the Red List Index, a list measuring extinction risk, and the Living Planet Index, a dataset measuring changes in population abundance -- to map out the rate of change of species populations over the decades.

Their results revealed ""an alarming, ongoing, worldwide decline in oceanic shark populations across the world's largest ecosystem over the past half-century, resulting in an unprecedented increase in the risk of extinction of these species,"" said the study.

Factors like human disturbances and climate change place pressure on these species -- but overfishing is by far the largest threat, and relative fishing pressure (which takes populations into account) has increased 18-fold since 1970, the study found.

Sharks in particular are fished for their meat, fins, gill plates and liver oil -- they were so heavily hunted during the peak of overfishing in the early 2000s that between 63 million and 273 million sharks were killed every year, the study found.

In Asia, shark fin is a prized ingredient for shark fin soup, long viewed as a status symbol at Chinese dinners and banquets. A 2018 study in the journal Marine Policy found that in Hong Kong, the ""world's biggest shark trading hub,"" shark fin imports have doubled since 1960.

Sharks are also particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation due to their low population growth rates and long generation times -- in some shark species it can take several years, even decades between the birth of an individual and the birth of its first offspring. Rays, too, have faced rapid depletion and local extinction due to overfishing in their historical habitats.

There are some encouraging signs for specific species -- the white shark, which had seen a population crash in the 20th century, is now showing signs of recovery in several regions thanks to government bans and policies, the report said. Hammerhead sharks are also rebuilding their populations in the Northwest Atlantic, due to strict quotas in US marine territories.

However, the threat of overfishing far outpaces any trade regulations or sustainable fisheries management, researchers warned.

Few countries have imposed catch limits specific to oceanic sharks, and fewer yet have been able to rebuild populations that were shattered by overfishing in the past century. Despite governments signing international treaties, weak implementation has failed to effectively restrict trade or retention of these species, the report said.

""We can see the alarming consequences of overfishing in the ocean through the dramatic declines of some of its most iconic inhabitants,"" said Nathan Pacoureau, the paper's lead author.

""It's something policy makers can no longer ignore. Countries should work toward new international shark and ray protections, but can start immediately by fulfilling the obligations already agreed internationally.""

The study urged immediate reform to ""prevent shark population collapses"" and the potentially disastrous consequences for their ecological systems.

Specifically, researchers called on governments to adopt catch limits for oceanic sharks that can support sustainable fisheries, and bans on shark or ray retention -- actions that are crucial to saving these shrinking populations ""before depletion reaches a point of no return."""

""We are experiencing technical difficulties based on unprecedented scale as a result of the newfound interest,"" said a message on the WallStreetBets subreddit , adding that enforcement of the forum's rules and Reddit's content policy became increasingly difficult. ""WSB will be back,"" the moderators added.

The subreddit exploded onto the investment scene earlier this week when aggressive touting of GameStop's stock by several of its members sent the video game retailer's shares soaring more than 400% this week. The actions appear to have helped fuel a so-called short squeeze instock, where investors who had used options to bet against the stock needed to cover those bets by buying shares.

The Reddit community wallstreetbets briefly went private Wednesday night, according to a statement on the site.

WallStreetBets has since turned its attention to other stocks, with movie theater chainspiking more than 300% on Wednesday.

In a post soon after making WallStreetBets public again Wednesday evening, the moderators outlined their struggle to manage the group's surging popularity.

""We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad nights sleep,"" they said. ""We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators.""

The moderators also said several Twitter accounts were trying to impersonate them.

""@wsbmod is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.""

While it was private, a subreddit called WallStreetBetsnew, meanwhile, gained more than 100,000 followers in around 30 minutes on Wednesday evening. That subreddit was established in March last year. On it, users urged their peers not to panic. Others encouraged buying even more stocks in revenge for the outage.

""REVENGE BUY TOMORROW! THEY SHOOK THE WRONG TREE! LETS GET IT GOING TOMORROW MORNING BOYS,"" one user posted

Reddit told CNN Business that the moderators of WallStreetBets chose to take the forum private, and the company was not involved in the decision.

"Democratic House staffers draft letter to senators on impeachment: Convict Trump 'for our sake, and the sake of the country'","(CNN) A group of Democratic House staffers are drafting what they hope will be a bipartisan message to the Senate about the upcoming impeachment trial, urging senators to take the trauma their aides experienced during the violent insurrection in the Capitol on January 6 seriously, a staffer tells CNN.

""We are staff who work for members of the U.S. House of Representatives, where it is our honor and privilege to serve our country and our fellow Americans. But on January 6th, 2021, our workplace was attacked by a violent mob trying to stop the Electoral College vote count,"" the draft of the letter reads.

In an effort to make the letter appeal to Republican staffers as well, its drafters organized the signatures so staffers can sign on with just their email addresses, leaving off the offices of the members of Congress they work for.

The letter squarely blames former President Donald Trump for inciting the attack.

""As employees of the U.S. House of Representatives, we don't have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our Senators do. And for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again,"" the letter states.

Florida officials investigating deputy allegedly seen in video taking student to the ground,"(CNN) A Florida school resource officer is on paid administrative leave after a video surfaced of him taking a high school student to the ground.

The incident with a school resource officer took place Tuesday at Liberty High School in Kissimmee, Florida, according to the Osceola School District. A brief video posted Tuesday, which has been widely circulated online, shows what appears to be an Osceola County Sheriff's school resource officer in a confrontation with a student at the school.

School Resource Officers are not school district employees, according to the district, but rather they are sworn sheriff deputies employed with their law enforcement agency. The Sheriff's Office has removed the resource officer who was involved in the incident from the school until the outcome of their investigation, District Public Information Officer Dana Schafer said.

In the video, the deputy is seen taking a student to the ground and placing handcuffs on her. Another deputy is seen in the video as the incident unfolds. During a press conference on Wednesday, Osceola County Sheriff Marco Lopez said there are other videos apart from the partial one ""floating around,"" saying ""that's why I'm not going to express an opinion on what may or may not have happened.""

While it's not clear from the short video what led up to the incident, Lopez said the disruption occurred at a school function where the student was not complying with lawful commands and ""went after"" another student. Lopez said the situation escalated from there.

"Just as Covid-19 numbers were dropping, a concerning strain detected in South Africa is now in the US","(CNN) Hope stemming from decreasing Covid-19 numbers has been blunted by the spread of new coronavirus variants .

Now, one of the most worrisome strains -- first found in South Africa -- has been detected for the first time in the US.

On Thursday, South Carolina officials confirmed two cases of the more contagious strain, also known as B.1.351

Those two people, both adults, have no known travel history or connection to one another, state health officials said.

This strain has concerned scientists because it seems to more transmissible than other versions of the virus, and because it might evade some of the immune protection offered by antibodies.

Experts say they believe vaccines will still be effective against the variant, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said ""we have no evidence that infections by this variant cause more severe disease.""

But this particular strain ""troubles me,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

""When you look at the vaccines that we have available now, the neutralizing antibodies that they induce ... when you measure that against the South African isolate, it is diminished by multifold in its ability to cover it,"" Fauci told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Thursday.

""It's still within the range of what you predict would be protective. But I take no great comfort in that.""

And for anyone getting lax about safety precautions, the confirmation of the B.1.351 strain in the US should be a big wake-up call.

""The arrival of the SARS-CoV-2 variant in our state is an important reminder to all South Carolinians that the fight against this deadly virus is far from over,"" said Dr. Brannon Traxler, interim public health director for the state's health department.

The variant has been detected in more than 30 other countries, according to the World Health Organization.

The sobering news comes as health officials stress the need to wear masks, even after vaccination.

Why we're at a critical time

A highly contagious variant first spotted in the UK have been detected in at least 28 states, according to the CDC.

And Minnesota officials recently announced the first US case of another variant that was first detected in Brazil. That person had recently traveled from Brazil.

""The variants that have been identified recently seem to spread more easily,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said.

""They're more transmissible, which can lead to increased number of cases and increased stress on our already overtaxed system.""

With several days still left to go, January has already been the deadliest month of the entire pandemic in the US, with more than 80,000 deaths.

In less than one year, Covid-19 has claimed more than 430,000 US lives . And a composite forecast by the CDC projects another 84,000 deaths by February 20.

Why some vaccines are 'sitting on the shelves'

A total of 26,193,682 doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered, according to data published Thursday by the CDC. That's about about 54% of the 48,386,275 doses distributed.

Nearly 21.7 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine and almost 4.3 million people have been fully vaccinated, CDC data shows.

Some of the 48 million doses distributed just arrived in states, while others are still going through a dayslong distribution process to make it to their final destination, she said.

""So there is some delay from the time that they're distributed and to the time that they could possibly be administered,"" Walensky said. There's also a delay in reporting the administrations, she said.

""And then there are some doses that we need to make sure, for the four- or five-day window that we give people in order to get their second shot ... we need to make sure that that's available for them when they return for their second shot,"" she added.

But even with those considerations, there are still ""millions"" of doses left ""sitting on the shelves,"" she said. ""That's one of the bottlenecks and one of the ways that we have to get resources to the states, to make sure that they can quickly administer the vaccines that are on their shelves,"" she said.

Ohio has set aside portions of its vaccine supply specifically for vaccinating the state's K-12 staff, allocating around 55,000 vaccines to schools every week, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Thursday.

DeWine said the state is trying to do two things at once: continuing to vaccinate older Ohioans in February, while keeping school vaccinations on track.

""This plan that we have will allow most of the K-12 staff in a county to be vaccinated within seven days,"" DeWine said.

Service members and retirees might help with vaccinations

Service members could be deployed at up to 100 sites nationwide to help boost administrations, a FEMA spokesperson said.

The federal government is also amending rules to help broaden the list of people who can administer vaccines, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said Wednesday.

The Department of Health and Human Services ""will amend the current Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act -- otherwise known as the PREP Act -- to permit doctors and nurses who have recently retired or become inactive to administer shots and to permit anyone currently licensed to vaccinate in their state to administer shots across state lines,"" Zients said.

No signs of major safety concerns with vaccines

Severe allergic reactions to vaccines, known as anaphylaxis, are not a problem, Walensky said.

""Based on our most recent data ... we found that there were 2.1 cases of anaphylaxis per million administered doses of Moderna, and 6.2 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses administered of Pfizer,"" she said during a White House Covid-19 response team briefing.

""Let me be clear: These are rare treatable outcomes, and the Covid-19 vaccines are safe,"" she said.

It's also important to put the numbers into context and consider that the risk of getting sick with the virus is ""much higher"" than the risk of allergy from the vaccine, the CDC director added.

Other mild side effects, like pain in the arm, fatigue and muscle aches after the shot are ""all normal and expected,"" Walensky said.

In fact, they're usually a good sign, the CDC director said.

""These symptoms mean that your immune system is revving up, and the vaccine is actually working."""
Pakistan's top court rules to free men previously convicted of kidnapping and murdering Daniel Pearl,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) Pakistan's Supreme Court has ruled that four men convicted of kidnapping and murdering American journalist Daniel Pearl should go free, a move described by the White House as an ""affront to terrorism victims everywhere.""

Pearl was working as the South Asia bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal in 2002 when he was kidnapped in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, while reporting on Richard Reid , the British terrorist known as the ""shoe bomber.""

The high profile abduction drew international attention amid growing concern over the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism.

Assailants later filmed Pearl's beheading and sent it to United States officials. It was among the first propaganda videos targeting hostages created by extremists, and helped to inspire other terror groups to film horrific and egregious acts of violence.

Four men were arrested in 2002, and convicted of the kidnap and murder of Pearl. One, British national Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, was given the death penalty.

"Corky Lee, legendary Asian American photographer, dies at 73","Jessie Yeung , CNN Written by

Corky Lee, an award-winning photographer who captured the everyday lives and political activism of the Asian American community, has died at the age of 73 after battling Covid-19.

""It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Corky (Young Kwok) Lee,"" said a statement from Lee's family on Wednesday evening. ""Corky, as he was known to the Asian American community, was everywhere. He always had a camera around his neck, documenting a community event, capturing a social injustice for the record and even correcting the social injustice of an historical event that took place well over a century ago. He did what he loved and we loved him for it.

""(Corky) had a very unique lens. His passion was to rediscover, document and champion through his images the plight of all Americans but most especially that of Asian and Pacific Islanders,"" the statement added. ""He has left us with what is likely to be the single largest repository of the photographic history of Asian Americans of the past half century.""

Lee first began experiencing Covid-19 symptoms on January 3, and was hospitalized on January 7, according to a family statement on a Facebook fundraiser page. He was moved to the ICU on January 11.

He is survived by his brother and sister-in-law, his elder sister's husband, and both siblings' children, according to the family's statement.

Lee was born to two Chinese immigrants in Queens, New York. Dubbed the ""Unofficial Asian American Photographer Laureate,"" he documented Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in vivid, intimate detail over his 50-year career.

His photography began in junior high, when he saw a famous 1869 photograph commemorating the completion of the transcontinental railroad, according to the Asian/Pacific/American Institute at New York University. But the photo, purportedly showing railroad workers, contained no Chinese workers -- despite there being an estimated 15,000 Chinese laborers contributing to its construction.

The photo's apparent erasure of Chinese workers inspired Lee's future work: a lifetime of photographing Asian Americans and cementing their representation in history. In one of his most famous works, he gathered a group of Chinese Americans and descendants of Chinese railroad laborers to recreate the 1868 photograph in the same original location.

His work became more widely recognized after 1975, when he captured large-scale protests against police brutality, following the He also captured other historic moments of social and political upheaval; his photos covered antiwar protests, fair housing issues,thegentrification of Chinatown, Islamophobia after 9/11, and more. His work became more widely recognized after 1975, when he captured large-scale protests against police brutality, following the beating of a Chinese American at the hands of New York police officers.

In another well-known instance, Lee photographed furious demonstrations in 1983, sparked by the murder of Vincent Chin and the light sentence for his killers -- a turning point for Asian American civil rights in the following decades.

His dedication to documenting racial injustice, its consequences and the community's resistance continued until the end, with recent work focusing on attacks toward Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the family's statement.

But his work also depicted the everyday, with many scenes from New York City's Chinatown from the late 20th century. His photos showed shopkeepers lounging next to their goods, restaurant chefs on the street during their lunch break and children performing traditional lion dance at festivals. Other shots that captured the nuance and spirit of Asian American life.

Lee was actively involved in the community in other ways, too -- in 2015 he co-founded 21 Pell Street , an organization that holds free cultural and community events in Chinatown.

A film about his life and work, ""Photographic Justice: The Corky Lee Story,"" was in production at the time of his death.

""When I think about my past, what stands out most is how hard and how long the journey has been,"" Lee says in the film's trailer . ""In all my photographs, I'm trying to include as vignettes, pages that should be in American history books, that have been omitted or taken out.""

""The pursuit of photographic justice, you have to keep going on because there's so much that needs to be done,"" he adds.

Lee was ""one of the main documentarians of the Asian American movement,"" curator Ryan Lee Wong is quoted as saying in the trailer. ""This is important because social movements are so hard to capture -- and Corky was really there at just about every rally and movement and event.""

Lee's death was met with an outpouring of grief and gratitude from the Asian American community on Wednesday.

Jennifer Takaki, the director of ""Photographic Justice,"" posted on Facebook that Lee was a ""true hero.""

""Our film will pay tribute to his legacy and his never ending pursuit of photographic justice. RIP Corky, you are loved and will be forever missed,"" she wrote.

Wong, the curator who appeared in the documentary, said in an Instagram post that he was ""devastated"" by the news.

""I don't know who we'd be without Corky Lee's photos,"" he wrote. ""When I was gathering art and archives of Asian American organizing, his photos were evidence of the struggle, a vital report from the movement. Community is made of people who show up, and he showed up to everything: rallies, exhibitions, dances, policy meetings, and every banquet in Chinatown.""

A number of institutions, including the Chinese American Museum of Chicago, the Chinese American Museum Washington DC, and the Asian Community Development Council released statements commemorating Lee's legacy.

""Photos have been crucial in preserving history. Immigrants, including AAPIs (Asian American Pacific Islanders), have greatly contributed to the rich fabric of American society,"" said Linda Ng, National President of the Organization of Chinese Americans.

""In our fight for AAPI representation at all tables, we must make sure that also includes AAPI representation in history. Corky Lee was an incredible pioneer of these efforts.""

"The son of polio vaccine creator Jonas Salk got the Covid-19 vaccine. He wants you to do it, too","(CNN) As Dr. Darrell Salk waited in line to receive his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine , he realized he had been in a similar situation about 60 years ago.

The 73-year-old retired doctor and geneticist living in Seattle remembered waiting in line at school with his classmates for a different vaccine -- it was the polio vaccine , which his father, Dr. Jonas Salk , developed.

The younger Salk said he rarely capitalizes on his name -- but he felt this time it would make a positive difference, because now he was getting the Covid-19 vaccine.

""I publicly stepped forward so I could be vaccinated publicly and have a chance to say something because I hoped that it would make a difference,"" Salk told CNN. ""I hoped that if I stepped forward from back in the shadows where I usually stay, it might help some people make up their minds. If so, I will be very grateful.""

More than 24.6 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the US, according to data published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The state of Washington has administered 534,445 doses of the vaccine, as reported by the CDC.

Children in San Ysidro, California, get their Salk vaccine shots during San Diego's 1955 mass inoculation.

Salk, who has felt fine since getting the vaccine, said he was ""delighted"" to get his first dose. Part of that is because he has several underlying conditions and is a high-risk patient, he said.

The other part is that he sees it as a feat of modern science. Salk has spent years as a vaccinologist studying the creation of vaccines, as well as how to manufacture and transport them.

""There's several aspects of it that were very impressive,"" Salk said. ""The creation of a vaccine that's effective and safe in less than a year is astounding. It's an amazing thing. To develop the polio virus vaccine took seven years.""

For him, the decision to get a vaccine was obvious, both for his health and those around him.

""The chances that you will be infected with Covid-19 is so much higher than the risk associated with the vaccine,"" he said. ""That looks like an easy choice to me. I don't want to risk my life, or the life of someone I love.""

Salk has a message for them.

""The takeaway is that these vaccines are safe, they're effective and they will help us bring this pandemic under control,"" he said. ""You should embrace the opportunity to be vaccinated and to be part of the solution.""

Polio and Covid-19 both gripped the US

The polio epidemic gripped headlines in the US as mostly children became stricken with the crippling disease. It captured the nation's attention and the emotion of it all is something people who lived through it in the first half of the 20th century remember vividly.

The Covid-19 pandemic has some of that same emotion, Salk said, but the trajectory of both diseases is markedly different.

""Polio arose gradually. It was a chronic disease or an endemic disease, and then became epidemic as the susceptible population grew,"" Salk said. ""The Covid-19 virus, on the other hand, appeared, everybody was susceptible and had no experience with it before. It spread basically like wildfire ... around the world very rapidly.""

Beyond the zero-to-60 mph speed of the spread of Covid-19, the fatality rate of the virus is much higher than polio, Salk said.

Dr. Jonas Salk gives his son, Darrell, the polio vaccine as his mother looks on in the 1950s.

Seeing Covid-19 vaccines distributed has made Salk think of his father and how ""pleased and excited he would have been to see this,"" he said.

""It impressed on me the importance of the work that my father did, both stopping the epidemic with the vaccine itself, and demonstrating that you could use noninfectious agents to immunize,"" Salk said. His father used a killed polio virus to create the vaccine.

Living through the Covid-19 pandemic has had a duality to it for Salk, who is both intrigued and frightened of it.

""I had this kind of push me, pull you reaction,"" he said. ""I was scared by it, but then I was fascinated to be able to be part of it, to see it and to live through it.""

US response to the pandemic 'embarrasses' him

Simple acts like washing your hands, wearing a mask and avoiding crowds could have controlled the spread of Covid-19. How the US responded to the pandemic frankly embarrasses Salk, he said.

""It's really a shame that in this country, supposedly the epitome of advanced countries, the response was, I'm sorry, bungled so badly,"" he said.

""We're now swimming upstream,"" he said. ""It embarrasses me that the United States is number one in problems with the Covid-19 virus, more cases than anyplace else, it's spreading faster than anyplace else. It's embarrassing to me that this country did not respond properly because it was not driven by the science.""

The way to get the virus under control lies in enough people getting the vaccine and Salk hopes that Americans opt to get it.

""Vaccines are safe and effective, and they should be widely used,"" he said. ""We will get out of this, but it will take individuals doing the proper behavior in order to get rid of it."""
"After '7 minutes of terror,' NASA's Perseverance rover will begin an 'epic journey' on Mars next month","(CNN) In 22 days, NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover will land on Mars in Jezero Crater to search for signs of ancient life that may have been on the red planet in the past.

The rover, which is the largest and most advanced rover NASA has ever built, will act as a robotic geologist, collecting samples of dirt and rocks that will eventually be returned to Earth by the 2030s.

For that reason, Perseverance is also the cleanest machine ever sent to Mars, designed so it doesn't contaminate the Martian samples with any microbes from Earth, providing a false reading.

Live coverage from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory will be available on the agency's website on February 18, the day of the landing, beginning at 2:15 p.m. ET.

The mission teams have made many modifications due to the pandemic, but they have adapted to work safely and effectively. The team that will be at JPL during the landing conducted an adapted simulation of the landing that transpired last week over three days.

""Don't let anybody tell you different -- landing on Mars is hard to do,"" said John McNamee, project manager for the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission at JPL, in a statement. ""But the women and men on this team are the best in the world at what they do. When our spacecraft hits the top of the Mars atmosphere at about three-and-a-half miles per second, we'll be ready.""

Perseverance is the latest step in NASA's long history of exploring the red planet. It builds on lessons learned from previous missions with new goals that will shed more light on the history of Mars.

""NASA has been exploring Mars since Mariner 4 performed a flyby in July of 1965, with two more flybys, seven successful orbiters, and eight landers since then,"" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, in a statement.

""Perseverance, which was built from the collective knowledge gleaned from such trailblazers, has the opportunity to not only expand our knowledge of the Red Planet, but to investigate one of the most important and exciting questions of humanity about the origin of life both on Earth and also on other planets.""

The spacecraft, launched in July , only has about 25.6 million miles left of its 292.5 million-mile adventure from Earth to Mars. And once it arrives at Mars, the rover's journey to the planet's surface starts with a bang.

The teams at NASA call it the ""seven minutes of terror.""

And just weeks after the landing, video cameras and microphones on the spacecraft will show the rover's perspective of this harrowing experience.

'Seven minutes of terror'

The one-way light time it takes for radio signals to travel from Earth to Mars is about 10.5 minutes, which means the seven minutes it takes for the spacecraft to land on Mars will occur without any help or intervention from NASA teams on Earth.

This is the ""seven minutes of terror."" The ground teams tell the spacecraft when to begin EDL (entry, descent and landing) and the spacecraft takes over from there.

It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most critical and dangerous part of the mission, according to Allen Chen, Mars 2020 entry, descent, and landing lead at JPL.

""It is not guaranteed that we will be successful,"" Zurbuchen acknowledged. The mission teams, however, have done everything they can to prepare for a successful landing.

This rover is the heaviest that NASA has ever attempted to land, weighing in at over a metric ton.

The spacecraft hits the top of the Martian atmosphere moving at 12,000 miles per hour and has to slow down to zero miles per hour seven minutes later when the rover softly lands on the surface.

It will streak across the Martian sky like a meteor, Chen said.

This illustration shows the events that occur in the final minutes of NASA's Perseverance rover for it to land on the Martian surface.

About 10 minutes before entering the thin Martian atmosphere, the cruise stage that has carried the spacecraft on its journey through space is shed and the rover prepares for a guided entry, where small thrusters on the aeroshell help adjust its angle.

The spacecraft's heat shield will endure peak heating of 2,370 degrees Fahrenheit, 75 seconds after entering the atmosphere.

Perseverance is targeting a 28-mile-wide ancient lake bed and river delta, the most challenging site yet for a NASA spacecraft landing on Mars. Rather than being flat and smooth, the small landing site is littered with sand dunes, steep cliffs, boulders and small craters.

The spacecraft has two upgrades -- called Range Trigger and Terrain-Relative Navigation -- to navigate this difficult and hazardous site.

Range Trigger will tell the 70.5-foot-wide parachute when to deploy based on the spacecraft's position 240 seconds after entering the atmosphere. After the parachute deploys, the heat shield will detach.

The rover's Terrain-Relative Navigation acts like a second brain, using cameras to take pictures of the ground as it rapidly approaches and determines the safest spot to land. It can shift the landing spot by up to 2,000 feet, according to NASA.

The back shell and parachute separate after the heat shield is discarded when the spacecraft is 1.3 miles above the Martian surface. The Mars landing engines, which include eight retrorockets, will fire to slow the descent from 190 miles per hour to about 1.7 miles per hour.

Then, the famed sky crane maneuver that landed the Curiosity rover will occur. Nylon cords will lower the rover 25 feet below the descent stage. After the rover touches down on the Martian surface, the cords will detach and the descent stage will fly away and land at a safe distance.

On the surface of Mars

Once the rover has landed, Perseverance's two-year mission will begin, and it will go through a ""checkout"" period to make sure it's ready.

The rover will also find a nice, flat surface to drop the Ingenuity helicopter so it has a place to use as a helipad for its potential five test flights during a 30-day period. This will occur within the first 50 to 90 sols, or Martian days, of the mission.

Once Ingenuity is settled on the surface, Perseverance will drive to a safe spot at a distance and use its cameras to watch Ingenuity's flight.

This will be the first flight of a helicopter on another planet.

After those flights, Perseverance will begin searching for evidence of ancient life, study Mars' climate and geology and collect samples that will eventually be returned to Earth via planned future missions. It will drive three times faster than previous rovers.

Jezero Crater was chosen as Perseverance's home because billions of years ago, the basin was the site of a lake and river delta. Rocks and dirt from this basin could provide fossilized evidence of past microbial life, as well as more information about what ancient Mars was like.

""Perseverance's sophisticated science instruments will not only help in the hunt for fossilized microbial life, but also expand our knowledge of Martian geology and its past, present, and future,"" said Ken Farley, project scientist for Mars 2020, in a statement.

""Our science team has been busy planning how best to work with what we anticipate will be a firehose of cutting-edge data. That's the kind of 'problem' we are looking forward to.""

This mosaic of images collected by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows a possible route the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover could take across Jezero Crater.

The path Perseverance will traverse is about 15 miles long, an ""epic journey"" that will take years, Farley said. What scientists could discover about Mars, though, is worth the journey.

Perseverance also carries instruments that could help further exploration on Mars in the future, like MOXIE, the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment. This experiment, about the size of a car battery, will attempt to convert Martian carbon dioxide into oxygen.

Not only could this help NASA scientists learn how to produce rocket fuel on Mars, but also oxygen that could be use during future human exploration of the red planet.

""The mission provides hope and unity,"" Zurbuchen said. ""As our cosmic neighbor, Mars continues to captivate our imagination."""
Biden administration takes cautious approach as it touts using Defense Production Act,"(CNN) The Biden administration has repeatedly touted its plans to aggressively use the Defense Production Act as it combats the coronavirus pandemic, but behind the scenes, a slower, more painstaking effort is underway.

The more cautious and contemplative effort means the new administration has yet to announce any new deals in its early days to ramp up supplies related to Covid-19 vaccine production , testing or personal protective equipment -- even as officials tout the use of the law.

""It was invoked, and it means our work is ongoing with companies to ensure that we are expediting the manufacturing of materials to ensure that we can get 100 million shots in the arms of Americans,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday, rattling off a list of supplies the administration plans to increase production of without specifying any companies that were part of the efforts.

Manufacturers like Beckton, Dickinson and Company, which makes syringes, and MilliporeSigma, which makes single-use bags used in vaccine manufacturing, have both been in conversation with the Biden administration. But spokespeople from both companies said they were already working to expand capacity and, so far, have not started any new production efforts at the direction of the Biden administration.

The new administration -- only a week in -- has taken steps to try to improve the US coronavirus response. The most notable move, perhaps, was placing new orders with Pfizer and Moderna for their vaccines, though the administration said those orders aren't likely to be delivered until the summer.

"Feds rushing to find leads on person who put bombs outside RNC and DNC buildings, and worry they'll strike again","(CNN) Three weeks after the US Capitol insurrection, authorities in Washington, DC, have gathered only limited information about the person who placed two devices that were rigged to explode outside of the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic parties on the day of the siege -- and are asking the public for help, afraid that the bomber could strike again.

Remains of the pipe bombs, which were safely detonated by a robot at each scene, are being scrutinized at the FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia, and officials have broadcast grainy images of the person suspected of planting them alongside a $75,000 reward for information.

But as tips have poured in and charges have mounted against rioters who stormed the legislative building on January 6, the identity of the would-be bomber remains a mystery and one of the most troubling avenues of the massive federal investigation.

""They could potentially be building more bombs right now,"" said Ashan Benedict, the special agent in charge of the Washington Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, in an interview Wednesday.

At approximately 1:00 p.m. EST on January 6, 2021, multiple law enforcement agencies received reports of a suspected pipe bomb with wires at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee. At approximately 1:15 p.m. EST, a second suspected pipe bomb with similar descriptors was reported at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.

""This person obviously knows who he or she is, they may have told their story to someone else, and in the face of humanity, the fact that a lot of people could have been hurt if this device went off should be enough for someone to come forward so it doesn't happen again,"" he said.

"Only half of Covid-19 vaccines delivered to states have been used, CDC data shows. Here's one reason why","(CNN) A possible explanation is emerging for why federal data shows only about half of the vaccine supply delivered in the US has been administered.

The nation's vaccine distribution figures have baffled observers for weeks, with states claiming they need more vaccine when the data indicates they still have many doses on hand.

Health officials for President Joe Biden sought to explain on Wednesday, at least in part.

Speaking at a media briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said not all vaccine that's been delivered to states is available for ""inserting into people's arms.""

White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients took that explanation a step further.

""Some of what the states have right now is inventory to do the very, very important second shot,"" Zients said. ""I think it's important that when you're looking at state's inventories that you recognize that some of that inventory is being held for the very important second shot.""

Walensky, when asked by CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Wednesday if it is the right approach for states to hold onto Covid-19 vaccine that is intended for second doses, declined to directly answer the question.

An administration official on Wednesday told CNN states should not be holding back second doses and that is not the Biden administration's guidance.

The Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines currently available for emergency use in the US require two doses. A federal dashboard tracks the nation's distribution of these vaccines. The data shows how many doses of vaccine have been delivered to each state, but it does not differentiate between first and second doses.

Consider Florida, where the federal data on Wednesday showed about 3.1 million doses had been delivered and about 1.6 million had been administered. That's roughly 50% of the doses going into arms.

On Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki used similar figures to suggest that Florida had a good deal of vaccine, after Florida governor Ron DeSantis claimed the state wasn't getting enough supply from the federal government and needed more.

""I will note, because we're data-first here, facts-first, they've only distributed about 50% of the vaccines they've been given in Florida,"" Psaki said. ""So, clearly they have a good deal of the vaccine.""

On Wednesday, DeSantis pushed back against those comments from the White House, explaining the federal data didn't account for vaccine earmarked for second doses.

""When the person at the White House says that Florida has all these doses, those are second doses,"" DeSantis said.

Other states also say part of their vaccine inventory is intended for second shots.

""When a first dose comes, you can just go ahead and give it to someone. When a second doses comes, it needs to be 21 days later for Pfizer or 28 days later for Moderna,"" Kristen Ehresmann, the director of Minnesota's Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Prevention and Control Division, said in an email to CNN. ""So yes, we get this vaccine and then give it at the appropriate interval and it can look like we are 'sitting on doses' when that is not the case.""

In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo has started to express the state's vaccine distribution figures in terms of first and second doses, announcing Wednesday that 96% of the state's allocated first doses have been administered, excluding the federal long-term care facility vaccination program with CVS and Walgreens.

On Tuesday, Cuomo said his state was ""basically out of vaccine,"" but that same day New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had also complained about being short on vaccine, said the city did have doses intended for second shots in its inventory.

""I've got a hundred thousand second doses,"" de Blasio told MSNBC.

De Blasio went on to say the doses were ""sitting on a shelf"" and ""can't be used for weeks."" He said President Biden should order governments across the country to take second doses in their inventory and use them right now for first doses.

""Even a first dose gives folks about 50% protection,"" he said.

Cuomo said on Tuesday second doses aren't being distributed as first doses due to uncertainty over how quickly additional doses of vaccine can be made.

""The fear is, until you really know what the production schedule is, if you start using the second dose as the first dose, you have to have a dramatically increased supply otherwise you're going to leave people without a second dose when their appointment is due,"" said Cuomo.

It's unclear how many states have an inventory of second doses, or how many states may be handling distribution of second doses differently. The White House and the Health and Human Services Department did not immediately respond to CNN's inquiries for additional details.

In Maryland, the state is not holding onto any reserve doses in its warehouses aside from doses to be administered that week, according to Charles Gischlar of the state's department of health. Gischalar says Maryland has requested the federal government automatically distribute second doses to providers who were provided with first doses."

Millions of Americans are at increased risk for more severe Covid-19 because of tobacco use, according to a new report from The American Lung Association.

“Tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease in America, killing 480,000 people each year,” said the American Lung Association in their State of Tobacco Control 2021 report.

The annual report, published Wednesday, added, “In addition, 16 million Americans live with a tobacco related disease.”

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that smoking can cause more severe symptoms of Covid-19.

“With the threat of Covid-19 in addition to the numerous tobacco-caused diseases, it is imperative to prevent youth from starting to use tobacco and to help everyone quit,” said the report.

The association makes the point that, similarly to the coronavirus, smoking also has disproportionate impacts on certain communities, particularly those of color.

Some 50.6 million Americans are currently using tobacco products, the report says, with use of commercial products particularly high among Native Americans and Alaskan Natives -- 29.3% -- and Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual adults -- 29.9%.

Adults with mental illness and substance abuse also have higher rates of smoking, the report says."
"Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano erupts, spews clouds of ash","Jakarta, Indonesia Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano on Java island erupted on Wednesday, sending up a cloud of ash and prompting authorities to warn of the risk of lava flows reaching roads, officials said.

The 2,963 meter (9,721 feet) high Merapi is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and is already on the country's second highest alert level.

Kasbani, the head of Indonesia's volcanology and geological hazard mitigation center, said Merapi had spewed ""quite intense"" hot clouds at least 30 times since Wednesday morning and warned of a danger of lava cutting roads near the volcano.

Photographs shared on social media showed ash covering the homes of some nearby residents.

There were no immediate reports of damage, but some residents had chosen to leave their homes, said the local disaster mitigation agency.

"Pediatrician fatally shoots another doctor and himself during hostage situation in Austin, Texas, police say","(CNN) A pediatrician diagnosed with terminal cancer killed another pediatrician during a hostage situation before turning the gun on himself, according to an Austin Police Department news release.

Dispatchers received a call on Tuesday saying a man walked into the offices of Children's Medical Group with a gun and was holding hostages inside the building.

Initially, several hostages were being held, police said, but some escaped and others were allowed to leave, except Dr. Katherine Dodson, a pediatrician at CMG. Hostages told officers the man was armed with a pistol and what appeared to be a shotgun, police said. He also had two duffel bags.

The armed man was identified as Dr. Bharat Narumanchi, 43, a pediatrician who was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer, police said. Records show he had resided in multiple states and that his last state of residence was California.

He had visited the CMG office a week prior to the shooting and applied for a volunteer position, police said. Other than his recent visit, police were unable to find a connection between Dodson and Narumanchi.

Companies hope people will buy the idea of antibody treatments to prevent Covid,"(CNN) Makers of monoclonal antibody treatments say they have shown the therapies can help prevent severe coronavirus disease in people who are already infected. Now they're planning to ask the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization to use them as a kind of ""passive vaccine"" to protect people at high risk of infection.

The treatments made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly and Co. are only authorized for use with non-hospitalized patients at high risk of severe disease. If they get the FDA's OK, it's still an open question as to how many people will use them.

The United States has been slow to roll out Covid-19 vaccines, and for different reasons , it's been even slower to adopt monoclonal antibodies. The companies are gambling that maybe Americans will be quicker to embrace these lab-engineered immune system proteins as prevention.

Monoclonal treatment 101

However, the treatments are not as simple as swallowing a pill. A nurse wearing full protective gear needs to administer the treatment for about an hour and then monitor the patient for another.

Monoclonal treatments have a lot of advantages. They work right away, unlike a vaccine that takes a few weeks to kick in.

Plus, they'll cost the patients nothing under an agreement the companies reached with the government, although there may be an administration fee.

Both companies released additional details about the results of prevention trials Tuesday, although they have yet to publish the results.

Antibody treatments may protect nursing homes

On a shareholder call Tuesday, Lilly discussed what it called ""a remarkable"" prevention trial that it did with nursing home patients and staff.

Lilly set up on-site infusion centers at nursing homes that had reported a recent Covid-19 case. The company infused 965 people who tested negative for the coronavirus and 132 who tested positive.

Half the volunteers got the treatment, known as LY-CoV555or bamlanivimab, while the other group got a placebo, which does nothing.

After eight weeks, trial results showed residents and staff who got the treatment had an 80% lower risk of testing positive for Covid-19 than the people in the same facility who got a placebo.

During the trial, 16 residents died, some of them from Covid-19. No staff did. Eleven of those who died were among the group that got the placebo, compared to five who had received the antibody therapy.

""Bamlanivimab can play a critical role in turning the tide of this pandemic,"" said Lilly's chief science officer Dr. Daniel Skovronsky. He said he believes it can help the country's most vulnerable demographic. Nursing homes have had high rates of infection and accounted for 40% of US Covid-related deaths, a January study found.

Antibody treatments may protect against infections in the home

Regeneron has been testing its antibody treatment as a way to protect people vulnerable to infection after someone in their own home has tested positive.

Among 400 volunteers, half got the therapy and half got a placebo. The number of infections was lower among those who got the treatment, the company said Tuesday.

Among the volunteers who got the therapy, those who did get sick had symptoms that lasted no more than one week, while 40% of people in the placebo group who got infected were sick for three to four weeks.

None of those who were infected who received the therapy had high viral loads, while 62% of those in the placebo group who were infected had high viral loads.

One person given placebo died. There were no deaths or hospitalizations in the group that got the treatment.

Where antibodies fit in a world with vaccines

Eli Lilly and Regeneron argue that their treatments can play an important role in the pandemic, even as more people get vaccinated.

""These data using REGEN-COV as a passive vaccine suggest that it may both reduce transmission of the virus as well as reduce viral and disease burden in those who still get infected,"" Dr. George Yancopoulos, president and chief scientific officer at Regeneron, said in a news release.

""Even with the emerging availability of active vaccines, we continue to see hundreds of thousands of people infected daily, actively spreading the virus to their close contacts. The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail may be able to help break this chain by providing immediate passive immunity to those at high risk of infection, in contrast to active vaccines which take weeks to provide protection,"" Yancopoulos said.

Lilly's Skovronsky said there is ""variable uptake of vaccination,"" in nursing homes. In some cases less than 50% want to be vaccinated.

""There are deaths every day in these facilities and that motivates us to be aggressive about prophylaxis, where we think we can have a quick impact during this sort of uncertain mixed vaccination period,"" Skovronsky said.

Skovronsky also thinks there may come a day when the vaccines may not fully protect against the new variants of Covid-19.

""That probably informs our thinking on next generation antibodies and the need to stay ahead of this,"" Skovronsky said.

Lilly is testing bamlanivimab against new variants of the virus. Regeneron's tests on two different variants of the coronavirus show that one of the two monoclonal antibodies in its cocktail therapy can neutralize both, despite the mutations.

If approved how do people get these treatments

that of the antibody treatments sent out, on average only 39% have actually been used. So far, the US has been slow to adopt antibody treatments. Last week the Health and Human Services Department told CNNthat of the antibody treatments sent out, on average only 39% have actually been used.

It's unclear if more people will use a treatment that can protect them from getting sick. It's also unclear if the FDA will authorize the monoclonals for this kind of use. If they get emergency use authorization, the companies said they have laid the groundwork and have already taken steps to educate people about these treatments and encourage more people to use them.

Eli Lilly said it has set up a 24 hour support line and there now are a number of websites, including Covid.infusioncenter.org , that can help people find infusion centers close by.

Some states have also tried to be more proactive. Contact tracers have been encouraged to mention them when letting someone know they've been recently exposed to Covid-19.

JUST WATCHED 'Hunger Games' approach blamed for Covid-19 vaccine woes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Hunger Games' approach blamed for Covid-19 vaccine woes 04:03

Some hospitals have also tried to be proactive, using electronic records to quickly get in touch and offer treatments as soon as they get a positive result. If the FDA allows these treatments to be used preventively, the systems could always adjust to contact a person as soon as they have been tested, without regard to the result.

Regeneron said if its treatment is authorized for prevention, a doctor could always prescribe it for the person being treating and for their household.

Eli Lilly said if people really want these treatments, they may have to ask for them directly.

""I think patients and providers, in some cases, have to be persistent to navigate our health care system as is, unfortunately, often the case with different diseases, to get optimal therapy,"" Skovronsky said. ""But for patients who want it and qualify and providers who think it's right for their patients, it's widely available."""
Teacher unions flex their power in Covid school reopening chaos,"Fourteen members of her extended family tested positive after they grieved together for the loss of her grandmother last November.

So Torres feels safer at home -- and that's where she plans to keep herself and her three children.

As a Spanish teacher at James Monroe Elementary School in Chicago, she has hundreds of other children also relying on her. But in the pandemic, she's made her choice to put family first.

""I need to worry about not just what my students are facing, but also what my family and myself are facing,"" she told CNN. ""I think it's OK that, at a time like this, that I take a step back and consider me at this point.""

Torres has a powerful ally in her corner: the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU). And the union has a powerful weapon at its disposal: The ability to strike.

Lori Torres, a Spanish teacher at James Monroe Elementary School, says it's too soon for teachers and students to return to the classroom in person.

Chicago Public Schools (CPS) CEO Dr. Janice Jackson said the district has plans to mitigate the spread of any coronavirus outbreaks in schools. She and other school officials believe it's time to get everyone back to the classroom.

More than 70,000 K-8th grade students -- about 37% of eligible students -- have indicated to the school district they intend to return on February 1.

The CTU has told its members to be prepared to go on strike if the school district retaliates for teachers choosing to continue teaching online -- yet neither the retaliation nor strike have happened.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a recent news conference that she's ""deeply disappointed"" that 10 months into the pandemic, with plans made and work done, there is still no agreement between CPS and CTU -- especially as city officials have pointed to the educational divide as more than just a Covid mitigation issue.

Jackson said the vast majority of students whose grades are falling and being impacted dramatically by Covid-19 are Black and Latino students.

""If people don't see that as an equity issue, I really don't know what else to say,"" Jackson said.

Torres remains frustrated at the school district's insistence that teachers return.

""My first reaction was simply 'how inhumane,'"" she said. ""I'm comfortable being at home. It's safer at home. It may not be true for everyone. And we understand that, but the reality is it's too soon. If it comes to it, I am prepared to strike.""

Some parents torn on whether to send kids back to school

Many parents know that much of the load usually alleviated by in-person school is also falling on them.

Steven Keys, a father of a 2nd grader and 7th grader, put it simply: ""Every day, it's like a different test.""

His wife Reella Garcia listed off the multiple roles she now has to fulfill for her children in virtual learning -- teacher, mom, lunch cook and more.

Still, the couple has concerns about sending their children back to school.

""We're not fully comfortable with it -- hearing that it's possibly a new strand of Covid that's supposedly could hit us,"" Garcia said. ""And just knowing that my kids would have to sit there all this time with a mask on.""

The Keys family: Jezeniah Keys (7th grade), Steven Keys, Reella Garcia, Mariah Keys (2nd grade) pictured left to right.

As a two-parent household, they know they have options.

""We want to make sure that we're not just, you know, expediting our children and putting them in a situation where we just want them out the house,"" Keys said.

""We do get it, that this social aspect is vitally important. I don't believe you can substitute the virtual experience for the in-person, but we know why we're in the predicament we are in, because of Covid-19.""

That's one of the Chicago Teachers Union's arguments: if many parents are choosing not to send their children back, why should teachers be forced into classrooms?

""Parents have overwhelmingly rejected in-person learning under the current conditions,"" CTU President Jesse Sharkey said in a Tuesday statement.

""There are many options that we've proposed to staff classrooms where children are returning without putting every single member of the school community at increased risk — including thousands of educators with families at heightened risk from COVID.""

CDC: In-person learning possible with the right precautions

Torres said she believes there should be vaccinations for teachers, and guarantees that school ventilation systems are good enough, especially on older campuses.

Her union has a similar demand.

""The Union is seeking a health metric based on CDC guidance, a phased reopening, access to vaccinations for educators, and enforceable safety standards in school buildings, which have struggled to meet even basic needs for PPE, adequate ventilation and clean facilities,"" the CTU said in a statement on Tuesday.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that teachers get vaccinations -- along with firefighters, grocery store clerks and other essential workers -- ahead of the general population.

Teachers have been early in line to get shots in places like California, but for some teachers' unions that is still not enough.

There are arguments going on in Fairfax County, Virginia, where CNN affiliate WJLA reports teachers are getting their vaccinations but now calling for full in-person learning to be delayed until students get their vaccinations. The current vaccines have not been tested on children.

In states like Georgia, teachers are not backed by unions and some districts have required them to be back for in-person learning. Deaths of teachers from coronavirus, such as two educators who died within hours of each other in Cobb County, are adding to anxiety. Teachers there want the opportunity of virtual learning, with one leader telling CNN they felt lives were being put at risk, but strikes are not an option.

The experts noted that the kind of spread seen in crowded offices and long-term care facilities has not been reported in schools. And while in-school transmission has occurred, they said there is little evidence that it contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.

In Chicago, the CTU said that as of Tuesday, ""a majority of Chicago's public schools fall outside of the newly released Center for Disease Control guidelines.""

""Currently, Chicago's schools lack access to adequate testing and tracing programs, proper PPE, necessary room ventilation and sanitization, and priority vaccination of educators and school support staff.""

Still, Rosario Anacleto, a parent in Chicago, said her family is ready for schools to open.

""I'm that parent that's constantly like 'Put your mask over your nose. Do not touch this, do not touch that,'"" she told CNN. ""I believe I've implemented that into their brains enough and, with the school's help in watching and everything that is pretty much now our new normal, that they're going to do OK.""

Her son, third-grader Jose Santiago, would agree.

""I just really want to see my friends,"" Santiago said. ""When we're on the computer I go to talk to them and I get headaches sometimes and my eyes start to hurt."""
Virginia gubernatorial candidate who called US Capitol rioters 'patriots' censured by state Senate,"Washington (CNN) The Virginia Senate voted Wednesday to censure state Sen. Amanda Chase, a Republican who is a candidate for governor, following her comments earlier this month referring to the rioters who stormed the US Capitol as ""patriots.""

Chase had addressed the January 6 rally in Washington prior to the insurrection but did not march on the Capitol. She had said she was driving home when the storming of the building took place.

In a floor speech after the episode, according to The Washington Post, Chase defended then-President Donald Trump's role in inciting the riot and said the violent mob wasn't a group of ""rioters and looters.""

""These were patriots who loved their country and do not want to see our great republic turned into a socialist country,"" she said. ""I was there with the people. I know.""

Wednesday's censure vote is the latest in a string of controversies involving Chase . She drew scrutiny when she openly carried a firearm on her hip during Senate sessions and when she got into a verbal altercation with a Virginia Capitol police officer over a parking spot.

A statement from Republican members of the state Senate said they ""were guided by their consciences"" on the censure vote but were ""united in their disappointment in Senator Chase and their disdain for her actions.""

""Senator Chase's selfishness and constant need for media attention, with which the Senate Republican Caucus is keenly familiar, brought us to the situation in which the Senate found itself today,"" the statement said.

""While we remain hopeful today's action discourages the frequent disruptions and distractions fomented by Senator Chase, the experience of our caucus suggests otherwise. We sincerely hope this is the exceptional circumstance where Senator Chase exceeds our expectations.""

Chase, meanwhile, said in a tweet Wednesday morning that the censure ""is nothing more than a politically driven attack.""

""The establishment elite is desperate to take me out of the running, but they will not succeed! This is nothing more than a failed attempt to tarnish my good name, reputation, and solid conservative record,"" she said in an email to constituents later.

At least 150 people have been charged by federal prosecutors in connection with the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, according to a CNN review of court records and Justice Department announcements, and a top prosecutor said charges of sedition are not out of the question.

Many of the defendants CNN has identified have been charged with entering a restricted building without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct in the Capitol. The more serious charges have ranged from theft of government property, conspiracy and interstate threats to assault on law enforcement."
"Offensive lineman Chad Wheeler faces charge of felony domestic violence, waived by Seattle Seahawks","(CNN) Now-former Seahawks player Chad Wheeler was arrested Friday on suspicion of felony domestic violence after an incident at a residence in a Seattle suburb, police and court records say.

The incident began at around 9:44 p.m. PT in Kent, Washington, according to Kent Police Department Assistant Chief Jarod Kasner.

According to court documents, prosecutors said, ""(Wheeler) viciously attacked the victim in her bedroom, strangling her at times with both hands."" Wheeler is also accused of strangling the victim twice until she lost consciousness.

The victim texted friends, her family and Wheeler's father to call 911, according to the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office and police officers who arrived forced entry after hearing her screaming inside. An officer attempted to use a Taser to subdue Wheeler ""with little effect.""

Wheeler faces charges of first-degree domestic violence assault, domestic violence unlawful imprisonment and resisting arrest. He will enter a plea at his arraignment, scheduled for February 9.

Facebook plans to reduce political content in the News Feed,"(CNN Business) Facebook's business continues to fire on all cylinders even as the company faces growing scrutiny from regulators over its acquisitions and from critics for the role its platform may have played in spreading lies about the US presidential election.

Facebook FB The company said Wednesday that it posted a profit of $11.2 billion in the final three months of last year, an increase of more than 50% from the year prior.'s revenue rose 33% to roughly $28 billion during the quarter, showing the durability of its core advertising business despite the pandemic.

On a conference call with analysts, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook is considering steps it can take to reduce the amount of political content in the News Feed. ""One of the top pieces of feedback that we're hearing from our community right now is that people don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services,"" Zuckerberg said.

Ahead of the US presidential election, Facebook stopped recommending civic and political groups to its users. Now, it plans to keep them out of recommendations for the long term globally, Zuckerberg said.

When combining Facebook's various apps, including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, the company reported 3.3 billion monthly active users, an increase of 14% year-over-year.

First lady Jill Biden expected to take active role in immigrant family reunification,"(CNN) The Biden administration's planned task force aimed at reuniting children who were separated from their parents at the border under the Trump-era enforcement policies will include input from first lady Jill Biden, according to three sources familiar with the planning.

Biden is tasking her East Wing with taking an active role in the reunification project. Her interest in the task force could offer something of a stark contrast with former first lady Melania Trump

Trump made her first trip to visit a border facility for children and families in Texas in June 2018 in the midst of the zero-tolerance separation controversy, but did so wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words, ""I really don't care. Do U?"" The jacket spawned a news cycle of its own, drawing attention away from Trump's objective for the visit, and helping create a public perception of a first lady disinterested in the issue. In an interview several months after her border trip, Trump called the separation of families, ""unacceptable"" and ""heartbreaking.""

The current first lady's upcoming involvement in the issue and its targeted task force will lend visibility to the mission of reuniting children with their parents, which remains a crisis for many families. Lawyers are still unable to reach the parents of 611 children who had been split from their families by US border officials between 2017 and 2018, according to the latest court filing. The Justice Department also officially rescinded the policy Tuesday in a memo to federal prosecutors, even though it had already been ended.

""As the first lady remarked on a 'Charla' with young Latinos earlier this week, her chief of staff, Ambassador Julissa Reynoso, will monitor the federal reunification effort given her background as a lawyer,"" Biden spokesman Michael LaRosa told CNN on Wednesday, confirming the East Wing's anticipated involvement. Reynoso has firsthand perspective, having moved to the United States with her family from a rural village in the Dominican Republic when she was a child.

Tesla disappoints Wall Street despite strong profits,"New York (CNN Business) Tesla capped its breakout year with a record profit that still fell short of analysts forecasts, sending its shares lower in after-hours trading.

The electric car maker reported fourth quarter adjusted income of $903 million, excluding special items, more than double its earnings a year ago but short of the $1.1 billion forecast by analysts. Net income was $270 million, well short of the $780 million estimated by Wall Street.

The company posted quarterly revenue of $10.7 billion, which was up 46% from a year earlier, and which — unlike the profit numbers — topped Wall Street forecasts.

Still the results capped a year of strong growth for the company despite the problems associated with Covid-19 temporarily shutting factories and sparking a global recession that slowed auto sales overall.

Revenue was up 31% for the year, and adjusted income was up more than 6,700% from the modest profit Tesla posted on that basis in 2019, the automaker's first profitable year . Net income for 2020 was $721 million, compared with a net loss of $862 million a year earlier."
Appalachian Trail Conservancy recommends that hikers delay long expeditions to 2022 due to Covid-19,"(CNN) For those who have hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT) on their bucket list for the year, Covid-19 may prove to be an unexpected complication.

The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), the organization responsible for managing and protecting the famous trail, is advising all long-distance hikers wanting to try their hand at completing the full trail or multi-day hikes to wait until 2022.

""We're really basing our guidance on the best information we have,"" President and CEO Sandra Marra told CNN. ""The guidance is based on science, on the states and the federal outline as to how we can proceed until everyone is fully vaccinated.""

Marra said that the ATC is looking at guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and a pandemic task force that they have been working with for over a year.

Long-distance hikers are more likely to pose a risk

Since the Appalachian Trail is internationally known, Marra said, one of the main issues is that it's virtually impossible, if you don't live in the area, to keep from contributing to the spread of Covid-19.

""If you're planning a long-distance hike you're going to have to travel somehow to get to the trailhead,"" Marra said. ""Once you start hiking, again with long-distance hiking in particular, you're going to be more exposed to people because you are traveling further, and all of our sections of trail right now are very busy because we are still encouraging people to go out on day hikes locally.""

She said that most of the towns that include trailheads are more vulnerable because of their rural locations and if hikers go into the town to get supplies, that in itself can put a hiker or the community at risk.

On top of all of that, most of the overnight shelters on the 2,200-mile trail remain closed and hikers may have to carry extra equipment to accommodate any overnight stays on the trail, which some may not realize can add extra difficulty. If the difficulty turns into an injury or distress, local first responders can be put at risk.

There are measures for those who want to continue

Marra said the organization knows it can't stop anyone from doing a long-distance hike, so there are several measures in place for those wanting to hit the trail in 2021, which currently includes more than 2,600 registered guests.

-- The ATC encourages everyone to register so that if health changes occur, such as another shutdown in a particular state or section, they know who to contact;

-- Hikers need to carry a mask and hand sanitizer so that they can keep themselves and others safe;

-- Since most shelters are closed, hikers need to plan to tent alone or bring a hammock for overnight stays;

-- Hikers need to be experienced and know how to handle themselves on the trail

But, again, the ATC strongly recommends against it.

""We all have to work together and we have to make sacrifices until this vaccine rolls out,"" Marra said. ""This is just a postponement of something you want to do -- we all have a responsibility to make sacrifices for the greater good.""

Marra said that the organization is going to continue to monitor the CDC guidelines and the Covid-19 situation in order to keep hikers safe and informed."
Biden administration pauses arms sales to Saudi Arabia and UAE,"Washington (CNN) The Biden administration has paused arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as it conducts a wider review of agreements worth billions of dollars made by the Trump administration, sources familiar with the matter told CNN Wednesday.

Secretary of State Tony Blinken confirmed that pending arms sales are under review, as is typical at the start of a new administration, ""to make sure that what is being considered is something that advances our strategic objectives, and advances our foreign policy.""

He did not reference any specific sales or countries in his remarks, which were made at his first State Department news conference as top US diplomat.

The move to freeze the pending sales to the Gulf allies could signal a change in approach by the Biden administration after the Trump administration approved major sales in the last months of its tenure.

Gulf nations that have sales in the pipeline had expected some sort of pause for the administration to review but the practical impact isn't clear yet, a source familiar with Gulf nations' thinking said.

A State Department official earlier described the pause as ""a routine administrative action typical to most any transition, and demonstrates the administration's commitment to transparency and good governance, as well as ensuring US arms sales meet our strategic objectives of building stronger, interoperable, and more capable security partners.""

The official also did not highlight specific countries in their comment.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the pause.

Democrats in Congress immediately came out in favor of the move.

""The weapons we sold to Saudi Arabia and UAE have been used to kill schoolchildren, transferred to extremist militias, and fueled a dangerous arms race in the Middle East,"" tweeted Sen. Chris Murphy. ""This is the right move. The time is now to reset our relationships with Gulf allies.""

Incoming Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said he welcomed the pause in the sales, which he said ""were inexplicably rushed without thorough review of implications for U.S. national security and protection of innocent lives in Yemen.""

""I encourage the Biden Administration to carefully consider the broader regional security implications of these sales and to consult with Congress as it continues its due diligence on these and other arms sales,"" he said on Twitter.

On Tuesday, a group of Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to Blinken calling for scrutiny and overhaul of the US-Saudi relationship, and among other requests, urged him to freeze the delivery of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia.

At the end of last year, the Trump administration pushed through a number of high-dollar arms sales to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi tied to the Abraham Accords, which were agreements to normalize relations with Israel.

The former administration also issued an emergency declaration in 2019 in order to expedite arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE in circumvention of congressional concerns.

Lawmakers opposed the sale due to Saudi Arabia and the UAE's involvement in the bloody conflict in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians, as well as the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi officials. They did not see any emergency that justified speeding up the transfer.

A State Department Office of Inspector General report found the agency complied with legal requirements in declaring the emergency, but did not fully assess the risks to civilians associated with that sale.

CNN investigation in February 2019 found that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had given US-made equipment to al Qaeda-linked fighters, hardline Salafi militias, and other fighting factions in Yemen, despite agreements with Washington.

During his confirmation hearing Blinken did not commit to halting the delivery of all offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia or the UAE, but he did say that the Biden administration would stop supporting the Saudi military campaign in Yemen.

""The President-elect has made clear that we will end our support for the military campaign led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen. And I think we will work on that in very short order, once the President-elect is president,"" he said at the hearing a day before the inauguration.

He also expressed particular concern about the designation of Yemen's Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization and related sanctions, telling reporters Wednesday, ""It's vitally important even in the midst of this crisis that we do everything we can to get humanitarian assistance to people of Yemen, who are in desperate need.""

""We're taking a very urgent and very close look at that. We want to make sure that not only are American aid groups able to do what they can to provide assistance but so are aid groups around the world that are providing the bulk of that assistance and to make sure that nothing we are doing interferes with that, particularly if it doesn't in any other way advance our policy and objective. So that's the priority in my book,"" he said."
Biden signed two executive orders and a memorandum Wednesday. Here's what they do,"""Today is climate day at the White House, which means that today is jobs day at the White House,"" Biden told reporters as he sought to tie his environmental push to American job creation.

This order seeks to cement the climate crisis at the center of US foreign policy and national security. Most notably, it directs the secretary of the interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters.

The order also:

Instructs Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to prepare a national intelligence estimate on the security implications of the climate crisis and directs all agencies to develop strategies for integrating climate considerations into their international work.

Establishes the National Climate Task Force, assembling leaders from across 21 federal agencies and departments.

Commits to environmental justice and new, clean infrastructure projects.

Kicks off development of emissions reduction target.

Establishes the special presidential envoy for climate on the National Security Council.

'Executive Order on Establishing President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.' This order reestablishes the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Moving forward, the council will advise Biden on policy that affects science, technology, and innovation.

Presidential Memorandum on Scientific Integrity. This memorandum charges the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy with the responsibility of ensuring scientific integrity across federal agencies

Agencies that oversee, direct or fund research are tasked with designating a senior agency employee as chief science officer to ensure agency research programs are scientifically and technologically well founded.

Is this Biden's first action on the climate crisis?

No. On his first day in office, Biden signed executive actions to rejoin the Paris climate accord and cancel the Keystone XL pipeline

He also directed agencies to review and reverse more than 100 Trump administration actions on the environment.

What's next for Biden's climate agenda?

Biden also announced Wednesday that he would be calling on Congress in the coming days to eliminate subsidies on fossil fuels

""Unlike previous administrations I don't think the federal government should give handouts to big oil to the tune of $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies,"" he told reporters.

Biden will additionally host a Leaders' Climate Summit on Earth Day, April 22, and the US will reconvene the Major Economies Forum.

What executive action is expected tomorrow?"
Pentagon receives FEMA request for military to support Covid-19 vaccinations,"(CNN) The Pentagon has received a request from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist with President Joe Biden's plan to boost Covid-19 vaccinations across the country in his first 100 days in office, the Defense Department announced Thursday.

""The department is evaluating the request, and what kinds of support it can provide. Given the significance of the request, it will be reviewed urgently but carefully to determine what DOD assets can safely be made available to support the effort,"" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement.

""As Secretary (Lloyd) Austin has said, DOD is committed to do as much as it possibly can to assist the whole-of-government effort against Covid-19,"" he added.

Both the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which FEMA is within, are in intensive discussions on how the military can help the agency, including the possibility of sending up to 10,000 troops to vaccination mega-hubs.

The effort could also involve using both active duty and National Guard forces. Part of the discussion includes agreeing on what the most urgent tasks they can handle are, two defense officials told CNN.

Fact check: Jim Jordan falsely claims Biden ordered the release of all undocumented immigrants,"Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden has already ordered significant changes to US immigration policy. But he has not issued an order that Republican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan claims he did.

Jordan said on Facebook and Twitter on Saturday that Biden issued a new order to release ""all"" undocumented immigrants. Similarly, Jordan said in a Monday interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo that Biden ""has decided he's going to release 14,000 illegals."" Fourteen thousand is the approximate number of people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention around the country.

Jordan's source for these assertions was a viral article on conservative website Breitbart News -- which has been shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook alone -- about an email sent on Thursday morning by an ICE official in Houston.

The email included the words ""release them all, immediately."" But Breitbart and then Jordan took the words way out of context.

: Neither Biden nor his administration has ordered the release of everybody in ICE detention; ICE confirmed to CNN that the viral claim is inaccurate. The Department of Justice said in a Monday court filing that certain immigrants recently released by ICE in Texas were people particularly vulnerable to harm from Covid-19, who have special pandemic-era protections under a court order from last year. The ""release them all, immediately"" directive in Houston -- which was rescinded in another internal email the next day -- was about these high-risk detainees in particular, an ICE official said in yet another internal email.

We don't have the full story about what happened with these Texas releases or with the email exchange. But it's already clear that there is no basis for the claim that Biden has mandated a mass release of every single person in ICE facilities across the US.

ICE said in a statement that it ""continues to make custody determinations on a case by case basis."" An ICE official who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity confirmed explicitly that there is no Biden order to release everyone.

A spokesman for Jordan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It's worth noting that Fox News host Tucker Carlson contradicted Jordan's claim three days before Jordan made his false claim on Bartiromo's show. Carlson, who obtained the Houston email before it was released in court, told his audience that the Biden administration's own policy memo had not itself called for the instant release of everyone in ICE detention.

The email chain

Here's a more detailed explanation of the ICE email exchange.

The Thursday email that sparked the controversy was written by an ""assistant officer in charge"" of enforcement and removal operations in ICE's Houston field office, whose name was redacted in the Justice Department court filing. The email said that they needed to stop removing immigrants from the country by midnight -- Biden's administration had ordered a 100-day deportation freeze to take effect no later than Friday -- and then continued: ""Check the HRD at 1300hrs for new review decisions. Release them all, immediately.""

Contrary to the Breitbart article, that did not mean that all undocumented immigrants around the country, or even at any Houston facility, were to be released immediately. Rather, according to another internal email released by the Justice Department in court, ""HRD means High risk detainees"" -- specifically, detainees at high risk for Covid-19.

This Friday email, written by an ICE assistant director whose name was also redacted, explained that the high-risk detainees ""are Fraihat cases."" Faour Abdallah Fraihat is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit that led a judge to order ICE last year to identify, monitor, and consider the release of detainees at elevated risk of severe harm from the coronavirus.

The Friday email said that ICE had been keeping some high-risk people in detention because ""their removal was imminent."" After Biden's freeze prevented these imminent deportations, however, ICE had to decide whether to keep the people in detention or let them go within the US. (Releasing people from detention does not mean they will never be deported.)

The Biden administration has not publicly explained how it wants his deportation freeze to interact with the provisions of the pandemic-related court order. An internal ICE email sent Friday afternoon told the sender of the Thursday ""release them all, immediately"" email to ""retract this directive immediately."" This retraction email, signed ""FOD"" (likely field office director), said supervisors should follow the Biden administration's freeze memo ""as closely to the letter as possible"" -- the memo did not say anything about immediately releasing immigrants at high risk from Covid-19 -- and that ""operational guidance is being developed and will be issued in the coming days."""

UC Berkeley removes the name on a school building over an anthropologist's controversial past,"(CNN) The University of California, Berkeley has removed the name on its anthropology building, Kroeber Hall -- named for prominent American anthropologist Alfred Kroeber -- because of his controversial history with Native Americans.

A proposal to rename the building was submitted last July to the Building Name Review Committee headed up by the school's chancellor, Carol Christ, according to the university.

Alfred Louis Kroeber, who was born in 1876, was the founder of the study of anthropology in the American West.

Campus workers removed the lettering from the exterior of Kroeber Hall.

It also names Kroeber's treatment of a Native American genocide survivor named Ishi, who is believed to have been placed as a living exhibit in Berkeley's archeological museum at the time.

The committee reached out to the campus community and received an overwhelming response of 85% in favor of the name's removal.

After reviewing the name and the history, the committee voted unanimously in October to have it removed.

It is the third name removed from a building on UC Berkeley's campus in the past year.

In her letter to the university president as to why the decision was being made, Christ stated that some of Kroeber's views and writings ""clearly stand in opposition to our university's values of inclusion and our belief in promoting diversity and excellence.""

Kroeber's name was physically removed from the building Tuesday. It will temporarily be called the Anthropology and Art Practice Building.

Anthropology professor has a proposal of her own

One of Berkeley's anthropology professors, Nancy Scheper-Hughes, wrote an op-ed on the university's blog expressing her concern and displeasure with the removal.

""The decision was not discussed with the anthropology faculty. Moreover, the 'statement' on Alfred Kroeber was woefully misinformed and in the pop style of social media ""cancel culture"", based on shaming and removing public figures thought to have done something objectionable or offensive. But ad hoc censoring without a process including factual knowledge, evidence, and research has no place in a public university,"" she wrote.

Anthropologist Alfred Kroeber (center) is photographed in 1911 near the UC Museum of Anthropology with Yahi translator Sam Batwai (left) and a Native American man named Ishi (right).

She outlined the history of Kroeber and reviewed the controversial autopsy of Ishi. The university says Ishi's body was autopsied against his wishes, which he had expressed to Kroeber.

But Scheper-Hughes said Kroeber was away on sabbatical when Ishi died and tried to keep the autopsy from happening, but failed to do so, causing him deep emotional distress.

She argued the story has been misrepresented to assume he ordered the autopsy, and though she agrees there are public figures who need to be removed, she said Kroeber is not one of them.

""Kroeber had many faults, but he was neither a neo-colonialist, nor a racist, nor a fascist,"" she said.

""If UC Berkeley erases Kroeber, the legacy of Kroeber including two brilliant women authors writing in different genres about our Californian Indigenous history will also be erased.""

She suggested a full discussion with anthropologists and representatives of Native Californian communities and leaders before renaming, and if they agree to it, renaming the building for Ishi."
"San Francisco school board votes to rename 44 schools, including Abraham Lincoln and George Washington High Schools","(CNN) The San Francisco Unified School District voted this week to rename 44 schools named after controversial public figures, including former Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and current Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

The school district, which has more than 57,000 students enrolled, is changing the schools named after historical figures linked to ""the subjugation and enslavement of human beings; or who oppressed women, inhibiting societal progress; or whose actions led to genocide; or who otherwise significantly diminished the opportunities of those amongst us to the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" according to the text of the resolution.

The school board said it commissioned a panel of community leaders and students in May 2018 to formally identify schools and set up a process for the changes.

On Tuesday, the board voted 6-1.

Schools that will be renamed include: Abraham Lincoln High School, George Washington High School, Dianne Feinstein Elementary, Roosevelt Middle School, Jefferson Elementary and Alamo Elementary.

Lincoln was chosen based on ""his treatment of First Nation peoples,"" teacher Jeremiah Jeffries told the San Francisco Chronicle in December 2020.

Washington and Jefferson were slaveowners.

Feinstein, a former San Francisco mayor, was listed for reportedly ordering a Confederate flag to be replaced after it was torn down, according to the Sacramento Bee.

The news also comes more than a year after the school board voted to cover a controversial mural depicting images of slavery and dead Native Americans at George Washington High School.

The board was partially motivated to draft the resolution after the deadly ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.

""This resolution came to the school board in the wake of the attacks in Charlottesville,"" said San Francisco Board of Education President Gabriela López. ""And we are working alongside the rest of the country to dismantle symbols of racism and White supremacy culture.""

San Francisco is not the only city to take pass such a resolution.

In recent years, city councils and school districts nationwide have renamed buildings and removed monuments dedicated to Confederate leaders who fought to preserve slavery and White supremacy in America.

In September of 2020, the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) identified more than 240 schools across the country that bear the name of a Confederate leader. More than 30 schools in the US have been renamed since 2014 in order to eliminate any link to Confederacy, according to the EJI

In a statement, San Francisco Mayor London Breed said she supports the board's decision to rename the schools.

""I understand the significance of the name of a school, and a school's name should instill a feeling of pride in every student that walks through its doors, regardless of their race, religion, or sexual orientation,"" Breed said.

""In fact, the public elementary school I attended as a child was renamed for Civil Rights icon Rosa Parks, and I believe it is a name that instills pride for the community. This is an important conversation to have, and one that we should involve our communities, our families, and our students.""

However, Breed also expressed frustration that the board has not yet created a plan for reopening schools.

The district, which comprises of 140 pre-kindergarten through 12th grade public schools, is among the many nationwide that has implemented distance learning due to the pandemic.

""What I cannot understand is why the School Board is advancing a plan to have all these schools renamed by April, when there isn't a plan to have our kids back in the classroom by then,"" Breed said.

""Our students are suffering, and we should be talking about getting them in classrooms, getting them mental health support, and getting them the resources they need in this challenging time. Our families are frustrated about a lack of a plan, and they are especially frustrated with the fact that the discussion of these plans weren't even on the agenda for last night's School Board meeting.""

The school board did not respond to CNN's request for additional comment about Breed's statement regarding planning to reopen schools.

The board said it is also seeking the public's help to suggest names for the schools by submitting them through an online form.

""I view it as an opportunity for our students to learn about the history of our school's names, including the potential new ones,"" López said. ""I am excited about the ideas schools will come up with."""
GOP threatens filibuster for Mayorkas nomination to be DHS secretary,"(CNN) Senate Republicans plan to object to any efforts to quickly confirm Alejandro Mayorkas as secretary of Homeland Security, further delaying his confirmation as the department grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic, national security concerns and President Joe Biden's ambitious immigration plans.

In confirming the GOP's plans to filibuster, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters Wednesday on Capitol Hill that ""there's a number of problems"" with Mayorkas' nomination.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has pushed to have Mayorkas confirmed quickly, but Cornyn and other Senate Republicans argue that Mayorkas hasn't been properly vetted on immigration issues and are calling for an additional hearing into his nomination. The Senate has scheduled a procedural vote to break the filibuster at 1:45 p.m. ET Thursday.

After the Senate breaks the filibuster -- which requires 51 votes -- the final confirmation vote will be Monday evening.

The use of the filibuster -- to stall nominations or legislation -- has long been a favored tool of the minority party, something Schumer did often when trying to derail and delay the Republican agenda under then-President Donald Trump. In recent days, continued use of the filibuster on legislation became a central sticking point over a resolution that would allow the 50-50 Senate to officially organize, but the stall tactic is unlikely to be gutted further in this Congress because of resistance from some moderate Democrats.

Man pleads guilty in plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer,"(CNN) One of six men federally charged on suspicion of being involved in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last year pleaded guilty Wednesday.

According to the agreement, Garbin will continue to cooperate with prosecutors against the five other defendants, all of whom have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping conspiracy

In exchange, prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence lesser than the maximum carried by the charge, which would have been life in prison.

The five other federal defendants are awaiting trial after being arrested in October, when authorities say the plot was thwarted.

The indictment alleged that between June 6 and October 7 the men conspired to ""unlawfully seize, kidnap, abduct and carry away, and hold for ransom and reward"" Whitmer, who is a Democrat. Authorities have said the men were planning to kidnap the governor from a vacation home and blow up a bridge to delay law enforcement, but they were arrested first.

In addition to the six charged in federal court, eight other people were charged in the case by the state in October.

As first reported by The Detroit News, the FBI became aware of the scheme in early 2020 through a social media group, according to the federal criminal complaint.

The case underscored the political tensions in Michigan that reached new heights as Whitmer faced backlash for restrictions she imposed earlier this year in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Observers have pointed to then-President Donald Trump's rhetoric toward the governor and her state, including a tweet in which he called on residents to ""liberate"" Michigan from the restrictions.

As part of the plea agreement, the government may call on Garbin to testify against the other five federal defendants during a trial set for March 23. Garbin has already cooperated with the government in sharing information about the plot, according to the agreement."
"Cloris Leachman, award-winning sitcom star, dead at 94","(CNN) Cloris Leachman, the acclaimed actress whose one-of-a-kind comedic flair made her a legendary figure in film and television for seven decades, has died, according to a statement from her longtime manager and representatives. She was 94.

""It's been my privilege to work with Cloris Leachman, one of the most fearless actresses of our time. There was no one like Cloris,"" said a statement from her manager, Juliet Green. ""With a single look she had the ability to break your heart or make you laugh 'till the tears ran down your face. You never knew what Cloris was going to say or do and that unpredictable quality was part of her unparalleled magic.""

Leachman died Wednesday of natural causes in Encinitas, California, according to the statement.

During her extensive career, Leachman, who was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2011, earned 22 Emmy nominations and eight Primetime Emmy awards and one Daytime Emmy Award.

Two of her statues were won for playing what was arguably her most iconic role -- cunning landlady Phyllis Lindstrom. The character originated on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and later received a spin-off series.

Some Oklahoma schools are telling kids to remember their masks or pay to get a new one,"(CNN) Some Oklahoma students will have to pay $1 to buy a new mask if they don't have one when they get to class, as part of a school district's effort to fight Covid-19 .

""We have been very accommodating and patient with students as they continue to arrive to school without a mask. We have issued reusable masks countless times to our students but now they have depleted our resources,"" the post said.

If they don't have money with them, the students will have to call a parent or guardian and ask them to bring a mask or a dollar to buy a new one.

Broken Bow is in the southeast corner of Oklahoma in McCurtain County, which borders Arkansas and Texas. The county has had 3,376 confirmed Covid-19 cases and reported 15 new cases on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University

Broken Bow High School Principal Luke Hanks told CNN that about 900 students attend his school and Rector Johnson Middle School and that the schools have gone through about 30,000 masks this school year.

They've given out many reusable masks, but Hanks said some students end up leaving them in their cars or forgetting them at home and coming back for a new one the next day.

Individual teachers get to decide whether masks are required in their classrooms, so a student may only have to wear a mask one or two periods each day, Hanks said.

Some were coming back two or three times a day because they'd lost or thrown away their masks between classes.

The Oklahoma State Department of Health recommended that all school teachers and essential public workers wear face coverings in an August 13 public health advisory

Hanks said they're not trying to punish kids, but he hopes it will teach them to be responsible and keep up with their things.

""I tell some of them, if you're required to wear them for work, what's going to happen if you don't have one in the real world,"" he said.

Hanks said that they haven't gotten any complaints from parents or the community, but he did get a call from a man who offered to donate masks after he heard about the policy.

The policy has only been in place for three days, but Hanks said it seems to be working.

They went from giving out 100 masks a day to fewer than 10 on Wednesday.

Hanks said that any money collected will be used to buy new masks, but that his bigger concern is lost instructional time.

He said going to the office to get a new mask might take five minutes, and then they disrupt the other students when they come back to class.

""We need kids in the classroom,"" he said. ""While we have in-person classes, we need to maximize every minute we have with our kids."""
CDC doesn't know if new Covid-19 variants are causing rare complication in children,"(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday it does not know if the new Covid-19 variants are causing more cases of a rare complication in children called multisystem inflammatory syndrome.

A sign encourages social distancing as Southside Christian plays Lake View during a state high school football championship game at Benedict College, December 5, 2020, in Columbia, South Carolina.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in children is a troubling complication of Covid-19 infection that can cause heart damage and typically shows up about three weeks after a child has been infected. Many MIS-C cases follow a Covid-19 infection that had no symptoms.

While children are much less likely than adults to be hospitalized or die from Covid-19, children are as just as likely as adults to become infected.

About 2.68 million children in the US have tested positive for the virus as of January 21, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the number of infections has increased recently. Last week alone, 165,480 new child cases were identified through testing, the report said. That's an 16% increase in child Covid-19 cases over two weeks. Children represent 12.7% of all cases in the US.

The CDC says that as of the end of December, it had reports of 1,659 cases of MIS-C.

Threats against lawmakers fuel safety concerns for travel outside Washington,"(CNN) As threats continue to mount against members of Congress, concern is growing about the safety of some lawmakers when they travel outside Washington and the security bubble it provides, multiple sources told CNN.

Intelligence based on social media chatter and other information, which increased after the January 6 insurrection, indicates a heightened threat for members of Congress in their home states, a law enforcement official said.

Lawmakers in both parties have been reluctant to share details about specific threats they have received in the weeks since pro-Donald Trump rioters breached the US Capitol and 10 House Republicans voted in favor of impeaching Trump for inciting the insurrection.

But CNN has learned that several members of Congress have been given extra security when traveling to and from the nation's capital.

In some cases, local police departments have been tasked with providing this additional layer of security and have even stationed officers outside lawmakers' family homes, according to two sources familiar with the situation.

Acting Sergeant-at-Arms Timothy Blodgett alluded to the role his office has played in helping to provide additional security for lawmakers in recent weeks on Tuesday during a security briefing for the House Appropriations Committee.

Employees of the House sergeant-at-arms have ""arranged for airport security, monitored threats, conducted emergency training, prepared for a presidential inauguration and are taking every effort to ensure that members of Congress are safe at the US Capitol, in their district and while traveling,"" he told lawmakers.

FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director in Charge Steven D'Antuono told reporters Tuesday that law enforcement officials continue to monitor threats around the country, adding that they're still using all the tools at their disposal to do so.

""If there are any leads that we can follow and identifying any type of intelligence or information. Leading up to any violence. Violence here ... or across the rest of the country,"" he said.

Senate and House leadership declined to comment, telling CNN they do not discuss issues related to member security.

Security concerns for members of both parties

Congressional leaders are among those who have received extra security amid the increase in threats but the more prevailing concern is about the safety of newer or lesser-known members who may not receive the same level of additional protection, sources say.

CNN has previously reported that several Republican members who voted in favor of impeachment have received death threats over their decision.

As a result, some of those lawmakers have received additional security when traveling to their home states, including protection by local police at the airport and, in some cases, where they live, multiple sources told CNN.

Even some of Trump's closest allies in Congress have faced questions about their security following January 6.

Shortly after issuing a rare rebuke of the former president for his role in instigating the Capitol attack, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was confronted and screamed at by Trump supporters at Reagan National Airport, according to videos posted on social media

""You traitor,"" a woman screams at the senator in one video as he walks through a terminal at the Washington-area airport. ""Lindsey Graham,​ you are a traitor to the country.""

A spokesperson for Graham told CNN at the time that they do not discuss security issues involving the senator but the episode remains a stark reminder of the animosity that has been directed at lawmakers who have condemned Trump's actions.

Some of the most high-profile Democratic members of Congress, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have also expressed concerns about their safety in the wake of the January 6 attack but aides have declined to say whether she has received additional security when traveling away from DC.

In response to mounting concerns from members about their safety, the Committee on House Administration circulated a letter earlier this week reminding them what security measures they could expense, and the process for beefing up their security protocols. Members can get reimbursed for purchasing bulletproof vests, for hiring security personnel in certain instances or getting their own security training, and for making a range of security enhancements to their district offices.

Additional threats

Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security warned about potential violence from extremists who object to the presidential transition, hold anti-government views or are motivated by false narratives.

Meanwhile, criminal complaints against some of the individuals who participated in the January 6 storming of the US Capitol have validated concerns about the safety of members and their families when they travel back to their home districts.

In one case, an unnamed New York-based lawmaker informed the FBI that their brother had received threatening text messages from the defendant, a man named Robert Lemke, according to court documents.

""On or about January 11, 2021, the office of Congressman-1 informed the FBI that, on or about January 6, 2021, Congressman-1's brother ('Victim-1') had received the following text messages from a particular phone number (the 'Lemke Phone'), which also included a picture of a home in neighborhood as Victim-1's home,"" the court documents say.

""Your brother is putting your entire family at risk with his lies and other words. We are armed and nearby your house. You had better have a word with him. We are not far from his either. Already spoke to [Congressman-1's son] and know where his kids are,"" the text read, according to the court documents.

The texts continue: ""... your words have consequences. Stop telling lies; Biden did not win, he will not be president. We are not white supremacists. Most of us are active/retired law enforcement or military. You are putting your family at risk. We have armed members near your home. ... Don't risk their safety with your words and lies.""

Lemke has been charged with one count of ""threatening interstate communications.""

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York confirmed on Tuesday that he was the unnamed congressman who was referenced in the complaint.

""Congressman Hakeem Jeffries is the Member of the House of Representatives referenced as 'Congressman-1' in the criminal complaint recently unsealed in Manhattan federal court,"" Jeffries' office said.

In his statement, Jeffries extended ""his deep thanks and heartfelt gratitude to the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, NYPD and all law enforcement authorities involved for their commitment to protecting the safety and well-being of his family and all Members of the United States Congress."""
This artist just became the first Native American to win the Caldecott Medal for children's book illustration,"(CNN) Michaela Goade just etched her name into the history books.

This week she became the first Native American to win the Randolph Caldecott Medal for her illustrations in the children's book ""We Are Water Protectors,"" according to the American Library Association . The Caldecott Medal is a prestigious award given annually to the artist of the most distinguished American picture book for children.

Michaela Goode is the first Native American to win the Caldecott Medal for children's book illustration.

""It's a great honor to be the first Indigenous artist to win this award, but I am of course standing on many shoulders,"" Goade, a member of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, said in a statement to CNN. ""I think it's important to acknowledge and reflect on the significance of being the first in 2021, while also looking towards the future with much hope. I won't be the last! It brings me so much joy to think about Indigenous youth who will see themselves in this recognition and know that their stories are powerful and value.""

""We Are Water Protectors"" was written by Carole Lindstrom, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Ojibwe. The story follows a young Native American girl as she takes a stand against a black snake threatening to poison her people's water, according to the book's description.

The snake, which is shaped like a pipe in the book, represents the Dakota Access Pipeline -- a controversial crude oil project that spans 1,172 miles and extends over four states -- and is a reference to the Black Snake Prophecy, according to Goade.

"Apple just had a blowout quarter, thanks to iPhone 12 sales","New York (CNN Business) Analysts have talked for at least a year about the potential for Apple's first 5G iPhone to drive a ""supercycle"" of device sales. On Wednesday, Apple's earnings report for the three months ended December 26 — the first since the iPhone 12 went on sale — offered an initial look at how actual sales are stacking up against that projection.

Strong iPhone sales pushed the company's total quarterly revenue to a record $111.4 billion — well above the $103.3 billion Wall Street analysts had predicted.posted earnings of $16.8 per diluted share, up 35% from the same period in the prior year.

iPhone sales were also even better than expected: Growing more than 17% year-over-year to nearly $65.6 billion, compared with the $59.8 billion analysts had expected. Apple executives last quarter had said they expected single-digit percentage growth in iPhone sales during the December quarter.

The total active installed base of iPhones worldwide is now over 1 billion, ""driven by strong demand for the iPhone 12,"" CEO Tim Cook said on a call with analysts Wednesday.

Despite the strong results, Apple's stock fell more than 2% in after-hours trading Wednesday.

""In our view, the iPhone 12 has been Apple's most successful product launch in the last five years,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to investors last week, ahead of the report.

The company also announced a cash dividend of $0.205 per share, payable on February 11 to shareholders of record as of close of business on February 8.

The report comes as Apple's stock has largely continued to soar in recent weeks. Its market cap this week reached an all-time record above $2.4 trillion.

""Our December quarter business performance was fueled by double-digit growth in each product category, which drove all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments and an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,"" Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in a statement.

Why so much pressure on the iPhone 12?

Hopes have been high for the iPhone 12 because it's the first Apple device that can connect to 5G, the superfast wireless networks expected to create new capabilities for consumers and businesses.

The past several iPhone releases ""haven't really given users a reason to upgrade,"" Tyler Ellegard, investment analyst at Gradient Investments, said in an interview ahead of the results. That led to disappointing iPhone sales numbers in recent years.

With the iPhone 12, experts predicted 5G connectivity could be a big enough change to encourage hundreds of millions of Apple users to upgrade. The fast download speeds and low lag time that 5G enables could make for a better experience using Apple services such as Apple Arcade.

However, there were also major questions surrounding the iPhone 12 launch: Would people really shell out for an upgrade during the economic recession caused by the pandemic? And with 5G networks still in their early days , would consumers experience enough of a difference to even want to?

D.A. Davidson Analyst Tom Forte said in a note last week that he believed Apple's lineup of 5G smartphones was ""better positioned than investors completely appreciate,"" in part because of carrier promotions

Some of the iPhone sales growth may not be because of 5G, but simply because consumers who hadn't upgraded in a few years wanted other perks, such as the iPhone 12's impressive array of camera features, Ellegard said.

Ahead of the earnings release, many analysts said they expected iPhone 12 sales would skew toward the higher-end Pro and Pro Max models. That may have contributed to the improvement in Apple's gross margin during the December quarter — overall gross margin was 39.8%, up 160 basis points from the prior quarter, and products gross margin improved by 530 basis points compared to the prior quarter.

What else are analysts watching?

The iPhone wasn't the only big Apple product to go on sale in recent months. The company also released the eighth-generation iPad and a redesigned iPad Air, the Apple Watch Series 6 and a new Mac lineup powered by chips designed in-house.

Apple's overall product sales during the quarter totaled nearly $95.7 billion. And the company's total installed base of devices grew to 1.65 billion during the December quarter.

Analysts will likely focus on Apple's services segment performance — revenue from the business grew 24% to nearly $15.8 billion. Apple now has more than 620 million paid subscriptions across its services, up from 140 million a year ago, said Maestri, the CFO, on the earnings call.

Although iPhones remain the company's biggest revenue driver, it has been working to transition to being more of a services business. Apple's fitness subscription offering, Fitness+, launched during the quarter, as did its services bundle, Apple One

""Customers are loving the flexibility, challenge and fun of these classes, as well as how pairing with Apple Watch pushes you to achieve your fitness goals,"" Cook said of Fitness+. ""With new content being added to these services everyday, we feel very optimistic about where we are headed.""

The success of Apple's stock likely has much to do with the services business, Gradient's Ellegard said.

""People are changing how they value the company,"" he said. ""It's easier to forecast future sales when you have the recurring subscriptions, and it's also a higher margin business. It's a better business model.""

During the call, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty asked Cook how he evaluates possible new markets for Apple. In recent weeks, there have been reports that the company plans to enter the virtual reality business with a headset that could launch as early as next year, as well as renewed rumors about an Apple car

""We ask ourselves if this is a product that we would want to use ourselves, or a service that we would want to use ourselves, and that's a pretty high bar,"" Cook said. ""And we ask ourselves if it's a big enough market to be in ... The kind of things that we love to work on are those where there's a requirement for hardware, software and services to come together. Because we believe that the magic really occurs at that intersection.""

Later, he added: ""We've got new things that we're not going to talk about, that we think are going to contribute to the company."""
Everything you need to know about how a Reddit group blew up GameStop's stock,"New York (CNN Business) The GameStop frenzy on Wall Street has investors, and much of the internet, enraptured — not unlike a good horror movie. Everyone knows doom is just around the corner for some key players; a lucky few will emerge stronger; and the monster might be subdued but will ultimately come back for a sequel.

The cast of characters

Who's the monster and who's the hero, in this case, depends entirely on your perspective.

On one side you have a band of mostly young day traders who coordinate on Reddit to drive up the share price of struggling companies, including, but alsoand. At least one Reddit user posted that he'd paid off thousands of dollars in student loans with his GameStop gains.

On the other you have hedge funds and short-sellers — those who've placed bets that a company's stock will crash. These are Wall Street elite, the sort of investors millions of people rely on to make the smart decisions that boost their portfolios. But they're detested by many Millennials and Gen Zers for creating a house-of-cards financial system that led to the 2008 crisis.

We're now, potentially, at the climax of this movie: GameStop is up more than 1,700% since the start of January. Some trading platforms, including TD Ameritrade and Robinhood, are restricting trades on AMC and GameStop. The SEC and the White House on Wednesday both said they were monitoring the situation.

Here's the background you need to know.

Why GameStop?

The popular Reddit page WallStreetBets is fond of targeting short-sellers. If you've ever played craps, these are the guys betting against the table, and their tactics, while often lucrative, have burnished their reputation as bloodsuckers and other, unpublishable, names. (More on that later.)

It's not hard to understand why someone would short GameStop, however. The company is expected to lose money this year and next. Sales growth is sluggish because gamers no longer need to go to the mall to buy games or consoles. That said, some investors have argued that GameStop was seriously undervalued, especially when video games have become staples of the stay-at-home pandemic era.

The GameStop stock surge began for a legitimate reason: The company announced on January 11 it had added three new directors to its board, including Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen. Investors liked that Cohen brought digital experience to the table, something the largely brick-and-mortar GameStop desperately needs, as video games go digital and malls continue their unending slump into irrelevance.

GameStop's stock rose a little less than 13% that day. But this wasn't a normal, momentary stock surge. Two days later, it rose 57%. Then 27%. The next week, it surged 10% twice and 51% another day. This week, it rose another 18% then 93% and more than doubled today.

The reason is two-fold, both of which are far removed from anything related to the company's fundamental strength: Investors following the Reddit group bought a ton of GameStop options, and short-sellers had to buy shares to cover their losing bids.

On Wednesday, while all three major stock indexes tumbled, GameStop finished up a mind-boggling 134%.

For perspective: One year ago, a single share cost about $4. It's now $200.

Not just GameStop

A similar story was playing out with shares of AMC, the movie theater chain that's been devastated by the pandemic.

Shares of the new WSB plaything were up more than 200% Wednesday after members of the Reddit board and investors on Robinhood were touting the stock. The hashtag #SaveAMC was trending on Twitter.

Both AMC and GameStop spiked so rapidly Wednesday they triggered automatic halts designed to protect against volatility.

Why is this happening now?

The way people trade stocks has been upended by the rise of no-fee apps like Robinhood. That technology has democratized investing, giving armchair investors far removed from traditional banks free access to sophisticated trading instruments, like options.

You could pay an analyst to tell you what stocks to buy, or you could create a Reddit account and follow forums like WallStreetBets. Millions of young people are opting for the latter, which is partly why the sudden surges in GameStop and AMC have caught Wall Street veterans by surprise.

What's an option?

Options are bets investors place on a stock, allowing them to buy (a ""call"" option) or sell (a ""put"" option) at a particular price. That allows people to wager on whether a stock will rise or fall.

Investors can place relatively inexpensive options bets and sell those options as they rise in value when the stock price gets closer to their wager. Although buying and selling options isn't the same as buying and selling stocks, big options volumes can drive a stock up or down, typically because options traders buy or sell the stock itself as a hedge.

In the case of GameStop and other stocks targeted by WSB, traders keep buying options, forcing the investors selling those options to hedge their bets by buying up GameStop stock.

What's a short?

Short-sellers are investors who bet that a stock is going to fall. They borrow shares to sell on the market with the promise to buy back those shares at a later date. If they win the bet, they sold high and bought low, and they walk away with money in the bank.

If they lose the bet, that's called a short-squeeze, and they often hedge their losses by buying more shares of the company they bet against.

Short interest in GameStop surged toward the end of the year, as investors bet against the company's earnings potential. With a mega short-squeeze taking place, short-sellers began to hedge their bets, buying more stock to make up for their mounting losses.

Fueling the fire

WallStreetBets, which has more than 2 million followers, is littered with posts cheering the stock gains and no small amount of righteous indignation.

""What I think is happening is that you guys are making such an impact that these fat cats are worried that they have to get up and put in work to earn a living,"" a moderator in the group posted this week .""That fuzzy sensation you are feeling is called RESPECT and it is well earned. Wall Street no longer dismisses your presence anymore.""

Elon Musk appeared to join the pile-on Tuesday with a single-word tweet — ""Gamestonk!!"" — that linked to WallStreetBets. Tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya dipped his toe in the frenzy, buying call options on Tuesday but closing his position Wednesday, he told CNBC . Palihapitiya said he would donate his profits to charity and defended the retail-investing phenomenon playing out on Reddit.

""Instead of having 'idea dinners' or quiet whispered conversations amongst hedge funds in the Hamptons, these kids have the courage to do it transparently in a forum,"" he said. ""What it proves is this retail [investor] phenomenon is here to stay.""

Isn't this a bubble?

It sure is.

There's an argument that GameStop was undervalued, but hardly anyone believes that GameStop, BlackBerry, Macy's, AMC, or any of the other companies that WSB is promoting have fundamentals to support these surging stock prices. At some point, reality has to set in.

But that's the problem with bubbles — get out too early, and you lose at a chance to cash out on top. So GameStop keeps surging ... until it won't anymore.

The GameStop saga is a battle of new school vs. old school, amateur vs. professional, rebels vs. the establishment.

At the moment, the kids are winning. But, like all bubbles, this one's going to burst at some point.

Alcohol and your heart: Just getting a buzz can trigger an irregular rhythm,"(CNN) The effects of alcohol on your heart can be immediate, triggering an irregular rhythm called atrial fibrillation or AFib, according to new state-of-the-art research.

""Ours is the first study to point to a mechanism through which a lifestyle factor can acutely change the electrical properties of the heart to increase the chance of an arrhythmia,"" said study author Dr. Gregory Marcus, the associate chief of cardiology for research at the University of California, San Francisco.

The research on atrial fibrillation, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Clinical Electrophysiology, was unique because it was a randomized, double-blinded clinical study -- considered the ""gold standard"" in research.

Marcus and his team put 100 heart patients with diagnosed AFib -- the most common life-threatening heart-rhythm disorder -- under anesthesia and then injected them with enough booze to bring their blood alcohol level to .08% -- just above the legal limit in the United States.

The change they saw was startling: Alcohol appeared to immediately affect the heart's natural recovery period in a way that could trigger an atrial fibrillation event.

""The electrical changes we observed in the pulmonary veins ... would enhance both the chance that atrial fibrillation will occur immediately, and would be maintained,"" Marcus said.

""It is a first-in-human demonstration of the immediate effects of alcohol, directly on the heart,"" said Dr. Marco Perez, director of the Inherited Cardiac Arrhythmia Clinic at Stanford University Medical Center, who was not involved in the research.

""This study, however, does not address the question of whether or not moderate drinking is 'good or bad' for the heart, particularly in the long-term,"" Marcus added. ""It merely helps us understand the possible mechanisms behind the observations that people who drink have higher rates of arrhythmias.""

A growing concern

AFib is an irregular heartbeat often described by many sufferers as a ""quiver,"" ""flutter"" or ""flip-flop"" of the heart in the chest.

Atrial fibrillation is the leading cause of stroke in the United States, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention . In addition, strokes connected to AFib tend to be ""more severe than strokes with other underlying causes,"" the CDC said.

It can lead to blood clots, heart failure and other heart-related complications.

""It also can increase the risk for heart attack, for dementia, for kidney disease. All of those things are likely long term risks,"" Marcus said.

At least 2.7 million Americans are living with AFib, according to the American Heart Association. Many of those suffer chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath and fatigue. But for others, AFib is symptomless, a potentially silent killer.

The rate of AFib in the US population is growing: The CDC estimates some 12.1 million Americans will have AFib by 2030. In Europe, some 17.9 million are expected to suffer from the condition by 2060.

""Age is one of the most important risk factors, so with the aging of the population it's becoming more common,"" Marcus said.

The epidemic of obesity is also contributing to the growing numbers, along with other risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking and yes, drinking alcohol.

Studies have long shown that drinking was a risk factor for AFib, but no one knew why.

""There's a long history now of evidence that alcohol may increase the risk for atrial fibrillation, contrary to the findings regarding coronary artery disease or risks of heart attack,"" Marcus said.

That, of course, flies in the face of what we have often been told in the past -- drinking in moderation might actually help the heart.

""This is a critically important distinction,"" Marcus said. ""Many in the lay public easily conflate different forms of heart disease -- making the assumption when one refers to heart disease, they mean a heart attack or a blockage of a coronary arteries supplying blood to the heart.

""So it may very well be the case that alcohol -- at least in moderation -- could be healthy for some types of heart disease and harmful for other types of heart disease,"" Marcus said.

Is alcohol really good for the heart?

Some studies, however, are beginning to question the benefits of any alcohol for the heart.

""There are studies indeed reporting a benefit to moderate drinking, but these are not 'randomized, controlled' studies, and are likely confounded by the fact that people who engage in mild to moderate drinking may do other things (like exercise) that are good for the heart,"" Perez said in an email.

""However, there are some genetic studies that suggest that even modest alcohol use has a detrimental effect on clinical outcomes,"" Perez added.

Women who drink are at a higher risk for breast cancer . Alcohol contributes about 6% of the overall risk, possibly because it raises certain dangerous hormones in the blood.

Drinking can also increase the chance you might develop bowel, liver, mouth and oral cancers

2018 study co-authored by University of Cambridge epidemiologist Steven Bell found that while drinking was beneficial in lowering the risk for heart attack, even one drink a day shortened life expectancy. Reducing alcohol use added one to two years to life expectancy at age 40, Bell said in a prior interview.

According to Bell, the ""take-home message"" from his study is that ""people shouldn't drink under the belief that it will lower their risk of disease.""

""And those of us who opt to drink should minimize our intake if we wish to prolong our life and well-being,"" Bell said."
Oklahoma state officials are trying to return the state's $2 million stockpile of hydroxychloroquine,"(CNN) Oklahoma state officials are trying to return the state's $2 million stockpile of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine -- which had been touted by some as a treatment for Covid-19 -- back to the medical distributer.

In July, the US Food and Drug Administration revoked an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19. The agency now says hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19.

""We are working with the department of health to try to return the stockpile,"" Oklahoma Attorney General's Office Communications Director Alex Gerszewsk confirmed to CNN in an email.

Gerszewski did not provide further details on the effort."
"Your sleep could be dictated by the phases of the moon, a study says","(CNN) The moon dictates the pushes and pulls of the tides, but it could also affect our sleep.

As we head toward the first full moon of the year on Thursday night, take note: In the days leading up to a full moon, people go to bed later and sleep less, according to a study published in Science Advances on Wednesday.

On average, participants went to bed 30 minutes later and slept 50 minutes less on nights before a full moon, said study coauthor Horacio de la Iglesia, professor at the department of biology at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Researchers outfitted each participant with a sleep monitor on their wrist to track sleep schedules over the course of one to two lunar cycles. A lunar cycle takes 29.5 days to complete.

Ninety-eight people from three different Toba Indigenous communities, also known as the Qom people, in Argentina participated in the study.

AMC is today's GameStop. A Reddit mob sent its stock more than 200% higher,"A group on Reddit's Wall Street Bets board have been promoting a number of stocks, hoping to squeeze short sellers that have been betting against them.

They're succeeding. Their best-known bet is, which rose another 133% Wednesday after nearly doubling Tuesday. It has now soared about 1,700% this year.

Today's target:, the (very) struggling theater chain that just announced a nearly $1 billion lifeline to stay open.

Shares of the new WSB plaything skyrocketed more than 230% Wednesday after members of the Reddit board and investors on online brokerage firm Robinhood were touting the stock and got #SaveAMC trending on Twitter.

Both stocks had their trading occasionally halted for volatility Wednesday. And the dramatic spikes caused at least one top online broker, TD Ameritrade, to curb trading in the two companies.

Charles Schwab SCHW ""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in GameStop, AMC and other securities,"" said a spokesperson for TD Amerirtrade, which is no owned by

""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,"" the TD Ameritrade spokesperson added.

AMC is struggling financially -- just like GameStop -- and is a favorite stock of short sellers . AMC wasn't exactly a top performer before the pandemic, and the massive drop-off in theater attendance over the past 10 months sent it scrambling for cash. Last year, the company said it doubted its ability to stay in business.

But AMC's CEO told CNN Business Tuesday he is now hopeful (after an influx of cash) that the company can ride out the pandemic until people are ready go back to theaters. That's a bold bet -- blockbusters like the new James Bond movie keep getting pushed back, and CNN parent company WarnerMedia pledged to release all of its Warner Bros. titles simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max.

Similarly, GameStop may have been oversold and due for a comeback : Investors on social media had been arguing that GameStop was seriously undervalued and cheered earlier this month when the company added Chewy founder Ryan Cohen, who has been pushing a digital overhaul, to its board. Also, video games are a hot commodity in the stay-at-home era, particularly after the launches of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

But GameStop faces many of the same problems that other retailers face. It was struggling before the pandemic, as video games went digital and Amazon began eating into its market share. With malls dying across the world, those fundamentals aren't about to change -- and certainly haven't changed so dramatically in the past few days and weeks to send its stock soaring nearly 700%.

That's why this Reddit saga isn't just about fundamentals.

BlackBerry BB The reason GameStop, AMC,and a bunch of other stock picks from the WSB group are soaring is because the way people trade stocks has changed dramatically. No-fee apps like Robinhood democratize access to financial markets. Who needs high-paid Wall Street analysts when you can get stock tips for free on Reddit?

Although the hive mind of WSB poses some real dangers of a bubble mentality, there's no arguing with their success. Short-sellers rushing in to hedge their bets and cover their positions are keeping Reddit's stocks soaring with no signs of stopping.

Two questions remain: Who's next? And what happens when the bubble bursts?

Donald Trump's final economic report card could be very underwhelming,"New York (CNN Business) Economists are grading on a curve. That's not a good thing if you're former President Donald Trump.

US gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, is forecast to have grown at an annualized rate of 4% between October and December.

In a normal year, that would be something to celebrate -- an A+ for Trump's final economic report card. But 2020 was no normal year.

So if 33.4% isn't good enough, 4% sure ain't gonna cut it, either. It would get the nation only a small part of the way back to its pre-pandemic strength -- underscoring just how far we still have to go."
Blinken to State Dept. staff: 'It's a new day for America; it's a new day for the world',"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to his workforce for the first time as top US diplomat Wednesday, telling them that ""it's a new day for America; it's a new day for the world.""

Making his formal arrival at America's oldest Cabinet agency, Blinken greeted a carefully chosen sample of State Department employees with a message meant to convey solidarity and an understanding of the unparalleled difficulties facing his team -- at home in the US, within the State Department itself and abroad. His main message to the crowd: I am one of you, so I understand what you do, I am ready to lead you all in a moment of unprecedented challenges, and I will work to revive the department.

Blinken directly addressed the demolition of morale in the building during former Secretary Mike Pompeo's tenure. And he pledged to meet the challenges of the world as it is, not as it was, nodding to both the Covid-19 pandemic and the aftermath of the deadly siege on the US Capitol -- both topics that Pompeo largely avoided discussing in his final months at the Department.

""I know that the State Department I'm walking into today is not the same one I left four years ago,"" referencing his time as deputy secretary of state. ""A lot has changed. The world has changed. The Department has changed.""

Those changes will present serious challenges for the new secretary, all of which will be turbocharged by Democrats now in control of Congress and eager to see their long ignored priorities acted upon.

On the world stage, the US faces the immediate task of negotiating an extension to the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with Russia, even as it deals with Moscow's suspected cyber hack of US government agencies and businesses, and its continued work to undermine democracy in the US and Europe.

Blinken will be part of a Biden administration team that will work on returning the US to some version of the Iran nuclear deal, an undertaking that will be as tough to negotiate with Iran as it will be with Congress. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to simmer and Saudi Arabia's conflict with Iran-backed rebels in Yemen has created a humanitarian disaster causing widespread starvation.

Even as Vice President Kamala Harris swore Blinken in, his hand resting on a small pocket-sized copy of the Constitution as he stood in her ceremonial office Wednesday, lawmakers sent the newly minted secretary a letter demanding he scrutinize and overhaul the US-Saudi relationship, freezing arms deliveries, addressing the Kingdom's treatment of Americans held there, addressing ""fundamental human rights"" and the ""catastrophe in Yemen.""

In Asia, North Korea's despotic leader has an even larger nuclear arsenal than he had four years ago. And China's increasingly assertive role on the world stage as a near-peer competitor -- one that often operates outside established rules and seeks to undermine US global leadership -- requires Blinken to help craft a long-term strategy that also enables Washington to cooperate with Beijing where necessary.

Genocide

Meanwhile, traditional US allies are wary after four years of unpredictable and sometimes abusive treatment by the former president.

Blinken addressed some of the global challenges ahead in his first news conference with reporters Wednesday afternoon.

The secretary said the Biden administration is reviewing Russia's jailing of opposition activist Alexey Navalny and ""actions that are of deep concern to us, whether it is the treatment of Mr. Navalny and particularly the apparent use of a chemical weapon in an attempt to assassinate him.""

He reiterated his comments from his Senate confirmation hearing that ""it remains striking to me how concerned, and maybe even scared, the Russian government seems to be of one man, Mr. Navalny.""

Blinken also said the administration is looking ""very urgently"" at the SolarWinds hack of dozens of US government agencies and businesses that is attributed to Russia, as well as reports that Moscow had put bounties on American forces in Afghanistan, ""and of course, we're looking at these questions of election interference.""

On China, Blinken said his ""judgment remains that genocide was committed against the Uighurs. And that hasn't changed.""

Biden and his team have been explicit about wanting US foreign policy to improve the lives of Americans, and Blinken acknowledged the extraordinary set of crises at home, where the surging pandemic continues to kill Americans, the economy is struggling and people are absorbing disturbing details about the attempted insurrection encouraged by the former president.

""We need only look around to see that. I'm speaking ... to a nearly empty lobby. The people who are here are wearing masks. To date, the pandemic has claimed the lives of five State Department American employees and 42 locally employed staff around the world. Many more have gotten sick,"" he said when he greeted staff. ""And outside our doors, our government buildings are surrounded by new barricades.""

'We've never been in a moment quite like this'

""We've never been in a moment quite like this before. The President is committed to getting us through it as quickly as possible, so that soon, we can all gather in person again, travel freely again, and have confidence that the foundations of our democracy are strong,"" Blinken said.

The newly minted top US diplomat pledged to listen and to maintain transparent communication with his workforce, a nod to the dissenting views that were often ignored during Pompeo's tenure. He committed to building a diverse workforce. He also offered praise to the diplomats and career officials who were denigrated under the Trump administration.

Blinken said when he first arrived at the department 28 years ago, ""it didn't not take me long to figure out one thing, and that's how much talent and expertise that resides in this building is so important and so important to listen to the women and men of the State Department when thinking about America's place in the world and our foreign policy,"" he said.

""Your knowledge, your experience, your generosity was the springboard that landed me here today,"" Blinken said.

The new secretary will have to contend with wariness and perhaps even some skepticism about whether he will make good on his declarations of respect for career staff. Some current and former diplomats point to the fact that none of the top appointments made so far include career staff and instead, political appointees or former diplomats who left the State Department are being brought back.

""You do not have at State anyone who is current career"" in the top ranks of Blinken's leadership team, said Brett Bruen, a former diplomat and now president at Global Situation Room. Bruen argues the last four years have been so disruptive that Blinken needs to include leaders who lived through it at the department. ""Those who have been named have managed to morph into political creatures. It's great that they have had careers in diplomacy, but in many cases, it's not relevant to today.""

State Department officials say more appointments are coming that will include career staff. On Wednesday, Blinken made a concerted effort to convey appreciation for his nearly 70,000-strong workforce.

'On your team'

""To all the State Department personnel worldwide and to the women and men of USAID, whose work exemplifies America as its best -- I want you to know how proud of every single one of you and how I am to be on your team,"" Blinken said. ""Whether you're diplomats or development workers, members of the foreign service or the civil service, locally employed staff, contractors -- you do hard things very, very well.""

""These jobs demand sacrifice, and they can be dangerous. The names engraved on the walls here in our lobby remind us of that,"" he said, referencing the names of fallen diplomats. ""We honor them by coming to work every day and doing our absolute best for the American people and for each other.""

Blinken added, ""I cannot promise that you will support every choice I make as your secretary. But I can promise an open door and an open mind.""

""I will be forthright with you, because transparency makes us stronger,"" he said. ""I will seek out dissenting views and listen to the experts, because that's how the best decisions are made. And I will insist that you speak and speak up without fear or favor. And I will have your back.""

Pompeo committed to restoring the swagger of the department during his first remarks to staff, whereas Blinken placed emphasis on his commitment uphold American values, and suggested they had been ignored under the previous administration.

""America's values are noble and powerful -- and we will recommit to them,"" he said, pledging to pursue ""a foreign policy that delivers real benefits to American families, protects their safety, advances their opportunities, honors their values, and leaves their children and grandchildren a healthier and more peaceful world.""

Blinken also celebrated the history of nonpartisanship by career diplomats and secretaries of state -- a tradition that Pompeo upended.

""All we ask is that you serve the US, the Constitution, and the President to the best of your ability,"" Blinken said.

Blinken called Wednesday a ""homecoming,"" citing his first job in the building nearly three decades ago, his experience as deputy secretary, his wife's experience at a top official in the building.

Blinken was introduced by Daniel Smith, a career diplomat who served as acting secretary of state and led the transition efforts at the department.

""The department's been in excellent hands with you,"" Blinken told him.

According to spokesperson Ned Price, Blinken was greeted outdoors ""by approximately 30 of the women and men representing a small cross-section of the larger workforce"" prior to his remarks.

""Among those taking part will be representatives of the Department's employee affinity groups as well as members of the workforce from different bureaus and career tracks. Participants will also be in different stages of their careers -- some very senior and some relatively junior -- and will represent many of the functions that are so critical to our operations, whether that's custodial support or policymaking,"" Price said."
Homeland Security issues bulletin over heightened threat environment following inauguration,"(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday issued a threat bulletin due to the ongoing potential for violence in the wake of the presidential inauguration, including concerns that domestic extremists may be emboldened by the attack on the US Capitol.

Acting DHS Secretary David Pekoske issued the National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin ""due to a heightened threat environment across the United States,"" which DHS believes will persist in the weeks following the January 20 presidential inauguration.

""Information suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence,"" the bulletin reads.

Earlier this month, CNN reported that discussions were underway about raising the terrorism threat level, according to two sources familiar with the discussions at the time.

The National Terrorism Advisory System -- which replaced color-coded alerts of the Homeland Security Advisory System -- falls under the Department of Homeland Security.

The last advisory issued stemmed from an Iran-related terrorism threat to the United States last January and has since expired.

A bulletin is used to describe current developments or general trends regarding threats of terrorism. The department can also issue an ""elevated"" or ""imminent"" alert, which warns of credible or impending terrorism threats.

Wednesday's bulletin, which is set to expire in April, comes as the confirmation of Biden's pick for Homeland Security Secretary secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, is being held up in the Senate

The bulletin reiterates several concerns about domestic extremists that the department has warned about over the past year, including anger over Covid-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results and police use of force.

Long-standing racial and ethnic tension -- including opposition to immigration -- has driven domestic violent extremist attacks in the past, including a 2019 shooting in El Paso, Texas, that killed 23 people, according to the bulletin.

In addition, DHS said some domestic extremists may be emboldened by the January 6 breach of the US Capitol to target elected officials and government facilities.

DHS also warned that homegrown extremists inspired by foreign terrorist groups may remain a threat.

Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst, said Wednesday that the bulletin goes directly after the ""big lie"" -- the false narrative that former President Donald Trump won the election -- and those who push it. ""This (bulletin) is a take no prisoners approach. And totally appropriate,"" she said, adding that she's never seen anything like this for domestic violent extremism.

On January 6, rioters breached the Capitol after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to confirm then-President-elect Joe Biden's win.

At least 150 people have now been charged by federal prosecutors in connection with the insurrection at the Capitol, which left five people dead according to a CNN review of court records and Justice Department announcements.

Earlier this week, the US House transmitted to the Senate an article of impeachment against Trump for inciting insurrection. After becoming the first president in history to be impeached twice, Trump faces a trial in the Senate.

""While the DHS alert said absolutely nothing new, there's value in soliciting the public's assistance in identifying and alerting authorities about suspicious activity. The watchful public will always be the best 'eyes and ears' for law enforcement,"" Brian Harrell, former DHS assistant secretary for infrastructure protection, said Wednesday.

Former Trump administration acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told CNN earlier this month that there are ""limits"" to the usefulness of the National Terrorism Advistory System bulletins. He said the primary use is for education and awareness.

In the wake of the Capitol attack, a joint bulletin from DHS, the FBI and eight other agencies warned that domestic extremists posed the most likely threat to the presidential inauguration, particularly those who believed the new administration is illegitimate.

The assessment, dated January 14, also noted that since the attack on the US Capitol, Russian, Iranian and Chinese influence actors have ""seized the opportunity to amplify narratives in furtherance of their policy interest amid the presidential transition,"" adding that there was a lack of specific, credible information indicating that they were seeking to commit violence.

In October, DHS' first annual homeland threat assessment said that White supremacist extremists would remain the deadliest domestic terror threat to the United States. Since 2018, White supremacists have conducted more lethal attacks in the US than any other domestic extremist movement, demonstrating a ""longstanding intent"" to target racial and religious minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, politicians and those they believe promote multiculturalism and globalization, according to the report.

Senate Republicans are objecting to any efforts to quickly confirm Mayorkas, further delaying his confirmation as the department grapples with national security concerns, as well as the coronavirus pandemic and Biden's immigration plans.

In confirming the GOP's plans to filibuster Biden's nominee, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters Wednesday on Capitol Hill that ""there's a number of problems"" with Mayorkas' nomination.

While several of Biden's nominees have been confirmed after moving at a slower pace than some of his predecessors' Cabinet picks, Republicans had not previously threatened to filibuster a nominee.

Democratic lawmakers, the Biden administration, former Homeland Security secretaries and others have urged the swift confirmation of Mayorkas, arguing that it is vital for national security.

How to get the most Covid financial relief when filing your taxes this year,"But there is very good reason for everyone to file a federal tax return this year, even if your 2020 income was so low that the IRS doesn't require you to file

You could get back more money than you think, or at least lower your tax bill. A number of Covid relief provisions may be claimed in full only through your tax return. Some tax credit rules have become more advantageous as a result of the pandemic. And you may find yourself eligible for some tax breaks for the first time due to Covid.

The IRS will start accepting returns on February 12, and the filing deadline is April 15, unless you apply for an automatic extension.

But by filing on time you will avoid being charged a penalty for filing late and potentially a penalty for failure to pay if you still owe any taxes to the IRS.

Claiming the most stimulus for which you're eligible

payments from the federal government, filing your federal tax return will be the best way to get the full amount of the two economic impact payments for which you're eligible. If you earned less than $75,000 as a single person, $112,500 as head of household or $150,000 as a married couple in 2020 and didn't already receive Covid relief payments from the federal government, filing your federal tax return will be the best way to get the full amount of the two economic impact payments for which you're eligible.

The IRS sent out two payments so far -- the first was for up to $1,200 per adult, and the second for up to $600 , with even more money going to those who had dependent children.

But anyone who didn't file a federal tax return in 2019 or whose 2019 income was above the 2020 income eligibility thresholds for the stimulus payments may not have received what they are owed. That's because the IRS, for the sake of speed, shipped out payments based on the 2019 tax information it had as well as information it had for Social Security recipients.

The same situation may have affected parents who got a divorce in 2020, said Elaine Maag, a principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

It's possible the IRS sent the family's full stimulus payment to the non-custodial parent.

In that case, Maag noted, the IRS will not require non-custodial ex-spouses to pay back any of the money they erroneously got. And it will still send a duplicate payment to the parent who can prove their custodial status last year.

But to get the payment you're owed, you must claim the refundable Recovery Rebate Credit. The credit will be awarded in the same amount as the stimulus payment for which you are eligible. Refundable credits reduce your tax liability dollar-for-dollar. If a credit exceeds your tax liability, the rest will be sent to you as a refund.

You may be eligible for an Earned Income Tax Credit

Given how difficult 2020 was financially for so many people, you may qualify for another tax break -- the refundable Earned Income Tax Credit -- which is geared toward rewarding work for low- and moderate-income filers.

IRS To be eligible for the EITC, your income must be below certain thresholds depending on the number of children you have. For instance, for tax year 2020, your adjusted gross income can't be above $21,210 if you are a childless married couple, but can go as high $56,844 if you have three kids. (There are other factors that go into determining EITC eligibilty detailed in thisIRS summary .)

The credit is worth up to $6,660 for married couples with children and up to $538 for single, childless filers.

you. Plus, the rules for the EITC have been tweaked to provide more Covid relief for those who qualify. You may choose whether to base your EITC on your 2019 or 2020 income, whichever would be most advantageous foryou.

the refundable That same lookback provision will also apply if you qualify forthe refundable Child Tax Credit

""In both cases, if you earned less in 2020 than in 2019, you can calculate your credits based on 2019 earnings or 2020 earnings. You can choose a different year for each credit,"" Maag said.

Small business owners will enjoy supercharged deductions

Small business owners who paid business expenses using money from a Paycheck Protection Program loan that was forgiven may still deduct those expenses on their federal tax return as if they paid for them out of revenue.

And the forgiven loan will be treated as tax free to the small business owner."
Wisconsin pharmacist to plead guilty to tampering with Covid-19 vaccine vials,"(CNN) The Wisconsin hospital pharmacist who in December allegedly removed 57 vials of Covid-19 vaccine from cold storage because he believed the vaccine could harm people has signed a plea agreement ""acknowledging that he was guilty"" of trying to make the vaccine ineffective, the Department of Justice said.

Steven Brandenburg, 46, is charged with two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products, ""with reckless disregard for the risk that another person will be placed in danger of death or bodily injury,"" the department said in a release.

Brandenburg removed a storage container with 57 vials, containing more than 500 doses of the Moderna vaccine, at the Aurora Medical Center in Grafton on December 24 and 25, according to police. The vaccine must be kept cold to remain effective.

""Tampering with vaccine doses in the midst of a global health crisis calls for a strong response, as reflected by the serious charges the United States has brought today,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Department of Justice's Civil Division.

CNN has reached out to an attorney for Brandenburg for comment.

"CDC projects up to 514,000 US Covid-19 deaths by February 20","British Home Secretary Priti Patel speaks during a media briefing in London on January 21. Matt Dunham/WPA Pool/Getty Images

Under new UK border regulations, people exiting Britain must explain their reasons for travelling, British Home Secretary Priti Patel said on Wednesday.

Whilst announcing the new measures to reduce travel in Parliament, Patel said the ""rules are clear"" and people should stay at home unless they have a valid reason to leave.

""We will introduce a new requirement so that people wishing to travel must first make a declaration as to why they need to travel. This reason to travel will be checked by carriers prior to departure,"" Patel said.

She added that the government would heighten police enforcement of coronavirus travel restrictions and anyone found not to have a valid reason for travel would either be ""directed home"" or ""face a fine.""

Earlier on Wednesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was set to introduce accommodations (for example hotels) for a 10 day quarantine for those who cannot be refused entry into the UK from high-risk countries.

The Home Secretary reiterated that the travelers would be people who can't be turned away but added that they will be arriving from red list countries where the UK has already imposed international travel bans.

""They will be required to isolate for ten days without exception,"" Patel said, adding that the Department for Health and Social Care will set out further details on the hotel quarantine process next week.

""We will continue to refuse entry to non-UK residents from red list countries which are already subject to the UK travel ban,"" she said."
Leahy said he had 'muscle spasms' on Tuesday night but has been cleared for a full return,"(CNN) Sen. Patrick Leahy, the president pro tempore of the Senate, said Wednesday that he went to the hospital Tuesday night because of ""muscle spasms"" he had been experiencing.

Doctors, he told CNN, have since cleared him for a full return to his schedule and to preside over the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, scheduled to kick off in full next month.

""The nice thing about medicine is I was able to have a registered nurse come home and spend the night with me,"" the 80-year-old Leahy said, referring to his wife of nearly 60 years.

Asked by CNN if he would run for reelection next year in Vermont, Leahy said he usually makes a decision on whether to run in the November or December before an election year -- and would do so again after spending time skiing and show shoeing. He said ""of course"" he could serve out the rest of his current term.

""The latest poll shows me winning easily,"" Leahy said confidently. ""You all know this, I never make up my mind 'til November or December the year before -- and I'm not going to do (it earlier) now.""

"Almost two-thirds of people believe climate change is a global emergency, UN poll finds","(CNN) Nearly two-thirds of respondents believe that climate change is a ""global emergency,"" according to a survey of 1.2 million people in dozens of countries around the globe -- and many want urgent action to tackle the problem.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which ran the poll with Oxford University, described it as the largest survey of public opinion on climate change ever conducted. Unusually, it captured the views of more than half a million people under the age of 18, a key but typically hard-to-reach constituency, the organization said.

The ""Peoples' Climate Vote"" was undertaken late last year in 50 high, middle and low income countries that together account for more than half of the world's population over the age of 14, according to the UNDP report.

Across those countries, 64% of people said climate change was an emergency, ""presenting a clear and convincing call for decision-makers to step up on ambition,"" the report said.

""Of the people that said climate change is a global emergency, 59% said that the world should do everything necessary and urgently in response,"" it added. A further 20% backed acting slowly, while 10% thought the world was already doing enough.

While younger people showed the greatest concern over climate change, with 69% of those aged 14-17 saying there is a climate emergency, around two-thirds of those aged 18 to 59 and 58% of those aged 60 and over agreed. This illustrates ""how widely held this view has become,"" the UNDP said.

Its polling also indicated that majorities backed climate action even when it would have a significant impact on their own country, at a time when much of the world is reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

'Broad support' for action

Respondents were asked where they would most like to see action, with questions on support for 18 policy options across six areas -- energy, economy, transportation, farms and food, protecting people, and nature.

Four climate policies emerged as the most popular globally, with 54% of those surveyed favoring conservation of forests and land, 53% choosing increased use of renewable energy, 52% supporting climate-friendly farming techniques and 50% wanting more investment in green businesses and jobs. The promotion of plant-based diets was the least popular, with only 30% support.

There were ""clear calls"" for renewable energy even in higher emitting countries such as the United States, Australia and Canada, the UNDP report said.

It also found ""strong backing"" for action to conserve forests and land in countries with high emissions from deforestation and land-use change, such as Brazil, Indonesia and Argentina.

""The results of the survey clearly illustrate that urgent climate action has broad support amongst people around the globe, across nationalities, age, gender and education level,"" Achim Steiner, UNDP administrator, said in a news release.

""From climate-friendly farming to protecting nature, and investing in a green recovery from Covid-19, the survey brings the voice of the people to the forefront of the climate debate. It signals ways in which countries can move forward with public support as we work together to tackle this enormous challenge,"" he said.

The publication of the survey comes as many countries are preparing for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.

In the United States, President Joe Biden has put action to combat climate change high on his agenda. He is expected to sign several executive actions related to climate on Wednesday, including issuing a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands, according to a person familiar with his plans.

This follows on from a series of steps last week aimed at reprioritizing environmental issues. Biden halted more than 100 regulatory actions taken by the Trump administration, announced the US would rejoin the Paris climate agreement and canceled the Keystone XL pipeline.

'Unconventional approach'

The UNDP poll was undertaken as part of a wider UN campaign to educate people about climate change solutions and ask their opinions on actions to address the climate crisis.

Global average temperatures last year were tied for the hottest on record , capping what was also the planet's hottest decade ever recorded, according to data analysis released earlier this month. The last six years are now the hottest six on record, with 2020 on par with 2016 as the hottest year ever recorded.

The highest level of public belief in the climate emergency, at 74%, was found in people living in small island developing states, the UNDP report said, followed by people in high income countries (72%). It stood at 62% in middle income countries, while the least developed countries saw the lowest level of support, at 58%.

A majority across all regions said climate change was a global emergency, with the highest level of agreement in Western Europe and North America, at 72%, and the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa, at 61%.

The UNDP poll sought to reach people under the age of 18 by distributing its questions through adverts in game apps on mobile phones. This ""new and unconventional approach to polling"" allowed its authors to reach ""a huge, unique, and random sample of people of all genders, ages, and educational backgrounds,"" the UNDP said.

The poll found that the more education a person had completed, the more likely they were to think there was a climate emergency, regardless of where they lived.

""With the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, the Peoples' Climate Vote took on added meaning by providing insight into perceptions about the climate crisis in the context of a global pandemic,"" the report said.

""Many of the policy choices in the Peoples' Climate Vote -- whether relating to jobs, energy, protecting nature or company regulation -- speak to issues that countries are facing as they chart their recoveries.""

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the public level of belief in the climate emergency as the level of support for climate action. It also included a graphic that mischaracterized the United Nations Development Programme survey's methodology. The story has been corrected and the graphic has been removed. The story has also been updated to clarify the surveyed population's age range."

TikTok is laying off employees in India as ban becomes permanent,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) TikTok has been forced to lay off some of its workers in India as the country doubles down on what was already a monthslong ban on the app in the country.

The popular short video app announced Wednesday that it will cut workers in India after it had ""not been given a clear direction on how and when our apps could be reinstated.""

""It is deeply regretful that after supporting our 2000+ employees in India for more than half a year, we have no choice but to scale back the size of our workforce,"" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.

TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, did not say how many workers would be affected, and it did not immediately respond to a request for comment for more detail.

TikTok made its decision public days after Indian media reported that the country plans to make permanent a ban on 59 Chinese apps that were blocked last June, including TikTok, Tencent's WeChat and Alibaba's UC Browser. Indian regulators at the time claimed that the apps posed a ""threat to sovereignty and integrity.""

Microsoft patented a chatbot that would let you talk to dead people. It was too disturbing for production,"New York (CNN Business) The internet is buzzing over a new technology created by Microsoft developers that could make it possible to have a virtual conversation with a deceased loved one (well, kind of).

Microsoft MSFT patent granted tolast month details a method for creating a conversational chatbot modeled after a specific person — a ""past or present entity ... such as a friend, a relative, an acquaintance, a celebrity, a fictional character, a historical figure,"" according to the filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office.

The technology is reminiscent of a fictional app in the dystopian TV series ""Black Mirror"" that allowed a character to continue chatting with her boyfriend after he dies in an accident, by pulling information from his social media.

Want to talk music with David Bowie? Or get some words of wisdom from your late grandmother? This tool would theoretically make that possible. But don't get too excited, or freaked out for that matter: The company isn't planning to turn the technology into an actual product.

Dethroned Italian prince criticized over Holocaust Remembrance Day apology,"(CNN) A letter from a descendent of Italy's wartime King, apologizing for his ancestor's role in enabling Mussolini's fascist policies during World War II, has been criticized by historians and Jewish groups after several decades of silence from members of the disbanded royal family.

Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, the great-grandson of King Victor Emmanuel III, wrote a letter to the country's Jewish community in which he said his family's role in rubber-stamping dictator Benito Mussolini's anti-Semitic laws caused ""a wound still open for the whole of Italy.""

He said he and his relatives ""dissociate ourselves firmly"" from the King, who approved Mussolini's rise to power and gave the laws royal assent, and asked for forgiveness for his ancestor's actions.

But the gesture, made ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day on Wednesday, has been dismissed by historians as ""too little too late,"" and has drawn the ire of Jewish groups who condemned the family's lengthy reluctance to confront its role in laying the groundwork for the Holocaust in Europe.

Mussolini's race laws tore away at the civil rights of Jewish Italians between 1938 and 1943, during which time the dictator allied himself to Hitler to form the Axis powers.

Regeneron says study shows its monoclonal antibody cocktail works against coronavirus variants,"(CNN) Tests on two different variants of the coronavirus show that one of the two monoclonal antibodies in Regeneron's cocktail therapy can neutralize both, despite the mutations, researchers reported Wednesday.

The tests also confirm what other teams of researchers have found: vaccines are likely to protect people against both the variant first seen in Britain and known as B.1.1.7, and one first noted in South Africa and called B.1.135. However, the mutations in B.1.135 do allow the virus to evade immune responses a little more, the team, led by Dr. David Ho at Columbia University's Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, reported in a pre-print report -- one not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Regeneron's cocktail has been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration, and it was used to treat former president Donald Trump when he was infected with coronavirus last year.

""As we expected, the virus continues to mutate, and these data show the continued ability of REGEN-COV to neutralize emerging strains, further validating our multi-antibody cocktail approach to infectious diseases,"" Regeneron president Dr. George Yancopoulos said in a statement.

""With two complementary antibodies in one therapeutic, even if one has reduced potency, the risk of the cocktail losing efficacy is significantly diminished, since the virus would need to mutate in multiple distinct locations to evade both antibodies.""

Ho's team tested convalescent plasma from 20 patients who recovered from Covid-19 , and also blood from 22 people who got two doses of either Pfizer's or Moderna's coronavirus vaccines. They also tested Eli Lilly and Company's single monoclonal antibody treatment, which also has an EUA.

The mutations in B.1.1.7 had small effects, if any. But one mutation especially, in B.1.135, did reduce the efficacy of the immune response in convalescent plasma, in both vaccines, of one of Regeneron's antibodies and of Lilly's antibody, they said.

The same mutation is found in a variant first seen in Brazil.

""Mutationally, this virus is traveling in a direction that could ultimately lead to escape from our current therapeutic and prophylactic interventions directed to the viral spike,"" Ho's team wrote.

""If the rampant spread of the virus continues and more critical mutations accumulate, then we may be condemned to chasing after the evolving SARS-CoV-2 continually, as we have long done for influenza virus.""

This means the world must vaccinate people faster and, in the meantime, double down on measures to stop the spread of virus, such as mask use, they said."
Biden aims for comprehensive climate approach as he halts new oil and gas leases on federal land,"(CNN) President Joe Biden signed several executive actions related to the climate crisis on Wednesday, including one directing the secretary of the interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters.

Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a ""whole of government"" approach to climate change. They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorized people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice.

""Today is climate day at the White House and, which means that today is jobs day at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor,"" Biden said at the outset of his remarks at a signing ceremony. ""We're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water cleaner air and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security.""

He continued: ""It's a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer.""

The executive order on oil and natural gas leases directs the interior secretary to launch a ""rigorous review"" of the existing leasing and permitting programs related to fossil fuel development, and to identify steps to double renewable energy production from offshore wind by 2030, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.

The halting of new leases fulfills a campaign promise by Biden and will expand an existing 60-day moratorium issued by the President on his first day in office. Biden's climate actions mark a sharp departure from the Trump administration's efforts to maximize fossil fuel production and expand oil and gas drilling on federal lands but climate emissaries for the administration emphasized they hope to build new job opportunities out of the changes.

During the signing ceremony, Biden said his administration is ""not going to ban fracking -- we'll protect jobs and grow jobs, including through stronger standards like controls for methane leaks and union workers willing to install the changes.""

On the campaign trail, Biden explicitly opposed a nationwide ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking . He also said he supports using fracking to open underground natural gas formations to "" transition "" to cleaner kinds of energy.

White House climate czar Gina McCarthy described the order as one that ""directs everyone who works for the President to use every tool available at our disposal to solve the climate crisis. Because we're going to take a whole of government approach.""

""We're going to power our economy with clean energy,"" McCarthy added. ""We're going to do that in a way that will produce millions of American jobs that are going to be good-paying, that are going to be jobs that have the opportunity for workers to join a union because, as President Biden has often told us, when he thinks of climate change, his first thought is about jobs.""

John Kerry, the new presidential envoy for climate, discussed how workers in the fossil fuel and coal industries who may face health risks on the job have the opportunity to transition to less risky alternative energy jobs. He said they ""have been fed a false narrative"" that ""somehow dealing with climate is coming at their expense. No. It's not. What's happening to them is happening because of other market forces.""

Kerry told the press that Biden is issuing the actions because the US needs to address climate change on a global scale.

""(Biden) knows that (the Paris climate agreement) alone is not enough,"" Kerry said in the briefing room. ""Not when almost 90% of all of the planet's emissions global emissions come from outside of US borders. We could go to zero tomorrow, and the problem isn't solved. So that's why today, one week into the job, President Biden will sign this additional executive set of orders to help move us down the road, ensuring that ambitious climate action is global in scope and scale as well as national, here at home.""

Biden on Wednesday also established the climate crisis as an ""essential element of US foreign policy and national security."" The order instructs the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, to prepare a national intelligence estimate on the security implications of the climate crisis and directs all agencies to develop strategies for integrating climate considerations into their international work.

Biden also reestablished the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and form the National Climate Task Force, which will be composed of leaders across 21 federal agencies and departments.

Biden will host a Leaders' Climate Summit on Earth Day, April 22, and the US will reconvene the Major Economies Forum. McCarthy said the US would announce its so-called Nationally Determined Contribution -- required in the Paris Climate Accord that Biden rejoined -- before the summit of leaders scheduled for Earth Day.

The executive order officially creates the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, which will be led by McCarthy, who formerly led the Environmental Protection Agency. It also creates a White House environmental justice interagency council and a White House environmental justice advisory council to prioritize environmental justice.

Biden will also take action on protecting 30% of the country's land and water by 2030. A 2018 study by the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy organization based in Washington, found that only 12% of the country's land has been conserved, including as national parks and national wildlife refuges.

The President will establish a Civilian Climate Corps Initiative to put Americans to work with jobs that include restoring public lands and waters, increasing reforestation and protecting biodiversity.

He also set up an interagency working group on coal and coal and power plant communities and economic revitalization, which will by co-chaired by McCarthy and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, and will direct federal agencies to assist coal, oil and natural gas, and power plant communities.

Biden has taken a series of steps aimed at reprioritizing environmental climate issues. He halted more than 100 regulatory actions on the environment taken by the Trump administration, announced the US would rejoin the Paris climate agreement and canceled the Keystone XL pipeline.

The President has sought to highlight how his administration will take science more seriously than the past administration did. In addition to appointing McCarthy as the White House climate czar, Biden has named former secretary of state Kerry as a presidential envoy for climate, which is a Cabinet-level position that also has a position on the National Security Council.

The Biden administration has told reporters to expect more briefings by scientists and public health experts, not political appointees and the President, to explain the ongoing efforts to combat Covid-19.

"NASA astronauts Victor Glover, Mike Hopkins conduct spacewalk Wednesday","(CNN) Astronauts Mike Hopkins and Victor Glover Jr. conducted a spacewalk Wednesday to upgrade and maintain the International Space Station.

It was the first spacewalk experience for Glover, who is a few months into his first spaceflight on the station.

""What a beautiful view,"" Glover said after he began the spacewalk.

This was the third spacewalk for Hopkins, who previously completed two spacewalks during his first six-month venture to the space station from September 25, 2013, to March 10, 2014.

The spacewalk officially began at 6:28 a.m. ET and ended at 1:24 p.m. ET. It lasted for about six hours and 56 minutes.

A CNN analysis of data from 14 states found vaccine coverage is on average twice as high among White people as it is among Black and Latino people.

The figures are even more concerning because Black and Latino Americans are already dying of Covid-19 at three times the rate of White people and being hospitalized at a rate four times higher, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

So far, nearly 20 million people -- about 6% of the US population -- have received at least the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. Nearly 3.5 million are fully vaccinated. The numbers are a far cry from where some officials hoped the United States would be by now.

Yesterday, President Joe Biden announced measures aimed at ramping up vaccine allocation and distribution , including the purchase of 200 million more doses and increased distribution to states by millions of shots from next week.

With those extra doses, Biden said 300 million Americans -- nearly the entire US population -- could be inoculated by the end of summer or early fall. Biden's plan includes putting federally supported vaccination centers in high-risk neighborhoods, setting up mobile vaccination sites in medically underserved areas, administering the vaccine at independent pharmacies and partnering with community health centers. It will also ensure high-risk facilities such as jails and homeless shelters have access to the vaccine.

""We are going to make sure there are vaccination centers in communities hit hardest by the pandemic, in Black and Latino communities and rural communities as well,"" Biden said.

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.

Q: I've had my vaccine now. Can I ditch the face mask?

A: Please don't. CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University, explains why: ""The vaccine will protect you from getting ill and then ending up hospitalized, but it's possible that you could still carry the virus and be contagious to others. So those who get the vaccine should still be wearing masks and practicing physical distancing.""

Wen said this doesn't mean we will need to wear masks forever. It is estimated that about 70% of the population must be vaccinated before we reach herd immunity. That's the point where enough people have immunity that the virus won't spread any more.

AstraZeneca pushes back amid an ugly row over vaccines

AstraZeneca's chief executive Pascal Soriot has rejected criticism from top European officials over delays in vaccine deliveries to the bloc. Speaking to the Italian newspaper la Repubblica yesterday, Soriot said that because the European Union's vaccine orders came after those from some other countries, the drugmaker was unable to give the bloc an iron-clad commitment on its delivery schedule.

The EU said AstraZeneca surprisingly announced last week it would deliver fewer than expected doses to the bloc. EU officials responded by threatening to restrict vaccine exports. Italy has warned that it could take legal action. The ugly row over vaccine supplies puts question marks over the EU's previous -- and loud -- declarations of solidarity, cooperation and the need to ensure access to vaccines in developing countries.

The world is watching. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa even accused rich countries of hoarding vaccines, while Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of UNAIDS, called the situation ""vaccine apartheid."" And in their annual letter released today, Bill and Melinda Gates warned against ""immunity inequality."" They wrote: ""From the beginning of the pandemic, we have urged wealthy nations to remember that Covid‐19 anywhere is a threat everywhere. Until vaccines reach everyone, new clusters of disease will keep popping up.""

Covid-19 has killed 100,000 people in the UK. The government is still getting it wrong

The UK has the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths in the world, proportionate to population. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly pointed to a new and more contagious variant of the virus, now infamously known around the world as the ""UK variant,"" as one of the reasons.

But it's not that simple. Like in the first wave, the government has been slow to respond to rising case and death numbers with restrictions. It has failed to get an adequate contact-tracing and isolation system running. And it has, again, been slow on border controls, only closing ""travel corridors"" with more than 60 countries or territories in mid-January amid record-breaking daily death tolls. Experts say the government hasn't learned from its past mistakes and still lacks a coherent strategy, Angela Dewan writes

Student suicides pushed a school district to speed up a return to in-person learning

As Covid-19 cases climb across the US, school districts are facing an impossible dilemma of protecting either students' mental health by returning to the classroom or their physical health by keeping them at home. Nevada's Clark County School District, the fifth-largest in the US, is expediting its plan to bring students back after a rise in student suicides . Meanwhile, major districts in Chicago and New Jersey have shelved plans to return to the physical classroom at the last minute in the face of opposition from teachers.

A new study from the US CDC says in-person learning is possible -- but only with the right precautions. The Biden administration said it wants schools to reopen but believes Congress must make the necessary investments to safely return to in-person learning.

"Lawmakers in 14 states have proposed anti-LGBTQ bills, many of which target trans youth","(CNN) As is custom at the beginning of the legislative session, state lawmakers across the country have proposed a torrent of bills intended to boost local economies, constrain or expand spending or make much-needed infrastructure fixes.

But mixed in among the standard bureaucratic business are bills that take aim at LGBTQ+ residents of states -- bills that attempt to limit or dismantle their protections.

Just weeks into 2021, lawmakers in at least 14 states have proposed a slew of bills that would restrict the freedoms of LGBTQ residents. Most of the bills would affect transgender young people, according to Freedom For All Americans , the LGBTQ advocacy group that tracks the proposals.

NBC News was the first to report about the spate of anti-LGBTQ bills.

In Alabama , lawmakers proposed a bill that would ban physicians from prescribing medication to trans children that would affirm their gender. In Oklahoma , a proposed bill would lift a ban on conversion therapy and other practices that aim to suppress a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity. And in Montana, lawmakers in the state House have already passed bills that restrict trans minors' access to health care and even school sports

Most of the bills won't ever pass. But even introducing the legislation is damaging to LGBTQ people, especially youths, said Christy Mallory, legal director of UCLA Law's Williams Institute, a research center that centers on gender identity and sexual orientation law.

""Even just the campaigns around the bills can be really stigmatizing and hurt kids, even if the bills don't ultimately pass,"" she said. ""Just the fact that knowing that lawmakers are introducing these bills, people are seeing it and reading it, can signal to kids that maybe they're not supported by their states, that their government is not behind them.""

Transgender young people in particular are already at a higher risk of physical and sexual violence and suicidal thoughts than their cisgender peers, according to the Trevor Project , a suicide prevention resource for LGBTQ youth. In this way, limiting trans young people's rights by law and erasing their gender identities can be incredibly harmful, Mallory said.

A growing trend of discriminatory bills

There's been a troubling trend of bills aimed at limiting LGBTQ rights since the mid-2010s, a ""discriminatory response to the successful (same-sex) marriage litigation,"" said Jenny Pizer, law and policy director of Lambda Legal, a national legal organization that works to advance the civil rights of LGBTQ people.

Lawmakers started to specifically target young trans people since 2016, when North Carolina passed its infamous ""bathroom bill,"" which restricted transgender people from using the restroom that corresponded with their gender identity in government-run buildings. That bill was repealed in 2017 , though activists at the time said the political compromise still allowed some discrimination against trans North Carolinians to persist, Mallory said.

Even though the bill was later repealed, North Carolina's bathroom bill inspired a slew of ""copycat bills"" that took aim at transgender people's access to bathrooms, school sports and, critically, gender-affirming health care, Mallory said.

Though the North Carolina bill passed before the 2016 presidential election, some lawmakers who've introduced similar bills since have likely been influenced by the Trump administration's often ""hostile"" policies toward LGBTQ and trans Americans, Mallory said, like the former President's transgender military ban or his attempts to roll back protections against discrimination in health care.

It's possible that some lawmakers are proposing new anti-LGBTQ laws as a response to the new Biden administration, Pizer said, which already lifted the trans military ban and enacted an executive order expanding protections for transgender people on Inauguration Day

""We need to anticipate that some of those who prioritize creating licenses to discriminate against us will return their attention to states they perceive as welcoming their anti-LGBTQ agenda,"" Pizer said.

The bills that activists fear the most

Of the bills proposed so far, Freedom For All Americans is most concerned about two proposals in Montana -- one that bans trans students from playing a school sport and another that would ban trans kids from receiving gender-affirming health care. Both bills have passed in the Montana House and will soon reach the state Senate, said Angela Dallara of Freedom for All Americans.

States where anti-LGBTQ bills have been proposed, 2021 Alabama Indiana Iowa Kentucky Mississippi Missouri Montana New Hampshire North Dakota South Carolina Tennessee Texas Virginia Utah source: Freedom For All Americans

Montana Rep. John Fuller, who sponsored both bills, said the measures are necessary because ""every child deserves a natural childhood, one that allows them to experience puberty and other normal changes that shape who they will become,"" according to the Montana Free Press

If the state does pass the bills, it won't be done quietly. Several trans and non-binary Montana residents testified online and in person this month about the harm the school sports bill would cause young trans people in the state despite supporters of the bill continuing to use offensive language and misgender trans people, the SB Nation blog Outsports reported

Much of the reason similar bills don't pass is because of the overwhelming opposition to them, Mallory said, funded by civil rights organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and led by local activists. Lawmakers in many of the same states where discriminatory bills have been proposed have introduced bills of their own that bolster nondiscrimination laws and better protect trans and LGBTQ people, Freedom For All Americans' legislative tracker shows"
Anxiety robbing your sleep? A weighted blanket may help,"(CNN) After my sister gave me a weighted blanket for Christmas, it became the gift that I didn't know I needed. It's one of the best things ever to happen to me.

As someone with anxiety, I've struggled with restful sleep: Falling asleep can take up to two hours, or I wake up at least twice during the night.

The first night I started sleeping underneath a 15-pound weighted blanket, I slept straight through the night for the first time in months and felt more rested during the day. After a few days of good sleep, I learned that my sister had done her gift research — she had read that people with anxiety tended to feel more grounded when using the blankets.

Fascinated, I asked experts on mental health and sleep to explain why these heavy blankets — which are filled with plastic, glass or metal particles and layered with extra fabric — have eased the, ahem, weight of some people's anxiety-related sleep struggles.

Weighted blankets, which range from 5 to 30 pounds (2.27 to 13.6 kilograms), have been used by special needs educators and occupational therapists since the late 1990s , but have become mainstream in the last few years. Regular blankets can weigh around 3 to 5 pounds.

The dominant theory is that weighted blankets provide deep pressure stimulation, a feeling that resembles a ""firm, but gentle, squeeze or holding sensation and ... triggers these feelings of relaxation and of being calm,"" said pulmonary and sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. Feeling relaxed is what decreases cortisol, a stress hormone that typically runs high in people with chronic anxiety, stress and other disorders, he added.

There is evidence suggesting that deep pressure stimulation reduces sympathetic nervous system arousal — that's our fight-or-flight response — and increases parasympathetic activity, which may cause the calming effect, said Dr. Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, the director of sleep medicine at Millennium Physician Group in Florida.

Pressure to stimulate the sensation of touch to muscles and joints is the same proposed mechanism behind massage and acupressure, added Abbasi-Feinberg, who is also a neurologist on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine's board of directors. ""This calming (effect) can promote better quality sleep.""

If you're interested in using a weighted blanket to aid sleep problems related to mental or sensory disorders, here's what you should know about their effectiveness, any caveats and how to choose one.

What we do and don't know

Weighted blankets have been growing in popularity, but there isn't actually much research on their effectiveness. That may be due to the newness of weighted blankets, their relative harmlessness and that other health issues are more urgent for researchers to study, Dasgupta said.

Some people with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or insomnia have reported improved quality of sleep and feeling more restful during the day, a few recent, small studies have found. Many study participants experienced a decrease of 50% or more in their Insomnia Severity Index scores after using a weighted blanket for four weeks, in comparison to 5.4% of the control group, according to a small study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine last September.

In the follow-up phase of the study, which lasted one year, people who used weighted blankets continued to benefit. People who switched from lightweight control blankets to weighted blankets experienced similar effects. And those who used weighted blankets also reported better sleep maintenance, a higher daytime activity level, remission from insomnia symptoms and alleviated symptoms of anxiety, depression and fatigue.

Researchers who studied the effects of weighted blankets on children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or autism have found either some positive associations or no associations with better sleep or reduced symptoms.

""A 'grounded feeling' due to the use of weighted blankets may be attributed to the psychoanalytic 'holding environment' theory, which states that touch is a basic need that provides calming and comfort,"" Abbasi-Feinberg said via email. ""Weighted blankets are designed to work similar to the way tight swaddling helps newborns feel snug and secure.""

Many, if not all, of the available studies on weighted blankets used participants who had a psychiatric, developmental or sleep disorder such as anxiety, depression, autism, ADHD or insomnia. That's likely because of ""the fact that these segments of the population are the ones who could benefit most from touch- or sensory-related therapies,"" Abbasi-Feinberg said.

However, given how weighted blankets might work to reduce cortisol levels, they could help to reduce general stress, too, Dasgupta said.

Who can use them

People have shared their fondness for weighted blankets in studies and online, but people with the same psychiatric disorders may not have the same relaxing experiences with weighted blankets. One person in the follow-up phase of the 2020 study discontinued their participation due to feelings of anxiety when using the blanket. People who are claustrophobic may also not fare well. More studies on factors that make individuals more or less helped by weighted blankets are needed, Dasgupta added.

Weighted blankets have become somewhat mainstream as some people feel that the blankets improve sleep quality.

A weighted blanket's calming abilities may help to regulate breathing, but some health professionals are hesitant to recommend weighted blankets to people with obstructive sleep apnea, asthma or other respiratory conditions. ""You'd have to be pretty brittle and pretty sick if a blanket's going to stop your breathing,"" Dasgupta said. But if you're not sure, he added, be careful and talk to your pulmonologist first.

Children should be assessed by occupational therapists or pediatricians before they try weighted blankets, as many weighted blankets haven't been tested for the effectiveness and safety for children.

""Weighted blankets shouldn't be used for toddlers under 2 years old, as it may increase the risk of suffocation,"" Abbasi-Feinberg said. ""It's important for parents to always consult their pediatrician before trying a weighted blanket.""

Dogs sometimes benefit from pressure-applying garments during storms or other anxiety-inducing events, but weighted blankets can be dangerous for pets, said Dr. Douglas Kratt, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.

""For smaller or elderly dogs, weighted blankets may be too heavy, restricting your pet's movement in potentially dangerous ways,"" he added. ""If your pet is a chewer, the contents of these blankets could also pose a choking risk or, if ingested, cause a gastrointestinal obstruction.""

Discuss possible behavior modification plans with your veterinarian first.

What to know when looking for a weighted blanket

If you're looking for a weighted blanket, there are multiple options in terms of weight, materials and size. A blanket that weighs 7% to 12% of your body weight is typically the range to choose from, but that may depend on personal preference. ""Some individuals might want a heavier weight to feel a sense of 'hugging' and calmness, while others might want something lighter,"" Abbasi-Feinberg said.

And there are weighted blankets for year-round use, she added — some are made with a higher proportion of fabric layers made from cotton, which is lighter than other materials and allows air to pass through its fibers, therefore better managing your body temperature.

Dasgupta thinks of sleep as a puzzle, and sometimes people with insomnia or mental disorders are missing some of the pieces needed for great sleep, but ""no one really knows what puzzle pieces are missing.""

Weighted blankets could help, but they're not a cure-all — a healthy sleep routine is still necessary for getting enough of both sleep time and the deeper stages that leave you refreshed. If you think that a weighted blanket could be your missing puzzle piece, ""it's worth a try,"" Dasgupta said. The downside is that these blankets can be pricey.

During the pandemic, ""sleep really took a hit"" when it comes to insomnia, altered circadian rhythm and nightmares, Dasgupta said. ""A weighted blanket is something that might have a role during this pandemic. ... That sense of the basic need to be touched and hugged could actually provide some comfort and security. Maybe that's why some people benefit from a weighted blanket."""
Rand Paul calls impeachment 'dead on arrival' after most Republicans signal that trial is unconstitutional,"Washington (CNN) The Senate tabled an effort by Sen. Rand Paul Tuesday to force a vote on the constitutionality of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, but the vote offered an indicator for how Republican senators -- who overwhelmingly voted for Paul's measure -- feel about the trial.

Paul's motion was killed on a 55-45 vote, with five Republicans joining all Democrats, meaning 45 Republicans voted for Paul's effort. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania crossed party lines to vote with Democrats.

In order to convict Trump at his trial, at least 17 Republicans will need to vote with all Democrats when the trial begins next month. Significantly, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell sided with Paul in the vote -- a potential indicator that he agrees the constitutionality of impeaching a former President is in question.

Paul argued after the vote that the fact that 45 Republicans sided with him ""shows that impeachment is dead on arrival.""

""If you voted that it was unconstitutional then how in the world would you ever hope to convict somebody for this?"" Paul asked, adding ,""45 of us, almost the entire caucus, 95% of the caucus, voted that the whole proceeding was unconstitutional. This is a big victory for us. Democrats can beat this partisan horse as long as they want -- this vote indicates it's over, the trial is all over.""

"FDA places all alcohol-based hand sanitizers from Mexico on ""import alert""","The US Food and Drug Administration has placed all alcohol-based hand sanitizers coming from Mexico on a nationwide ""import alert"" until the agency is able to review the products’ safety.

""Over the course of the ongoing pandemic, the agency has seen a sharp increase in hand sanitizer products from Mexico that were labeled to contain ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol) but tested positive for methanol contamination,"" the FDA said in a news release on Tuesday.

According to the FDA, methanol, or wood alcohol, is a substance that can be toxic when absorbed through the skin and can be life-threatening if ingested. This substance is not an acceptable ingredient in hand sanitizer or other any drugs in the United States.

""Consumer use of hand sanitizers has increased significantly during the coronavirus pandemic, especially when soap and water are not accessible, and the availability of poor-quality products with dangerous and unacceptable ingredients will not be tolerated,"" said Judy McMeekin, FDA Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs.

From April through December 2020, the FDA found that 84% of the samples that were analyzed were not in compliance with the FDA’s regulations.

More than half of the samples were found to contain toxic ingredients, including methanol and/or 1-propanol, at dangerous levels.

This is the first time the FDA has implemented a countrywide import alert for any drug product. Under this import alert, alcohol-based hand sanitizers from Mexico will be subject to heightened scrutiny, and the FDA may detain the shipments."
Yulia Navalnaya's husband was poisoned and detained. Now she is piling pressure on Vladimir Putin,"Moscow (CNN) ""Why are you detaining me? Have I violated any laws?"" demanded Yulia Navalnaya , as four policemen surrounded her on Saturday. She was on her way to a protest in Moscow, where thousands had gathered to demand the release of her husband, Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, from jail .

She was freed a few hours later, once riot police had dispersed the crowds. Nevertheless, the promptness with which Moscow police tracked her down and detained her speaks to the fears she and her husband spark in the Kremlin, as protests rage across Russia.

While Alexey Navalny rose to prominence first as a blogger, then as a politician, Navalnaya, 44, chose for herself a life largely outside the spotlight. She followed him to several protests and supported Alexey during his mayoral and presidential campaigns, but made few speeches or public appearances.

But in late August, her husband was poisoned with nerve agent Novichok. As he lay comatose in a clinic in Omsk, Navalnaya suddenly stepped into the center stage of a battle with the Russian state -- and her image of a stoic, calm, and collected woman became a story in its own.

Russian independent media have since compared her to former US First Lady Michelle Obama, and supporters now wonder if she might lead the country's opposition movement one day.

Navalnaya moved quickly to put public and international pressure on the Russian government after her husband was poisoned -- and in doing so may have saved his life.

She held impromptu press conferences on the clinic's doorstep telling journalists she believed her husband remained in grave danger while in Russia. Local doctors were refusing to let him be medically evacuated to Germany, likely due to pressure from Russia's secret service, Navalnaya alleged.

""This is being done so that the traces of the chemical substance disappear from Alexey's system,"" she said, masking any emotion with black sunglasses. ""He is not in a very good condition, we can't trust this hospital, and we demand that he is given back to us.""

Yulia Navalnaya (right), at least in public, has often laughed off the hardships that her husband (left) has brought on the family through his battle with the Russian state.

To further pressure the Kremlin, Navalnaya even went to the man her husband believes was behind the attack, the Russian President himself. She wrote directly to Vladimir Putin demanding that he allow her husband to leave the country.

Putin later said that he ""immediately gave the order"" to let Navalny go when he received Navalnaya's letter. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any involvement in the poisoning.

She and the comatose Navalny were soon flown to Berlin, along with some evidence gathered from his hotel room that would later be crucial in helping European labs identify Novichok, a military grade chemical weapon first developed by the Soviet Union.

""Yulia, you saved me,"" Navalny wrote on Instagram, shortly after he regained consciousness at Berlin's Charite Hospital, crediting her for his remarkable recovery.

In the spotlight

The couple met shortly after Yulia, a Moscow native and the daughter of a scientist and an employee of the state consumer-goods ministry, graduated from Plekhanov University of Economics, where she studied international relations. She worked in a bank before leaving to care for their eldest daughter, Darya, who is now studying at Stanford University in the United States.

Returning from maternity leave, Navalnaya helped her parents-in-law sell furniture for a few years, but after her and Navalny's son, Zakhar, was born -- and with Navalny increasingly in the spotlight -- she decided to focus solely on the family.

Before Navalny's near-fatal poisoning, Navalnaya's most famous public appearance dated back to 2013, when she spoke out to support his run for Moscow mayor.

""In Russia ... we don't see the politicians' wives at protests, but politics storms into families' lives whether you like it or not,"" Navalnaya said from the stage where at a concert in her husband's support, she described how members of her family had frequently found themselves the target of law enforcement due to Alexey's activism.

In the over seven years since, politics has indeed caused her family a fair share of trouble. In 2014, Navalny was on the brink of getting a three and a half year-long prison sentence in an embezzlement case he believes was fabricated to bar him from running for public offices again. His brother Oleg was imprisoned, while Alexey got away with a suspended sentence following a court decision many viewed as a way for the authorities to avoid fueling public support for the Kremlin critic.

Navalny has spent weeks on end in detention centers after anti-government demonstrations and been physically attacked by radical groups. In 2017 Navalny was splashed in the face with an antiseptic green dye that damaged vision in one of his eyes.

Their family has also been under constant surveillance for years. According to a CNN-Bellingcat investigation , phone and travel records suggest members of a Russian intelligence team followed Navalny to at least 17 cities since 2017.

Yulia Navalnaya appealed directly to President Putin to allow her husband to be flown to Germany for treatment.

Navalnaya herself may have been poisoned while on a family vacation in Kaliningrad last year. Flight manifests obtained by the investigation show at least three members of FSB flew to the city at the same time, and security cameras at the hotel were turned off for the duration of their stay, a source told Bellingcat.

On July 6, hours after the FSB team returned to Moscow, she fell ill, experiencing what Navalny would later describe as sudden exhaustion and disorientation.

Yulia recovered, and the exact cause of her illness was not determined. But experts have told CNN that such symptoms are consistent with a low dosage of poisoning, and looking back, Navalny believes the symptoms were ""absolutely the same"" as those he would experience while recovering from his encounter with Novichok.

'The First Lady'

Alexey Navalny regained consciousness at Berlin's Charite Hospital in September and credited Yulia for his remarkable recovery

Navalnaya, at least in public, has often laughed off the hardships that her husband's battle with the state has brought on the family.

""Everyone always wants me to say or hint that yes, I'd like it [for Alexey to stop what he is doing]. No. I support what he does, I say that sincerely,"" she said in her first comprehensive on-camera interview, with the prominent Russian blogger and filmmaker Yury Dud, filmed after Navalny's poisoning. ""Dropping everything half-way, that's just not cool.""

When their personal bank accounts were frozen last year as a result of an embezzlement case against Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, which he believes was also politically motivated, the family was forced to rely on cash for all purchases, she told Dud.

""I just learned that I'm a member of a criminal gang called 'Navalny's allies,' and all of our funds have been frozen,"" she wrote on Instagram at the time . ""I'm furious. Why is Alexey Navalny the leader of the gang? Maybe I'm the criminal boss here, and he is just a supporter of mine.""

Navalnaya's supporting role in her husband's political career stands in stark contrast to the spouses of most Russian and Soviet leaders. Putin's wife Lyudmila Putina was rarely seen in public and has faded into obscurity since they announced their divorce in 2013.

""Navalny never denies the exceptional role Yulia played in his life, and this is one of his strengths,"" Novaya Gazeta reporter Vera Chelishcheva wrote after the paper named her one of its heroes of the year for 2020.

""He is not hiding his wife, he openly confesses his love to her, but is not showing off, he posts her photos on Instagram, protects her and does not hide that she is the one who saves him in life.""

Just over a week ago, the couple flew back to Russia after spending five months amid the idyllic landscapes of the German countryside -- knowing full well that, once they landed back in Moscow, they ran the risk of being separated for years.

Before take-off, Yulia posted a humorous video on Instagram, repeating a line from a popular 90s Russian crime drama ""Brother"": ""Garçon, pour us some vodka, we are flying home.""

The video now became viral on TikTok among those calling for Navalny's release. He was detained shortly after arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, where their plane had been diverted at the last minute.

As police prepared to escort Navalny away, Navalnaya gave her husband a hug and a kiss and stepped into the cold outside the airport to address a crowd of journalists and supporters: ""[Alexey] is not afraid, I'm not afraid, and I urge you all not to be afraid either,"" she said before being driven away to chants of her name.

Navalny's daring return to Russia means he now risks spending years behind bars. As a result, many Russia watchers speculate that she could assume leadership of Russia's opposition, comparing her to Belarus' Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who ran for president in her husband Sergei's place, after the popular video-blogger and pro-democracy activist was jailed.

Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled over Belarus since 1994, was declared the winner of the disputed election, and Tikhanovskaya was forced to flee the country. Nevertheless, she remains the face of mass protests against the strongman leader.

Some Russian tabloids have speculated that Navalnaya could also run for a seat in Russia's parliament, the Duma, next fall. Similar rumors abounded before the Russian presidential elections in 2018, when Navalny was barred from running due to a past conviction.

Another presidential candidate, socialite Ksenia Sobchak recalled in an interview that she had suggested Yulia could run on his platform, but said that Navalny dismissed it, saying that ""votes are not transferrable.""

Navalnaya has so far voiced no aspirations for political office. But pro-Kremlin outlets have already slammed her as a ""project' by Western ""curators"" intent on meddling in Russian politics -- an echo of similar accusations against Navalny.

Her husband faces a court hearing next week that will determine their family's future for what may be years to come. Navalnaya remains defiant, thanking supporters -- who dubbed her ""the First Lady"" on Instagram -- for risking arrest last weekend to protest for his release."
The Soviet flying beast that never really took off,"(CNN) — The only surviving prototype of this unusual plane now sits dilapidated in a field near Moscow, but it was once the hope of the Soviet Union against US submarine attacks.

The Bartini Beriev VVA-14 -- the letters are an acronym for ""vertical take-off amphibious aircraft"" and 14 was the number of engines -- was designed to take off from anywhere without a runway and to be capable of sustained flight just above the water surface.

Designed in the 1960s, the aircraft was a response to the Polaris ballistic missiles. The United States introduced them in 1961 on its submarine fleet as part of its nuclear deterrent. In the mind of its designer, Robert Bartini, the amphibious VVA-14 would be the perfect machine to seek and destroy the missile-carrying submarines.

The plan, however, didn't pan out. Only two of the proposed three prototypes were ever built, and only one was ever flown. When Bartini died, in 1974, the project died with him, and the second prototype was dismantled.

The first, mostly intact, was sent in 1987 to the Central Air Force Museum near Moscow, but something went wrong with the delivery. The aircraft was looted and damaged, and it hasn't been repaired since.

""The VVA-14 was a flying boat that was supposed to take off from water or land vertically, and then fly like a regular plane at altitude,"" says Andrii Sovenko, a Soviet aviation historian. In 2005, Sovenko met Nikolai Pogorelov, the deputy of Robert Bartini during the design phase of the plane.

""According to Pogorelov, Bartini was a visionary who had an unusual mind and character. It seemed that he was not from his time, but from some other era -- someone even called him an alien. Without a doubt, Bartini has left a mark in Soviet aircraft building. However, he became famous mainly for his ideas and concepts, and only a few of those actually became reality,"" says Sovenko.

Bartini, who left his home in Italy for the Soviet Union in 1923 after the rise of the Fascists, had envisaged several different versions of the VVA-14, including one with inflatable pontoons to land on water and another with folding wings that could be operated from ships at sea.

The first prototype took to the air in 1972. It was later fitted with the pontoons and tested afloat.

""This aircraft did not have lifting engines or any equipment for searching for submarines. It was intended only for studying the characteristics of horizontal flight and testing the aircraft systems. In total, from 1972 to 1975, it performed 107 flights with over 103 flight hours,"" says Sovenko.

The odd looks earned it the nickname Zmei Gorynich, after a dragon from Russian folk tales. ""When looking at it from the ground, the VVA-14 caused understandable associations with Zmei Gorynych: she also had, as it were, three heads, as well as relatively small wings,"" said Sovenko.

A short second life

The second prototype was supposed to receive the engines for vertical take off, but they were never fitted to the almost completed plane, because a suitable engine type was never developed. This doomed the project, and the aircraft was disassembled.

Bartini tried to pump new life into the VVA-14 by turning into an ekranoplan, a type of aircraft that uses ground effect to glide close to a surface like water at high speed like a hovercraft does. The resulting tests, performed just after Bartini's death, informed the development of other such aircraft, making the USSR the undisputed leader in the field.

Despite this coda, however, the project was out of steam.

""I think the Soviet military very quickly realized that the effectiveness of the VVA-14 as an anti-submarine aircraft would have been low. It could only carry a very small number of missiles and the technical challenges of creating such an unusual vehicle were very large. Ultimately, the military relied on more conventional aircraft for the job,"" says Sovenko.

After it was retired, the original prototype was transferred by barge from Taganrog in southern Russia, where it had been built and tested, to a small town near Moscow, Lytkarino. Unloaded ashore, it was left unattended and partially destroyed and dismantled.

Later transported via helicopter to nearby Monino at the Central Air Force Museum, the aircraft remains badly damaged to this day.

""Indeed, some fragments of the original prototype have been in Monino for 33 years, in the form of scrap metal. Why the museum administration will not take measures to restore this very interesting aircraft, I don't know,"" says Sovenko.

Missing parts

Russia's Central Air Force Museum says the cost of restoring the aircraft would be about $1.2 million Courtesy Andrii Salnikov

The Central Air Force Museum is mostly open air, so much like the other aircraft in its collection -- the largest in the world for Soviet planes -- the VVA-14 has been sitting outdoors. Tucked away in a peripheral area of the exhibit, it's conspicuously missing its wings.

Parts of them and of the airframe appear to be lying next to it, as can be seen on Google Maps

Alexander Zarubetsky, the museum's director, confirmed to CNN Travel that several components of the plane are missing.

""In 2012, representatives from the Taganrog aircraft plant, where the VVA-14 was built, promised to help in the search for spare parts for the VVA-14, but the lack of funding did not allow these wishes to be realized,"" he says.

He adds that, if funding were to be secured, the cost of restoration would be around $1.2 million, and that it would take between one and two years if performed by aviation specialists directly at the museum.

If the VVA-14 had fully been completed and tested, Sovenko says, it would have been a truly unique aircraft.

""It could have taken off and landed both horizontally and vertically, and on both land and on water. It could have stayed afloat for a long time as a ship and conducted anti-submarine warfare. And of course, it could have flown like a regular plane too,"" he says."
EU and AstraZeneca fight over vaccine delays while death toll mounts,"London (CNN Business) A war of words between the European Union and AstraZeneca escalated on Wednesday as the two sides argued in public over coronavirus vaccine delays that threaten the bloc's fragile recovery from the pandemic .

The dispute began on Mondaywhen EU officials said they had been told bythat the company intended to supply ""considerably fewer"" doses in the coming weeks than had been agreed because of production problems.The European Commission has ordered 400 million doses on behalf of EU member states and is poised to start rolling them out across the bloc once the vaccine is approved, possibly this week.

""Pharmaceutical companies and vaccine developers have moral, societal and contractual responsibilities which they need to uphold,"" EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides told reporters on Wednesday. ""The view that the company is not obliged to deliver [vaccines] ... is neither correct nor acceptable.""

""We are in a pandemic. We lose people everyday. These are not numbers, they are not statistics, these are persons, with families, with friends and colleagues,"" she added.

Germany marked one year since the virus arrived on Wednesday, with the country showing no signs of reduced infections. Portugal reported a record number of daily deaths in the past 24 hours. Strict lockdowns are in force in countries around the bloc.

The harsh rebuke from the European Union came after AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the company had agreed to make its ""best effort"" to deliver the doses EU countries had ordered but was not contractually committed to a schedule. In a statement, AstraZeneca said it still intended to deliver tens of millions of doses to EU countries in February and March.

The ""head start"" also gave AstraZeneca's operation in the United Kingdom more time to resolve the kind of supply chain issues that are now affecting EU deliveries, the CEO said. Soriot told the Italian newspaper la Repubblica on Tuesday that AstraZeneca was not able to guarantee the timing of EU deliveries because countries such as the United Kingdom were quicker to finalize orders.The ""head start"" also gave AstraZeneca's operation in the United Kingdom more time to resolve the kind of supply chain issues that are now affecting EU deliveries, the CEO said.

""We've had also teething issues like this in the UK supply chain. But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So, with the UK, we have had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced. As for Europe, we are three months behind in fixing those glitches,"" he said.

Pfizer PFE EU officials have declined to specify the scale of the vaccine shortfall. But the shock development came as they were still trying to assess the impact ofslowing deliveries of the vaccine it developed with BioNTech last week while a manufacturing facility in Belgium was upgraded.

The twin delays produced a sharp backlash across the region, where governments are already under pressure over a slow vaccine rollout. The highly unusual public spat with AstraZeneca now threatens to sour relations between Brussels and one of its major vaccine suppliers.

EU officials are threatening to tighten controls on vaccine exports, and Italy has warned that it could take legal action. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen turned up the heat on Tuesday, saying the bloc ""means business.""

""Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines, to create a truly global common good. And now the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations,"" she said during a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum.

Teething issues

In his interview with La Repubblica and other major European newspapers, Soriot acknowledged that his company had experienced problems at one large manufacturing facility in Europe. He said the early phase of vaccine production is often ""complicated,"" and the company is ""basically two months behind"" where it wanted to be.

""Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume,"" said Soriot. ""We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small.""

He also outlined crucial differences in the agreements the company has with the United Kingdom and the European Union.

""The contract with the UK was signed first and the UK, of course, said 'you supply us first,' and this is fair enough,"" he said. Three months later, when the European Union wanted to be supplied ""more or less at the same time"" as the United Kingdom, AstraZeneca was not able to make that commitment.

""Our contract [with the European Union] is not a contractual commitment. It's a best effort. Basically we said we're going to try our best, but we can't guarantee we're going to succeed. In fact, getting there, we are a little bit delayed,"" he said.

The European Union acknowledged on Wednesday that it had signed a ""best effort"" agreement with AstraZeneca. But a senior EU official said the bloc had already paid part of a €336 million ($406 million) down payment with the aim of boosting production, and Kyriakides rejected the logic of ""first come, first served.""

""We signed an advanced purchase agreement for a product which at the time did not exist and which still today is not yet authorized. And we signed it precisely to ensure that the company builds the manufacturing capacity to produce the vaccine early, so that they can deliver a certain volume of doses the day that it is authorized,"" the European Union's top health official said.

The European Union also said that doses produced at AstraZeneca's plants in the United Kingdom should be used to fulfill its order, opening the door to a potential spat with London.

""There is also no hierarchy of the full production plants named in the advanced purchase agreement. Two are in the EU and two are located in the UK,"" said Kyriakides.

AstraZeneca said in its statement that it has built more than a dozen regional supply chains to produce its vaccine, collaborating with over 20 partners in more than 15 countries.

""Each supply chain was developed with input and investment from specific countries or international organizations based on the supply agreements, including our agreement with the European Commission,"" the company said.

""As each supply chain has been set up to meet the needs of a specific agreement, the vaccine produced from any supply chain is dedicated to the relevant countries or regions and makes use of local manufacturing wherever possible.""

Ho-Yin Mak, an associate professor of management science at Oxford Saïd Business School, said that production delays for the AstraZeneca vaccine are the result of an absence of slack in its supply chain.

""Part of this is inevitable... Production hiccups such as AstraZeneca's reported yield problems are not uncommon, especially when manufacturers try to ramp up output rates rapidly,"" he said.

Political firestorm

Sanofi SNY EU vaccine efforts received a boost on Wednesday when French drugmakersaid it would manufacture 125 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for distribution in the bloc, with deliveries starting in summer 2021.

But European governments are demanding answers over delays, pointing out that the success of their vaccination efforts is dependent on the private sector.

""On the one hand we can only welcome the result of science, and on the other hand they have a monopoly and we are totally dependent,"" Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said on Saturday. ""There may be production issues, but these uncertainties and announcements make it very difficult to organize the campaign.""

Kyriakides said on Monday that the bloc would now demand ""full transparency concerning the export of vaccines"" from the European Union.

""In the future, all companies producing vaccines against Covid-19 in the EU will have to provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries. Humanitarian deliveries are of course not affected by this,"" she said on Twitter.

German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that the controls were not about putting the ""EU first"" but about making sure Europe got its fair share.

""In my view it makes sense that we have an export limit, meaning that vaccines which leave the European Union have a license so that we know what is being produced, what is leaving Europe, where it is leaving so that there is a fair distribution,"" he told German broadcaster ZDF.

Soriot said he understood the frustration.

""Governments are under pressure. Everybody is getting kind of a bit, you know, aggravated or emotional about those things. But I understand because the Commission is managing the process for the whole of Europe,"" the CEO said.

""As soon as we can, we'll help the EU,"" he added.

One-dose strategy

Soriot also offered support for a strategy pioneered in the United Kingdom that could help speed the European Union's vaccine rollout.

In order to vaccinate more of its population quickly, the United Kingdom is giving the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccines to as many people as possible, before administering a second dose up to 12 weeks later.

""I think the UK one-dose strategy is absolutely the right way to go, at least for our vaccine,"" said Soriot, adding that the second dose is needed for long term protection.

There is no final clinical trial data on the efficacy of administering just one shot of the two-dose vaccines.

"Biden confronts Putin over several issues in first call, White House says","(CNN) President Joe Biden held his first call Tuesday with his Russian counterpart, according to the White House, confronting President Vladimir Putin over a range of issues from a recent massive cyberattack to the suspected poisoning of the country's leading opposition figure.

The call, which occurred midday, amounted to Biden's opening bid at diplomacy with one of his chief adversaries, whom he has met previously but not dealt with as an equal.

Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki said he entered the phone call with the intention of discussing the New START nuclear treaty, which the Biden administration hopes to extend; Russian aggression in Ukraine; the Solarwinds cyber hack, the extent of which is still being determined; reports Russia placed bounties on American troops serving in Afghanistan; Moscow's interference in US presidential elections; and the poisoning of Alexei Navalny

""His intention was also to make clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of our national interests in response to malign actions by Russia,"" Psaki said, noting the call had taken place during her briefing and that a more fulsome summary would come later.

The lengthy list of topics for Biden's first conversation with Putin illustrates the troubled state of affairs between Washington and Moscow that he inherited from the previous administration. Biden has accused his predecessor, President Donald Trump , of being too weak on Russia, accusing him of being ""Putin's puppy"" during one of their general election debates.

Biden continues push to put racial equity at the forefront,"(CNN) Nearly a week into his administration, President Joe Biden is focused on creating a path toward equity after inheriting a deeply divided nation.

""President Biden believes gender identity should not be a bar to military service and that America's strength is found in its diversity,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. ""America is stronger around the world when it is inclusive.""

On Tuesday, Biden signed a range of executive orders that could potentially help bridge the gap in homeownership between people of color and White people, strengthen the fight against bigotry faced by Asian Americans and ease the anxiety of families with incarcerated relatives.

""I firmly believe the nation is ready to change but government has to change as well. We need to make equity and justice part of what we do every day, today, tomorrow and every day,"" Biden said during his remarks before signing the orders on Tuesday afternoon.

While previous administrations have had ""an interest in advancing justice and equity,"" a senior administration official told reporters earlier on Tuesday that ""never before has there been this whole of government approach"" in which every agency has been mandated to advance equity and be held accountable for it.

America's long history of housing discrimination

The Biden administration intends to promote fair housing in a country where the cost of housing is continuously slipping out of reach for millions of people.

On Tuesday, Biden signed a memorandum directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development to take steps to promote equitable housing politics, according to a senior administration official.

Lisa Rice, president and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance , said every year about 4 million people face discrimination when they are trying to purchase or rent homes, or while getting home loans and insurance for their houses or apartments.

But discrimination is not centered on those transactions, Rice says. ""There are systems in place that drive and perpetuate discrimination.""

""We hoard resources in predominantly White communities. And then we starve predominantly Black communities of resources. We starve Native American and Latino communities of resources,"" Rice said.

America's long history of housing and mortgage market discrimination practices such as redlining, the biased housing practice that stopped banks from providing mortgages in low-income, largely minority neighborhoods, has impacted generations of Black and Hispanic households, according to research by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.

Researchers found that nearly two-thirds of the Black, Hispanic and Native American populations living in poverty reside in communities with poverty rates above 20% and are underrepresented in higher-income areas.

Among those who own homes, Black people lag behind White homeowners. In the third quarter of 2020, nearly 76% of White households owned their homes compared with 46.4% of Black households and nearly 51% of Hispanic households, according to US Census data.

The Covid-19 pandemic has also disproportionately hurt Black and Latino renters and homeowners, advocates and researchers say. When people lost their jobs due to the economic downturn forced by the pandemic, renters couldn't pay their rent and began living on the edge of eviction.

Last week, Biden signed an executive action to extend the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's federal moratorium that is protecting millions of struggling renters from eviction until at least the end of March . The CDC's order first went into effect in September and was previously extended until January 31.

Covid-19 brought 'two pandemics' for Asian Americans, advocates say

Since the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, racism and xenophobia against Asian Americans spread across the nation, from violent attacks to racist slurs or jokes.

Biden is taking a stand against discrimination against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community with an executive order on Tuesday acknowledging the harm and directing the Department of Health and Human Services to consider issuing Covid-19 guidance to advance language access and sensitivity toward these communities, according to a senior administration official.

""It does send a signal to the Asian American community that we have an administration that cares about the community and wants to protect the community,"" said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC, which advocates for the civil and human rights of Asian Americans.

Yang said rampant ignorance, misinformation and former President Donald Trump's rhetoric about Covid-19 led to anti-Asian sentiment.

""Unfortunately the pandemic was really two pandemics for the Asian American community,"" Yang said.

Trump, some GOP lawmakers and administration officials used terms like ""the Chinese virus"" or ""the Wuhan virus,"" even after the World Health Organization and the CDC provided the official terminology for the virus in February. The WHO has advised not to use geographic locations in naming diseases because it creates a stigma.

In response to the spike in incidents, Yang said his organization along with Hollaback!, an initiative aimed at combating harassment, have trained over 15,000 people in techniques to intervene and de-escalate if they witness an incident.

Biden will seek to address mass incarceration and one of his first steps will be ending the use of private prisons, according to a senior administration official. The Obama administration moved to phase out the use of private prisons in 2016 but the decision was reversed by the Trump administration.

According to a 2020 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, about 2.1 million adults were held in America's prisons and jails at the end of 2018. In federal prisons, Black people represent nearly 39% of all detainees, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons though they make up only about 13% of the US population.

Jail and prisons have struggled for years with crowded conditions and inadequate resources and they have not been spared by the coronavirus pandemic.

Some of the country's largest Covid-19 outbreaks have been reported in correctional facilities. The Covid-19 mortality rate in state and federal prisons has been twice as high as in the general population after adjusting for sex, age and the race/ethnicity of those in prisons, according to an analysis by Kevin T. Schnepel, an assistant professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia.

Groups are calling for a new White House racial equity office

JUST WATCHED Biden on race inequity: 'We have to break the cycle' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden on race inequity: 'We have to break the cycle' 01:54

A coalition of civil rights groups are urging Biden to create a White House office dedicated to leading federal efforts in advancing racial equality and confronting systemic racism in the country.

The NAACP, National Urban League, UnidosUS, Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum; and Faith in Action are some of the organizations that are part of the coalition.

In a memo sent in December, the coalition proposed the creation of an office that would be responsible for supporting federal agencies in their racial equity work, supporting the collection of racial data, fostering partnerships between federal agencies and civil society and training federal employees on racial equity.

""Even before 2020 exposed our pandemic of triple deadly disease and economic hardship and racial unrest, America was a nation that still had only begun to grapple with the legacy of White supremacy,"" said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. ""Establishing a White House Office on Racial Equity and Inclusion is our best hope of nurturing that awakening and achieving our true potential.""

Members of the coalition met with Biden's transition team on January 12 to discuss their vision for the office and conversations with the administration are ongoing, said Elana Needle, director of the Racial Equity Anchor Collaborative."
Beijing Olympics: The US has accused China of Xinjiang genocide. Will it now boycott the 2022 Games?,"(CNN) The United States' determination that China is committing genocide in Xinjiang presents a rare moral predicament for athletes and countries preparing to compete in the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

Outgoing US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the announcement on the last day of the Trump administration, drawing attention to the systematic abuse of the minority Uyghur population in China's far west.

The designation is the first by the US State Department since 2016, when then Secretary of State John Kerry determined that the atrocities committed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria amounted to genocide, and only among a handful of times a US administration has applied the term to an ongoing crisis.

Genocide is defined by the United Nations as ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" and although the US determination won't trigger any immediate penalties, it will put pressure on anyone who does business with China -- and that includes the 90 or so nations that are due to send athletes to the Winter Games in February next year.

""Right now there is a lot of pressure on any kind of major engagements with the Chinese government that involves lending (them) legitimacy,"" said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch.

The prospect of US athletes competing in the capital of a country accused of carrying out an ongoing genocide, will at the very least send mixed messages about Washington's commitment to human rights.

Beijing has long denied claims of genocide, claiming its policies in Xinjiang are part of a program of mass deradicalization and poverty alleviation. Last week a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Pompeo of spreading ""venomous"" lies, inviting people to visit Xinjiang to ""see with your own eyes.""

CNN has reached out to the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) for comment.

In a statement to CNN, the IOC said that it had received ""assurances"" from Chinese authorities that the principles of the Olympic Charter will be respected at the Beijing 2022 Games.

""Awarding the Olympic Games to a National Olympic Committee (NOC) does not mean that the IOC agrees with the political structure, social circumstances or human rights standards in its country,"" the statement said.

Activists and experts said that US' accusations will undoubtedly fuel calls for at least a partial boycott of the Games. In September 2020, more than 160 human rights groups around the world wrote to the IOC to reverse its decision to hold the 2022 Games in Beijing.

Mandie McKeown, executive director of the International Tibet Network, who coordinated the letter, said that if they were to put together another group letter now, the number of organizations would ""undoubtedly"" be higher.

She said if the Games couldn't be canceled, then her organization was advocating for a diplomatic boycott of the event, which would allow teams to attend while world leaders stayed away.

""The push for diplomatic boycott is definitely growing and noises (from governments) are positive,"" McKeown said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping talks with athletes and coaches of China's national figure skating and short track speed skating teams while visiting the Capital Gymnasium in Haidian District, Beijing, on January 18.

Politicizing the Games

Over the years there have been many calls for Olympic boycotts, either over alleged human rights abuses or for political purposes.

In 1936, shortly before the beginning of World War II, pressure was placed on countries to boycott the Summer Olympics in Berlin, which was presided over by then-Chancellor Adolf Hitler.

In 1976, more than 20 African nations boycotted the Montreal Summer Games over the participation of New Zealand athletes, after the country's rugby team defied the United Nations to go on a controversial tour of apartheid South Africa.

During the Cold War, the US and its allies boycotted the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow after which the Soviet Union then boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

But Susan Brownell, an Olympics expert and professor of anthropology at the University of Missouri-St Louis, said that from the Winter Olympics in Albertville in 1992 onwards there had been no national boycotts.

""A broad consensus opposing boycotts emerged among national governments worldwide because of the feeling that they accomplish nothing and only harm the athletes,"" she said.

There was a push by human rights organizations and NGOs for a boycott of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics over the Chinese government's restrictions on civil liberties, especially in regards to Tibetan minority groups, but in the end the Olympics went ahead as planned. ""No-one with the power to withdraw from the Games was seriously considering it,"" Brownell said.

But since then, allegations against Beijing in relation to mass detention camps in Xinjiang have mounted. Beijing claims it's offering Muslim minorities, including the Uyghurs, an education in Chinese language and values as part of its anti-terrorism program.

""Languages, traditional cultures and customs of all ethnic minorities in Xinjiang have been well protected and inherited. All residents fully enjoy their rights, including the right to subsistence and development,"" said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on January 20.

However, Uyghurs in exile say their families are being imprisoned for arbitrary offenses and subjected to forced labor and abuse.

Even without formal boycotts, the 2022 event is likely to attract protests, though mass demonstrations won't be possible in a country that prides itself on maintaining order.

McKeown, from the International Tibet Network, said her organization and other groups working with it would be undertaking a program of action, including protests around the world, in the lead up to the 2022 Beijing Games to draw attention to the Chinese government's human rights abuses.

She said for now they were advocating for a political boycott, rather than a total boycott, for the sake of the athletes.

""Athletes have worked incredibly hard to get where they are. It's not necessarily their concern that the IOC made such a terrible mistake in giving the Games to Beijing,"" she said.

Individual athletes could still boycott the 2022 Games, although this would mean compromising years of training and lucrative sponsorships. Under Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, any political protests by individual competitors at the Games are banned.

'The power of sport'

An Olympics can still be heavily political even if there's no boycotts, and the 2022 Beijing Games are likely to be no exception.

In 2018, at the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, North and South Korea marched in the Opening Ceremony under a United Korea banner, a powerful symbol of unity between the two divided nations.

But the 2018 Games came at the same time as rising tensions between the US and North Korea. At the Opening Ceremony, then-US Vice President Mike Pence appeared to act coldly towards North Korean representatives, including the sister of leader Kim Jong Un.

A boycott by Western political leaders of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2022 Games is possible, said Olympic expert Brownell, but she added that given Winter Olympics rarely attracted the attention of the Summer Games, many leaders were unlikely to go in the first place.

Brownell said that she believed the worst damage to the Olympics' reputation didn't come from an association with China or human rights issues. ""The damage seems to have come from the perception of excess cost to the taxpayer and corruption in the IOC,"" she said.

Despite the genocide ruling by the US, no countries have publicly moved to downsize relations with the Chinese government. And signs point to stronger ties, not weaker. In late December, for example, the European Union struck a wide-reaching investment agreement with Beijing despite the concerns of human rights organizations.

Human rights activists said it was too early to say whether or not a boycott of the 2022 Games, political or otherwise, was likely to go ahead.

And that's assuming the Games even go ahead as planned. Events in Beijing are scheduled to begin on Friday, February 4, 2022 -- just over 12 months away. But as the postponement of last year's Summer Games in Tokyo has shown, the coronavirus pandemic has thrown doubt on countries' ability to host large sporting events.

With numerous potential problems ahead, Wang, of Human Rights Watch, said the Chinese government needed to be given a chance to respond to international concerns over their actions in Xinjiang and the crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong.

But Wang said that she found it hard to see that happening and without demonstrable changes in Beijing's behavior, there could be a ""change of perception among other governments.""

""They are going to have to make a decision,"" Wang said. Human Rights Watch is currently not calling for any boycott of the 2022 Games.

In response to a question about a potential boycott in 2022 on January 20, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that ""preparations are being smoothly carried out."" ""We have confidence that it will be an extraordinary gathering,"" she said.

In 2017, the IOC announced that it would add human rights, anti-corruption and sustainable development clauses to Olympic Host City contracts in the future. However, the new rules will only come into place after the 2022 Winter Olympics, beginning with the 2024 Summer Games. It is unclear how the clauses will be policed or what will happen if a host city breaks them.

In its statement to CNN, the IOC said that it recognizes and upholds human rights but at the same time, couldn't change laws or the political system in a sovereign country. ""This must rightfully remain the legitimate role of governments and respective intergovernmental organizations,"" the statement said.

The IOC said that the Olympic Games had a unique role in bringing the world together.

""In our fragile world, the power of sport to bring the whole world together, despite all the existing differences, gives us all hope for a better future,"" the statement said.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly named Munich as the host city of the 1936 Olympic Games. The Games were held in Berlin."
"January has been the deadliest month for Covid-19 with nearly 80,000 lives lost so far in the US","(CNN) January has already become the worst month for US Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic.

As of Tuesday, there have been more than 79,000 coronavirus fatalities, topping the previous record set in December by more than a thousand, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The grim milestone underpins the growing demand from state officials for more vaccines so that Americans can be inoculated more quickly.

On Tuesday, President Joe Biden's Covid-19 coordinator, Jeff Zients, told governors that allocations would increase by around 16% starting next week, according to a source with knowledge of the call.

Biden has pushed for 100 million vaccination shots in the first 100 days of his presidency, but with a long road ahead for vaccinations, he also called for 100 days of mask-wearing.

""The brutal truth is it's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. Months. In the next few months, masks, not vaccines, are the best defense against Covid-19,"" Biden said while announcing the federal government would buy and distribute more vaccine doses from Moderna and Pfizer.

With those additional doses, Biden said there would be enough to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans -- nearly the entire US population -- by the end of summer or early fall.

Supply of vaccines not meeting demand

Struggling after the stress of nearly a year of responding to the pandemic, states are eager to administer vaccines quickly and attempt a return to life as normal.

""We have to defeat it because Mississippians are done. We're done burying loved ones who were lost to this virus. We're done with stressed hospitals. We're done with the fearful talk of lockdowns and shutdowns. We're ready for community again,"" said Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, who announced that the state celebrated about 200,000 vaccines delivered.

The director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said he was ""very encouraged"" by the new presidential administration's approach to vaccinations, but said the state is still struggling with the dearth of vaccines.

""We know that right now the number of individuals who want to be vaccinated greatly outstrips the supply of vaccine that we have available,"" Dr. Nirav Shah said.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said his conversations with the Biden administration have made him feel hopeful about the future of vaccine distribution, but that ""we cannot yet count on additional supply yet.""

Even if the administration delivers on the 16% increase in allocations promised, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace that it won't be enough.

""We're functionally out. We start to get a new allocation over the next few days,"" Cuomo said.

Indiana will receive almost 13,000 more doses if it gets 16% more, Gov. Eric Holcomb said Wednesday.

""That will not go to waste,"" said Holcomb. ""Like Governor Polis and 48 other governors, we need more.""

As of Wednesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 20 million people have gotten at least one dose of a vaccine, a benchmark the Trump administration had said would be reached by the end of 2020.

More than 47 million doses have been distributed to states, though, and the discrepancy between the number of people vaccinated and the doses distributed can at least partly be attributed to states holding back enough to give people a second dose , as required for both vaccines now approved in the United States, health officials said.

""Some of what the states have right now is inventory to do the very, very important second shot,"" White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said Wednesday.

""I think it's important that when you're looking at states' inventories that you recognize that some of that inventory is being held for the very important second shot.""

Some of the distributed doses may have also just arrived at their destination or may still be on the way, and there's also a lag in reporting the number of shots given, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a CNN town hall Wednesday night.

Still, a bottleneck remains, she said.

""When you do all that math, you still end up with some millions of doses that are sitting on the shelves and have not yet been administered,"" Walensky said.

""And in fact, that's one of the ways that we have to get resources to the states to make sure that they can quickly administer the vaccines that are on the shelves.""

Variants stoke demand and fears

Adding to public fears is the spread of variants of the coronavirus.

On Tuesday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that two cases of the variant first identified in the United Kingdom have been confirmed in the state.

The variant, called B.1.1.7, has been shown to spread especially quickly, according to modeling by the CDC. And a UK report released Friday states there is ""a realistic possibility"" that the new variant has a higher death rate than other variants.

It has been detected in more than 20 US states, and New York has 42 known cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said Wednesday.

The variant and others reported around the country are beginning to affect test results, Dr. Timothy Stenzel, director of the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, said in a briefing Wednesday.

The agency is asking test developers to ensure their tests can detect the virus as it continues to mutate, Stenzel said.

""We are going to start beginning to ask developers how they think they can monitor for variants of concern,"" he said.

The threat of variants has made reopening the state a greater concern in California, a recent epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, Los Angeles County public health director Barbara Ferrer said.

""This would not be the time to think just because we are reopening that things are looking rosy,"" she said noting that asymptomatic spread is a problem. ""We do need to move through the next few weeks with caution. At many other points where we've been reopening our sectors, we in fact have seen a bump up in our cases (and) we can't really afford that.""

Los Angeles County reported 307 Covid-19 deaths Wednesday, its second-highest number in a single day. The highest number was 318 on January 8.

The good news is that the B.1.1.7 variant doesn't seem to affect the efficacy of the vaccines now available at all, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert.

Tests indicate that a variant first seen in South Africa may interfere with vaccine response somewhat, but not significantly.

For his part, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tried to calm fears around the variants with assurances that the groundwork is already being laid to fight them.

""We should not be frightened, but I think we need to be prepared,"" Bourla said at the Bloomberg The Year Ahead event Tuesday. ""Once we discover something that it is not as effective, we will very, very quickly produce a booster dose that will be a small variation to the current one.""

School reopening safety

Meanwhile, there was a glimmer of good news Tuesday for parents who are hoping to return their kids to school.

A report from the CDC said that with the right mitigation strategies, it's possible to open K-12 schools for in-person learning with minimal Covid-19 transmission.

Those mitigation strategies include wearing masks, social distancing and limiting time in shared indoor spaces, according to the study from the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said he aims to have anyone who works in a school receive their first vaccine dose in the month of February at the very least in hopes of sending all students back to school by March 1.

Currently, people older than 75 and those with certain medical conditions are able to receive vaccines. On February 1, those 70 and older and employees of K-12 schools will be eligible for the vaccine, he said in a news conference Tuesday.

School reopenings have been a priority for many officials as students across the country have spent months learning remotely. But local leaders have approached the return in various ways.

Of the 20 largest school districts in the country, nine are currently all online, eight offer a choice of either full in-person or all online, two have a hybrid plan and one in Hawaii varies plans based on infection rates among different islands."
"Nearly half of Americans eager for coronavirus vaccine, survey finds","Syringes filled with the Covid-19 vaccine await to be administered at the Kedren Community Health Center in Los Angeles, California on January 25. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images

Close to half of Americans say they are eager to get a coronavirus vaccine or have already gotten one, according to a January survey published Wednesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The survey of more than 1,500 adults found that 41% want the vaccine and 6% have already gotten at least one dose.

That’s considerably higher than the 34% reported in December, said KFF, which studies health policy.

In the new survey, 31% said they would like to wait and see how the vaccine works for others before they get one themselves. Some 7% will only get one if “required to do so for work, school or other activities,” while 13% said they would “definitely not” get it.

And of course, politics plays a role.

“While vaccine enthusiasm increased for both Democrats and independents, it has not shifted among Republicans, who remain the most resistant, with 33% saying they will definitely not get the vaccine or will get it only if required to do so for work, school or other activities,” Kaiser said in a statement.

The survey also looked into what might motivate people to take the vaccine.

Some 57% of those surveyed would be more likely to get vaccinated if told the vaccines are highly effective in preventing illness, and 54% said they would be more likely to get vaccinated if told it was the quickest way for life to return to normal.

Just under half, 46%, were impressed by hearing millions of people have been safely vaccinated, and 45% were motivated by being told we need people to be vaccinated to get the US economy back on track."
12 Houston police officers have been charged in connection with a botched 2019 raid,"(CNN) A total of 12 officers have now been indicted in connection with a 2019 botched raid that left two people dead in Houston.

Six officers were indicted last year, including Gerald Goines, who is accused of lying to obtain a warrant, and Steven Bryant, who is accused of tampering with government records.

Six other officers were indicted Monday, according to a statement from Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg. Those officers face a variety of charges including murder, tampering with government records and engaging in organized criminal activity.

The raid took place January 28, 2019, when a tactical team raided the home of Rhogena Nicholas and Dennis Tuttle, who were both killed along with their dog. Several Houston officers on the team were injured in the raid, including Goines.

""The consequences of corruption are that two innocent people and their dog were shot to death in their home by police; four officers were shot, one paralyzed, and now all of them will face jurors who will determine their fate,"" Ogg's statement read.

"South Korean mayor Park Won-soon sexually harassed secretary before his death, report finds","Seoul, South Korea (CNN) Seoul's former mayor died last year in an apparent suicide after his secretary accused him of sexual harassment. Now, an investigation by a human rights watchdog in South Korea has found that her accusations were credible.

In a report released Monday, the independent National Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRC) found that former mayor Park Won-soon's words and actions toward his secretary constituted sexual harassment under the country's laws.

The finding is significant as the alleged victim's case against Park -- who was South Korea's second-most powerful official when he died -- was never heard in court.

Park, a self-proclaimed feminist was found dead on a mountainside near his official residence in July after a seven-hour search. Following his death, police confirmed that sexual harassment claims had been filed against him. According to the alleged victim's lawyer, the complaint was filed on July 8 -- one day before Park went missing.

That sparked a firestorm in South Korea, with some expressing anger that Park's accuser would never get justice. Under South Korean law, when a suspect dies, open investigations are closed as the prosecutors have no ground to make an indictment.

Several investigations were launched into the harassment allegations, including whether the city government had been complicit in allowing workplace sexual harassment.

But the alleged victim also faced huge backlash online from those mourning Park's death. Monday's report adds credence to her accusation that he harassed her for four years, even after she moved to a different department.

""I've had a tough four years, but the past six months have been particularly tough,"" the alleged victim -- who cannot be named under South Korean law -- said in a statement.

What the report found

The commission interviewed Park's accuser and 51 witnesses, and analyzed documents submitted by the city government, police, prosecutors and Presidential Office.

The report found that the alleged victim, who was employed as Park's secretary, was asked to take care of intimate aspects of his life, including handling his undergarments before and after he showered. Witnesses also testified that Park sent ""inappropriate texts and photos"" to the alleged victim. Last year, the secretary's lawyer Kim Jae-ryon said Park had sent her pictures of himself in his underwear, as well as obscene, late-night messages over the encrypted app Telegram.

Ultimately, the commission found that the alleged victim's accusations against Park were credible based on evidence and testimony from witnesses.

The NHRC also concluded that the Seoul city government failed to properly think about how its hierarchical structure had contributed to sexual harassment, which impacted Park's accuser.

Acting Mayor Seo Jeong-hyup said in a statement that he ""humbly accepted"" the results of NHRC's investigation. The statement also said that the Seoul City government ""politely apologizes to the employee, her family, and the citizens who have been greatly disappointed and concerned by this."" The government would take action to prevent a similar situation from happening again, the statement added.

But Park's accuser and her advocates said that more needed to be done to prevent similar situations from occurring.

In a statement this week, the alleged victim said that clarifying the truth was important. But it was even more crucial for government agencies to think about ways they could change to improve the situation for victims of sexual harassment, she said. Her lawyer Kim told CNN that while the result was meaningful, she was disappointed that the commission did not rule on how the alleged victim's colleagues and supervisors behaved at the time. When the alleged victim complained about Park's behavior internally, staff at the Seoul City Government told her that he ""wasn't that kind of person,"" the former secretary claimed last year.

Korean Women's Hot Line also pointed to how supporters of the late mayor had attacked Park's accuser online in order to defend their own political interests. The group called for fake news and photos of the alleged victim to be taken down, and for perpetrators to be punished.

Bigger picture

The accusations against Park were striking, not only because of his powerful position, but also because he was seen as a progressive leader and a symbol of reform.

A former human rights lawyer, in the 1990s Park represented the victim in one of South Korea's first successful sexual harassment convictions. In the 1980s, he was part of the team of lawyers who represented one of the first women to bring charges of sexual assault against authorities.

For nine years he had served as Seoul's mayor and was seen as a potential presidential candidate.

But Park is one of several politicians from across the political spectrum who have been accused of sexual crimes in recent years.

On Monday -- the same day NHRC's report was released -- the leader of the progressive Justice Party Kim Jong-cheol was removed from his position following accusations that he sexually harassed a lawmaker from his party.

In 2019, former governor and one-time presidential contender Ahn Hee-jung was sentenced to more than three years for the rape and assault of his former assistant. And last year, Oh Keo-don, the mayor of South Korea's second-largest city, Busan, resigned and apologized for sexual harassment. Both Ahn and Oh were members of President Moon Jae-in's Democratic Party.

In 2017, Moon vowed to become a ""feminist president"" and prompted action on issues such as sexual harassment.

For the past few years, South Korea has faced a reckoning against its deeply patriarchal culture. Women have pushed back against discrimination in the workplace, sexual violence and harassment, and unreasonable beauty standards. Nevertheless, the country continues to rank poorly globally for female representation in government and wage equality."
Retirements shake up 2022 map as Republican senators eye exits,"(CNN) Senate GOP leaders are bracing for more retirements within their ranks, as a handful of senior Republicans decline to commit to running again -- following four tumultuous years in the Trump era and facing a polarized political climate ahead.

Three Republican senators have already decided to retire in 2022, including Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, whose announcement on Monday stunned his colleagues and ignited an all-out scramble in both parties to line up candidates to fill the crucial seat.

But in interviews with CNN, several other GOP senators sidestepped questions about their political futures or made clear they were truly undecided about running again, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Richard Shelby of Alabama.

Thune, 60, said he would make his announcement ""at some point in the future"" while brushing aside questions about his thinking. Johnson, 65, said he didn't think he had to decide ""for a while."" Grassley, 87, said he would make his announcement in ""several months."" Shelby, 86, said, ""I'll let you know.""

The party out of power typically gains seats in a president's first midterm election, but Republicans will have to defend 20 of their Senate seats in 2022, while Democrats only have to defend 14 seats.

And the retirements of Portman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey have given Democrats greater hope of winning those seats and retaining their slim Senate majority. The Republicans' decisions have sparked primaries that could cost millions and bruise whoever emerges as the party's nominees against the Democrats.

The three retirements were somewhat of a surprise since Portman, Burr and Toomey hover around the Senate's average age of about 62 years old. Yet they've bemoaned the Senate as an increasingly divided institution without the willpower to break the partisan gridlock. As of now, there are no Democratic senators who have decided to step aside, though that could quickly change.

Johnson's choice is the most crucial in terms of the future control of the Senate, since his swing state went for Biden in 2020 by less than a point . The Wisconsin senator said he would ""work hard"" to ""make it possible for either myself or somebody else to keep that seat in Republican hands.""

When asked why he would stay in the Senate, Johnson said ""to be a firewall"" against Democratic control of Washington.

""I'm not a fan of this place,"" Johnson said of the Senate. ""I think this place is horribly dysfunctional.""

Other Republican senators from competitive states sounded like they would run again, even though some wouldn't say so explicitly.

Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the Republican leadership, said that he has not made an ""official announcement.""

""When I do, that's when the campaign will officially start,"" he added.

And as she entered the Senate subway in the Capitol, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told CNN, ""I'm running."" Utah Sen. Mitt Romney then interjected, ""for now,"" and smiled.

A number of other senators from deep red states have not announced their new campaigns, but told CNN that they intend to run, including GOP Sens. Mike Crapo of Idaho, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Jerry Moran of Kansas and John Boozman of Arkansas.

""I am running for the border first, and reelection second,"" said Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy.

While Republicans are uncertain which of their members may be the next to call it quits, the decision by Portman caught many off-guard. ""He's a big loss, a big loss for the caucus, really for the country,"" Thune said of Portman.

The Ohio Republican also had a unique connection to his state, winning his last race in 2016 by 20 points against former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland.

""I was surprised,"" Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told CNN of Portman's decision. When asked if the NRSC would get involved in the primary, Scott said: ""I don't know. I know that people have in the past, so we'll see. It will be a new experience.""

Scott has personally urged each of his incumbents to run again but said that Republicans would keep the US Senate seat in Ohio.

""It's another race that we'll raise the money for and win,"" he said. ""We're off and running. We're talking to candidates, we're recruiting candidates, we're raising money.""

But Democrats said the GOP retirements would be a boon to their chances of keeping the Senate.

""With Ohio now joining Pennsylvania and North Carolina as another open seat liability in a major battleground state, Republicans are confronting messy and divisive primaries and a 2022 map that keeps getting harder to defend,"" said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Stewart Boss.

Aspiring senators are now mulling their options and jockeying for donors. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said he raised more than $1 million in two weeks since announcing he'd consider a bid. In North Carolina, former GOP Rep. Mark Walker , and Democrats Jeff Jackson and Erica Smith, have already announced Senate campaigns, while others, including Lara Trump, former President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, ponder launching theirs.

Within hours of Portman's announcement came speculation that Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a close ally and vocal defender of Trump, would run. Other possible GOP candidates include: J.D. Vance, the author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" Josh Mandel, who dropped out of the 2018 GOP primary race to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Jon Husted, the state's lieutenant governor. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is also seriously eying a Senate bid, along with at least four other Republican members of Congress: Rep. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup, Mike Turner and Warren Davidson. Rep. Tim Ryan is among the Democrats ruminating a run.

The Senate is currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking tie votes, giving Democrats control of the chamber.

Two of the most competitive Senate seats in 2022 could be in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, which are held by Republicans Toomey and Burr. But two new Democratic senators, Mark Kelly and Raphael Warnock will have to defend seats in Arizona and Georgia, which have only recently trended blue.

Republicans recognize that their work will be cut out for them if more of their colleagues step aside.

""It certainly creates more focus on candidate recruitment,"" said Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican who is running for reelection in South Carolina next year. Retirements, he said, amount to a ""loss of institutional knowledge on our side that's impossible to replace.""

""But finding interesting, fascinating and exciting candidates will be our task,"" Scott said."
Republicans still have one big card to play this year,"(CNN) There's no question that Republicans are not in a good spot politically at the moment.

Not only are they out of power in the White House, the Senate and the House, they are in the early stages of a civil war between pro-Trump forces and the establishment wing of the party that is going to get much, much uglier.

But before you start writing the political obituary for the Republican Party in Washington, you need to consider this oft-ignored but critically important card that the GOP still has in hand: The Republican Party will control the bulk of the redistricting processes in the country.

Wrote David Wasserman, The Cook Political Report's House editor , in his big look at the state of redistricting on Tuesday:

""Republicans may not be as dominant as they were in 2011 when they redrew nearly five times as many congressional seats as Democrats. But they still hold far more raw power. They fared well in 2020's state legislative elections and maintained control of several huge prizes: Texas, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, which are collectively poised to gain six seats from the Census.""

There will be no inductees in the Baseball Hall of Fame class of 2021,"(CNN) The National Baseball Hall of Fame class of 2021 is empty.

None of the 25 eligible candidates received the minimum of 75% of ballots cast to be elected, according to a news release from the Hall of Fame Tuesday. Of the 25, there were 11 new candidates and 14 returnees.

The last time the Baseball Writers' Association of America didn't vote in any players was in 2013, and this is also the first time since 1960 that there were no new hall of fame members in a single year, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame's website.

Three of those names back on the ballot included Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling. All three have one year left of eligibility.

Schilling fell short 16 votes, leaving him with only 71.1% of the electorate. Bonds' vote total was at 61.8%, and Clemens was at 61.6%.

Vaccine rollout stumbles as a 'Hunger Games' approach leaves states and counties to fend for themselves,"(CNN) Eighty-year-old Belma Requejo of Los Angeles County is trapped in her home with her 83-year-old husband and two other elderly relatives.

They are waiting for a coronavirus vaccine. Every day for a week, her daughter, Maria -- who lives in the same household with her two children -- has tried to get on the county's website to make an appointment. And every time, Maria is told there is no availability.

Meanwhile, Covid-19 has ravaged their densely populated section of Long Beach; just last week the disease claimed the life of a neighbor.

""I can't even walk in the park -- I'm afraid,"" Requejo said. ""We are surrounded by Covid.""

As Covid-19 continues its rampage across the country -- and as new variants pose the threat of increased transmissibility -- the urgent campaign to vaccinate Americans has been frustratingly sluggish.

Earlier this month in Fort Myers, Florida, seniors spent a night lined up outside a local health office for the chance to get their coronavirus vaccine. In Phoenix, computer glitches sent health workers driving across the state to remote vaccination locations.

Many states -- including New York, South Carolina, Hawaii and Florida -- have had to cancel or delay thousands of vaccination appointments.

Although the reasons for the holdups vary depending on the state and county, the primary causes boil down to two problems: a shortage of supply and the unpredictability of shipment sizes, say more than a dozen experts and health officials who spoke with CNN.

Meanwhile, there is concern among state and local health officials that the supply crunch will leave people who have gotten one dose of the vaccine unable to get the second and final dose in time.

Some chalk up the logistical nightmare to the lack of a central message from Operation Warp Speed, the federal initiative to inoculate Americans.

""It feels like the feds' plan stopped at the state borders, and the states expected the feds' plan to stop at people's arms,"" Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, chief clinical officer for Providence health system, which includes 51 hospitals, told CNN. ""I think having a federal plan would absolutely stop the kind of 'Hunger Games' approach to every individual state, every individual county scrambling for their own set of rules.""

President Joe Biden has said he intends to ramp up vaccinations in the coming weeks.

Six weeks into the rollout, 23.5 million shots have been administered, according a tracker from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The pace of vaccination has been accelerating. Until last week, the US was administering about 462,000 doses a day. That rose to nearly a million over the last week.

On Tuesday, Biden's Covid coordinator, Jeff Zients, informed governors on a call that Covid-19 vaccine allocations for states would increase by 16% starting next week, according to a source with knowledge of the call.

And the administration announced that while it remains committed, for now, to delivering 100 million doses in the first 100 days -- an average of 1 million a day -- it will boost weekly supply, increase transparency and purchase additional vaccine from the two companies with circulating vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna.

The goal of the plan is to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by summer's end and achieve herd immunity, in which the percentage of the immunized population is so high that person-to-person transmission becomes unlikely.

Vaccine demand outpacing supply

But vaccine expert Peter Hotez says to achieve herd immunity by summer, the US will need 3 million doses a day.

Noting the dangerous new variants, Hotez said time is of the essence, and stressed that other vaccines in addition to the two versions in use need to quickly be authorized.

""The variant seems to be accelerating and is scaring the crap out of everyone, including me,"" said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.

Both vaccine makers -- Pfizer and Moderna -- say they are on track to provide the federal government 200 million doses each by July 31, as outlined in their contracts.

""Production and releases are not linear and we have explained that we have been successfully scaling up our production yields over time,"" said a Moderna spokesperson.

Still, the granular, day-to-day realities of getting vaccines into the arms of people has been a logistical nightmare for many providers across America.

Officials in Louisiana say they could be vaccinating more people were it not for one major, overarching problem.

""We are simply limited by the supply we get,"" said Dr. Joseph Kanter, the state's top health officer and the lead physician with the state's department of health. ""There is simply much more demand than there is vaccine available. There are many more people eligible and who want the vaccine than there is vaccine we have to give.""

Inside Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the mass vaccination center could be inoculating up to 2,000 people a day. But on Monday, it had just 150 appointments.

""We're preserving the appointments for how many doses are available,"" Sarah Apatov, a volunteer who was administering doses, told CNN.

Health officials in Georgia said they are pushing out the vaccine as quickly as possible. Dr. Lynn Paxton, Fulton County district health director, said her team has the capacity to vaccinate 50,000 people a week, but have had to settle for around 10,000.

""We have to be very judicious in how we schedule our appointments,"" she said. ""And the important thing I want everyone to know is that we are in no way hoarding these vaccine doses.""

Unpredictable shipments impair planning

Some officials told CNN that the size of the dose shipments they've received have been wildly out of step with expectations, crippling their efforts to adequately plan.

""The things that the federal government said it was going to do, which was to allocate vaccines to states and give them a sense of how many doses they would get based on their population size, that seems itself not to even play out the way that they said,"" said Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. ""States to counties to facilities don't have predictability or visibility on the number of doses they're going to get, either like in a week or two out or even the next month.""

Compton-Phillips of Providence health said the planning challenges have forced hospitals to turn away even people who are over 65 with heart disease.

""We're saying, 'We're sorry, but we don't have a vaccine for you today and we're not really sure what our supply is going to be and not sure when we can give it to you,'"" she said. ""So, it's a really uncomfortable position to be in.""

Lori Tremmel Freeman, of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, calls the situation a ""world of uncertainty.""

""This becomes just a tremendous issue when they're trying to plan mass vaccination clinics, drive-through clinics, scheduling for all these priority groups and ... really getting things rolling,"" she said.

In Washington state, a surprise change of plans will likely force thousands of residents to find a new location to get their second dose.

""We had a clinic in downtown Seattle that's been running for the past couple of weeks doing over 2,200 immunizations a day,"" said Compton-Phillips of Providence. ""We heard last week that our allocation would be cut back by 90 percent so that they could take the same amount of vaccine that the state is getting and spread it out. ... How are we going to get everybody dose two?""

Some state officials are so frustrated with the supply shortage they're tapping into the second-dose reserves.

Last week, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis directed providers ""to use all the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine they have including the ones that were designated as second doses to use them as first doses this week."" The directive applied to those ages 70 and up.

""Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,"" Polis said at a January 19 news conference

Similarly, in Utah, officials will redesignate second doses for people who haven't shown up to get them within a week as first doses.

In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Biden should order governments across the country to reassign second doses as first doses immediately.

""Start using them right now,"" he said on MSNBC, adding that sitting on them ""doesn't make sense.""

A former Trump administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to comment publicly, said states that want a more predictable cadence of supply can solve the problem by stockpiling the vaccine for three or four weeks.

""But I don't think states or local public health departments would like that either, because the goal is to get vaccine out as quickly as you can,"" the official said. ""So, in that environment where you are shipping doses out on the edges of them coming off the lines, there is just inherent uncertainty."""
Goldman Sachs slashes CEO pay by $10 million over massive scandal,"New York (CNN Business) Goldman Sachs cut chief executive David Solomon's annual compensation by $10 million, or 36%, following a penalty deduction that resulted from the bank's role in a corruption scandal involving a Malaysian investment fund, known as 1MDB.

Solomon's compensation package was reduced to $17.5 million for 2020, down from the $27.5 million he received in 2019, according to a US Securities and Exchange filing on Tuesday. The $10 million payout comes after Goldman agreed to pay nearly $3 billion after pleading guilty to charges the bank conspired to violate US anti-bribery laws in a massive scandal with 1MDB.

In October, the bank said that Solomon would face a pay cut, along with other top executives including its CFO Stephen Scherr and COO John Waldron in light of findings from the investigation that involved the US Department of Justice and other authorities.

Goldman Sachs GS The scandal relates to bond sales thatarranged and underwrote for 1MDB, from which the US Justice Department alleges $4.5 billion was stolen. The Justice Department accused Malaysian financier Jho Low, who had ties to the film ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" of masterminding a plot to channel the money from the fund to former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's bank accounts.

Scherr's pay was reduced to $15.5 million from $22.5 million in 2019. Waldron's pay was slashed to $18.5 million, down from $24.5 million in 2019. In total, the three executives' total compensation for 2020 was reduced by $24 million in response to the bribery scandal fallout.

Florida led the world in shark attacks again in 2020,"(CNN) The US is once again the shark attack capital of the world in 2020. Thanks, Florida!

Last year, the US reported 33 unprovoked shark attacks, accounting for about 58% of the total number of unprovoked shark attacks that occurred worldwide, according to the Yearly World Shark Attack Summary from the International Shark Attack File (ISAF).

This is a decrease from 2019, when 64% of the global unprovoked bites occurred in the US.

ISAF categorizes shark attacks by first deciding if they were provoked or unprovoked.

""Unprovoked attacks are defined as incidents in which an attack on a live human occurs in the shark's natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark,"" ISAF said.

""Provoked attacks occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way. These include instances when divers are bitten after harassing or trying to touch sharks, bites on spearfishers, bites on people attempting to feed sharks, bites occurring while unhooking or removing a shark from a fishing net and so forth.""

ISAF said it investigated 129 alleged shark-human interactions worldwide in 2020 -- 57 were unprovoked shark bites on humans, and 39 were provoked bites.

Of the 33 unprovoked shark attacks in the US, 16 of them were in Florida. The state's 16 cases represent 28% of unprovoked bites worldwide.

""For decades, Florida has topped global charts in the number of shark bites, and this trend continued in 2020,"" ISAF said in its summary. ""However, the state saw a significant drop from its most recent five-year annual average of 30 incidents.""

Eight of the shark bites in Florida, or 50% of the state's total in 2020, occurred in Volusia County, according to the ISAF.

How the pandemic impacted shark attack reporting process

ISAF said that while the incidence of bites both in the US and globally have been declining over time, ""2020's numbers represent a more drastic drop than would be expected.""

Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark research program, said that Covid-19's impact was something he and his colleagues speculated about back in March.

According to Naylor, the pandemic hasn't necessarily caused a drop in cases -- but it has impacted researchers' ability to follow-up and confirm cases when they are reported.

""We typically talk to emergency room doctors and nurses to create our reports,"" Naylor said. ""However, they've been so overwhelmed with the Covid-19 response that they haven't always had time to talk to a bunch of scientists that are asking detailed questions about a shark attack.""

Based on its research in the last year, ISAF said the ""observed drop in shark bite incidents may have been caused by the widespread quarantines, closed beaches and minimized vacation travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Spike in shark-related fatalities reported worldwide

There were 13 shark-related fatalities this year, 10 of which were confirmed to be unprovoked, ISAF said in its Yearly Worldwide Shark Attack Summary.

""This number is above the annual global average of four unprovoked fatalities per year,"" ISAF wrote.

But, ""despite 2020's spike in fatalities, long-term trends show a decreasing number of annual fatalities. Year-to-year variability in oceanographic, socioeconomic and meteorological conditions significantly influences the local abundance of sharks and humans in the water.""

Of the global fatalities, Australia saw ""a higher incidence of fatal bites than normal in 2020,"" ISAF said. The country had six confirmed fatal shark attacks.

""Australians are not naive when it comes to the inherent dangers of surfing and swimming,"" Naylor said. ""So I was surprised that the number was as high as it was this year.""

Meanwhile, in the US, there were three confirmed fatal shark attacks last year. This is an increase from 2019, when there weren't any confirmed cases in the US.

The three fatal attacks happened in Hawaii, California and Maine. Although Florida is usually home to most of the unprovoked attacks, the state didn't have any confirmed fatalities last year.

How to avoid a shark attack

Most bites -- 61% of the total cases in 2020 -- were related to surfing and board sports, ISAF said.

But don't worry: ""Short-term trends still show both fatal and non-fatal bites to be decreasing,"" ISAF said.

""The total number of unprovoked shark bites worldwide is extremely low, given the number of people participating in aquatic recreation each year.""

Should you find yourself in the sea, ISAF said there are many ways to avoid a shark attack.

ISAF encourages people ""avoid being in the water during darkness or twilight hours when sharks are most active and have a competitive sensory advantage.""

The organization also urges people to not enter the water if they are bleeding, because ""a shark's olfactory ability is acute.""

Shiny jewelry can also attract sharks, as ""the reflected light resembles the sheen of fish scales.""

ISAF also encouraged people to avoid wearing bright swimwear or dive gear, because ""any high contrast color apparel or gear used by a human in the water is especially visible to sharks."""
Biden chief of staff: President wants schools open but US must 'make the investments' needed to safely return,"(CNN) President Joe Biden wants schools to reopen but believes Congress must make the necessary investments to safely return to in-person learning, his chief of staff Ron Klain said Tuesday, on the heels of several school districts' last-minute canceled re-openings and a government study indicating teaching kids in person is possible with the right precautions.

""I'll give you a word: Money,"" Klain told CNN's Erin Burnett when asked why he thought some public schools across the country are still closed in places where private schools are open. ""That's why the President of the United States sent a plan into Congress, even before he took office, to make the investments you need to make the schools safe.""

Klain referenced a study published Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which researchers looked at data on 17 K-12 schools in rural Wood County, Wisconsin, which conducted in-person learning last fall. They found lower Covid-19 case rates than in the community at large, and few cases of in-school transmission. Cohorts of 11 to 20 students from the same grade level met for classes and lunch indoors, where students were often seated next to the same person.

""Students in very small pods, classes of about 11 or 12, distanced, in a rural area -- they can go to school safely, and governors who made those investments,"" Klain said, adding that ""in other states, we haven't seen those kinds of investments.""

""President Biden has sent a plan to Congress that will make sure that a majority of our schools can be open within 100 days,"" he continued. ""We need Congress to pass that plan so we can do the kinds of things you need to do so that the schools can be safe, so the teachers can be safe, so the students can be safe -- sadly, it costs money.""

Trump impeachment: Democrats weigh whether they need witnesses to make a visceral case against Trump at impeachment trial,"(CNN) Facing highly skeptical Republican senators , House impeachment managers are preparing a case to show the visceral evidence of the Capitol insurrection and how former President Donald Trump's words and actions motivated the rioters to breach the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the deliberations.

The Senate's 55 to 45 procedural vote Tuesday is not deterring the House from making what they see is a clear case against Trump for his role inciting the insurrectionists. There are still key questions for them to decide before next month's trial: They haven't made a final decision, for instance, on whether they will call witnesses. They're preparing for the possibility they won't have any witnesses -- but they may decide to use them if they find a witness willing to voluntarily step forward, according to sources.

Even without witnesses, Democrats are considering using evidence from video and social media to help illustrate how Trump's words, actions and tweets motivated the rioters to attack the Capitol, the sources say.

The House managers are also preparing to make the constitutional argument -- they're led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a former constitutional law professor -- that the Senate can convict a former President, just as it's held trials for other former officials in the past. It's a case that's taken on newfound importance in the wake of the Senate's vote Tuesday that Sen. Rand Paul forced as part of his argument that most of the Republicans think the trial is unconstitutional -- and there simply aren't 17 Republican votes needed for conviction.

But Senate Democrats say that the case the House managers make can still sway some Republicans, particularly if they can use witnesses who would help corroborate Trump's mindset and actions leading up to the January 6 Capitol riots.

""I think that the core of this case is Trump's incendiary and inciting words, the words out of his own mouth,"" Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told reporters. ""But his intent to do harm, to cause injury and maybe even death may come from witnesses who were with him when he was watching the assault on the Capitol. So witnesses can corroborate and powerfully document what we know but they need to prove.""

One complicating factor for the House impeachment team is whether potential witnesses would be willing to be called -- particularly those who were in the White House. The House impeachment managers want to avoid any kind of court fight over witnesses like the House had to deal with during the first impeachment of Trump.

Sen. Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said Tuesday it was an open question whether executive privilege would still apply to former White House officials after Trump left office who could be called as potential witnesses. King argued that such testimony could shine light on the President's thinking during the time of the trial.

""It will be either witnesses or documents, and what was given in the way of intelligence,"" King said.

The opening day of Trump's second impeachment trial showed just how high the bar is for House Democrats to get anywhere close to the votes needed for conviction, with just five Republicans voting with Democrats to defeat Paul's procedural motion.

While not every Republican who voted with Paul said the trial was unconstitutional outright, the 55 to 45 vote was as clear a sign as any that the path to the 67 votes needed to convict Trump and bar him from running again was all but impossible. Paul claimed after the vote it showed the trial was already over before it started.

Even one of the Republicans who voted with Democrats and is opened to convicting Trump said the writing was on the wall.

""Do the math. I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that the President will be convicted,"" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one of the five Republicans to break with Paul.

Senate GOP focuses on constitutional argument

Following Tuesday's procedural vote to defeat Paul's point of order that the trial was unconstitutional, the Senate adjourned the impeachment trial until February 9, when arguments will begin.

Senate Republicans have coalesced in recent days around the argument that the trial is not constitutional, giving them a way to push back on House Democrats' impeachment without condoning Trump's conduct when rioters attacked the Capitol on January 6, breaching the very chamber where the impeachment trial will be held.

""I think it showed that impeachment is dead on arrival,"" Paul said of the vote he forced Tuesday. ""If you voted it was unconstitutional, how in the world would you ever vote to convict somebody for this?""

Democrats argued that Republicans were skirting their responsibility to hold Trump accountable for his behavior by claim the trial was unconstitutional. ""They don't want to be held accountable on that vote so they're going to try to make it another argument that is all about the Constitution,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.

There were signs ahead of Tuesday's vote that most Senate Republicans would stay united. At their party lunch Tuesday, Senate GOP leaders hosted Jonathan Turley, one of the leading conservative law scholars arguing that the trial is unconstitutional.

While Turley has argued against holding an impeachment trial for a former president, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote this month that ""most scholars who have closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.""

Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has said Trump committed impeachable offenses and voted against Paul on Tuesday, expressed frustration with the vote that occurred before the trial even started -- and with less than a day's notice.

""I think it was a little unfortunate that we had this very spontaneous vote on an extraordinarily significant matter without the considered debate and analysis. People had to make really quick decisions,"" Murkowski told reporters Tuesday. ""I'm not saying there's bad faith, but I do think this is significant enough that it deserved greater consideration by this body and I think what you've seen now is people have been forced to take a quick position. Whether or not that changes as we move forward I think remains to be seen.""

Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, downplayed the significance of Tuesday's vote, saying that he saw it as only a procedural motion and not a statement of whether the trial was constitutional or not.

""I want to hear it debated,"" Portman said. ""I do have questions about the constitutionality, and as a practical matter the precedent, but I want to hear it briefed, and we will hear it.""

But Senate GOP leaders remained united with Paul. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has expressed an openness to hearing the impeachment arguments , voted with Paul on Tuesday, in a sign he has questions about the constitutionality of the process. Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of GOP leadership who is up for reelection in 2022, said following the vote he believes the trial is unconstitutional.

""I believe the constitutional purpose of impeachment is to remove a president from office, not to punish a person after they have left office,"" Blunt said in a statement. ""No consideration was given to impeach President Nixon when he left office in 1974. The Constitution hasn't changed and the Congress should not set a new, destructive precedent.""

Several GOP senators have cited the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding over the trial -- with Senate president pro tempore Pat Leahy of Vermont presiding instead -- as the clearest sign that the trial doesn't pass constitutional muster.

""That would send a pretty clear signal to me what Roberts thinks of the whole thing,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican."
Joe Biden's defeat in Texas shows how the conservative judiciary can thwart his agenda,"(CNN) A federal judge's action Tuesday preventing President Joe Biden's 100-day pause in deportations demonstrated the land mines that await the new administration in the nation's courts.

The short-term order by the Texas-based judge could also force a confrontation up to the US Supreme Court, where the Biden legal team already faces hard choices over how aggressively to press new legal positions before the nine justices -- six of whom are conservatives, with three appointed by former President Donald Trump

US District Judge Drew Tipton, also a Trump appointee, sided on Tuesday with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Trump loyalist who has challenged Biden's temporary suspension of deportations.

The nationwide scope of Tipton's order further intensifies debate over broad-scale actions against the executive branch imposed by a lone judge, which were the bane of the Trump administration.

""These nationwide injunctions have frustrated presidential policy for most of the President's term with no clear end in sight,"" then-Attorney General William Barr declared in a 2019 speech.

Trump Justice Department lawyers routinely were able to convince the Supreme Court to lift those injunctions, although that sometimes took months. The conservative Supreme Court majority may not be as sympathetic to Biden's ventures as it was to Trump's.

All told, Tuesday's court action against an administration barely a week old reveals how tough it might be to advance a new agenda on immigration or any domestic policy if hit with lawsuits before judges who became increasingly right-wing during the Trump tenure.

As Biden promotes new programs and encounters legal objections, there is no escaping that they will be resolved by life-tenured judges, 30% of whom were named by Trump.

Dispute over pause in deportations

The pause on deportations, announced immediately after Biden's inauguration, reflects the desire to dismantle Trump's anti-immigrant practices. Biden also halted construction on the wall at the southern border.

Department of Homeland Security officials said the 100-day hold on deportations would allow the administration to review current practices and to ensure ""a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety.""

The moratorium, which began last Friday -- the day that Paxton sued -- excludes some categories of individuals, including those who came to the US after November 1, are suspected of terrorism or espionage or pose a danger to national security, and have waived rights to remain in the US.

Paxton, who led a failed lawsuit at the Supreme Court contesting Biden's election victory over Trump, contended that the 100-day suspension violated federal procedural requirements and breached a pact the Trump administration had made with Texas just before Trump left office. It dictated that the Department of Homeland Security would consult with the state before changing certain immigration practices.

It is not clear whether such recent agreements made with various states could be legally enforced. Tipton said he would need more time and additional legal briefing to review the question as he set the 14-day temporary restraining order.

But crucially, Tipton agreed with Texas that it appeared the suspension violated the Administrative Procedure Act's safeguards against ""arbitrary and capricious"" executive action.

The January 20 memorandum ""not only fails to consider potential policies more limited in scope and time, but it also fails to provide any concrete, reasonable justification for a 100-day pause on deportations,"" Tipton wrote.

Tipton said Texas had shown it could be hurt by the policy because of the millions of dollars it puts toward social services and other state benefits for undocumented immigrants.

Regarding his imposition of a nationwide order, he wrote that the ""100-day pause plainly affects national immigration policy, which demands uniformity.""

Federal judges often shudder at the suggestion that they would ideologically align with the presidents who appointed them, and Chief Justice John Roberts famously answered Trump's disparagement of an ""Obama judge"" with this admonition: ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.""

Regardless of Roberts' declaration, the fact remains that Biden may find a skeptical judiciary.

Trump filled 177 of the 682 district court judgeships and 54 of the 179 appeals court judgeships, according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution's Russell Wheeler -- in addition to the three new Supreme Court justices."
"Business exec and his wife charged after flying into remote Canadian town to get Covid-19 vaccine, officials say","(CNN) The former president and CEO of the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation and his wife are facing charges -- including failure to self-isolate -- after allegedly chartering a plane to a small town in western Canada and posing as local workers to receive the coronavirus vaccine.

Rodney and Ekaterina Baker have been charged under Yukon's Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) , according to court documents.

Yukon Community Services Minister John Streicker said the couple showed up at a mobile clinic last Thursday in Beaver Creek, home to an indigenous community.

One of them presented a British Columbia health care card, the other had one from Ontario, Streicker said in a statement.

The Bakers weren't charged for getting the vaccine. Rather, they were accused of not following quarantine requirements after arriving in the Canadian territory.

According to a charging document, the Bakers are from Vancouver, British Columbia, southeast of the Yukon territory.

""I am outraged by this selfish behaviour, and find it disturbing that people would choose to put fellow Canadians at risk in this manner,"" Streicker said. ""Reports allege these individuals were deceptive and violated emergency measures for their own advantage, which is completely unacceptable at any time, but especially during a public health crisis.""

CNN was unable Tuesday to reach the Bakers for comment.

Couple posed as local motel employees, reports say

Indigenous communities are one of the groups given priority for Covid-19 vaccinations, according to Canada's vaccine guidance . They are often also disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus because they can be in areas where health care access is limited.

Beaver Creek, the westernmost community in Canada, is the home of the White River First Nation. It is just a few miles from the Alaska border.

The Bakers allegedly chartered a plane from the city of Whitehorse in Yukon to Beaver Creek, which has about 125 residents, and claimed they were employees at a local motel, Streicker told CNN news partner CBC

The Bakers arrived in Yukon from Vancouver on January 19 and were supposed to be self-isolating for 14 days in Whitehorse, according to officials. According to a complaint made to law enforcement, they traveled to Beaver Creek on January 21. The travel was not allowed because of quarantine requirements, officials said.

After getting their shots, the couple raised suspicions in the community by asking for a ride to the airport, Streicker told CNN news partner CBC

""And people were like, 'Well, why would you be going to the airport?' "" Streicker said.

Following an investigation, the couple was located at the Whitehorse airport, and Yukon officials told CNN the couple left the territory that same day.

Members of the mobile clinic team called the motel and were informed the couple did not work there, Streicker told CBC.

CNN reached out to Streicker for comment on Tuesday but did not hear back.

As for getting the vaccines, according to Streicker, the British Columbia and Ontario health cards wouldn't have necessarily prevented the Bakers from getting them, as there are many out-of-territory workers in the region.

Rodney, 55, and Ekaterina Baker, 32, were each charged with failure to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry into the territory and failure to behave in a manner consistent with the declaration provided upon entry into the territory.

Charges under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) may include fines up to $500; up to 6 months in prison; or both, according to Yukon's Covid-19 orders and directions. The Bakers were each levied a $500 fine and $75 surcharge on both counts.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were alerted to the situation. The RCMP's Yukon office said Tuesday it is investigating; it would not reply to CNN questions.

The Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, a hotel and casino company with 25 Canadian properties, told CNN that while it didn't comment on personnel matters relating to former employees, effective January 24, Rodney Baker was no longer the president and CEO of Great Canadian and is ""no longer affiliated in any way with the company.""

""As a company, Great Canadian takes health and safety protocols extremely seriously, and our company strictly follows all directives and guidance issued by public health authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate,"" the statement added.

The White River First Nation said it ""is particularly concerned with the callous nature of these actions taken by the individuals, as they were a blatant disregard for the rules in which keep our community safe during this unprecedented global pandemic."""
Elon Musk tweet fuels frenzied GameStop surge,"(CNN Business) Amateur investors continued a frenzied runup of GameStop for the fourth session in a row, with the stock ending Tuesday up more than 92%, or about $148 a share.

Tesla TSLA After the market closed,CEO Elon Musk appeared to join the pile-on with a tweet that sent GameStop shares briefly above $200. His one-word comment — ""Gamestonk!!"" — was all it took to cheer on the the popular Reddit page that's been generating most of the hype around the stock.

That was the second Musk tweet in 24 hours to create a stir for an individual stock — Etsy shares spiked in premarket trading Tuesday following his declaration that he ""kinda"" loves the online craft market.

GameStop is up more than 680% so far this year — an improbable spike led by investors congregating on the WallStreetBets subreddit. Those traders have essentially declared war on GameStop's short sellers — investors who have placed bets that a stock would go down. The more GameStop climbs, the more money the short sellers lose."

Former Army secretary says DC National Guard had no plan ahead of Capitol riot beyond local traffic control,"(CNN) Former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told a House panel on Tuesday that the National Guard only planned to deal with traffic in Washington, DC, the day the deadly US Capitol insurrection occurred, with ""no contingency"" in place if things escalated in the city, according to a copy of his prepared testimony obtained by CNN.

But McCarthy also told Congress that alternate plans would only have happened if the US Capitol Police or local authorities in Washington requested it.

""114 citizen soldiers ... were spread out over 20 city blocks ... with no contingency or recall plan for a change of mission in place,"" his statement reads.

A relatively small number of guardsmen were in DC on January 6 to assist the city's police force with traffic control in an effort to allow the local authorities to focus on anything related to demonstrations planned in the city. McCarthy's statement underscores the lack of preparedness on the part of the government and federal law enforcement agencies to aggressively respond to a crisis that day, which ultimately saw a violent attack on the Capitol that resulted in the death of five people, including a US Capitol Police officer.

The comments from the former official come the same day acting US Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman told the same committee that the ""department failed to meet its own high standards"" on January 6. Pittman, who apologized on behalf of her department, also told the panel the department was aware of a ""strong potential for violence"" targeting Congress and did not take the appropriate steps to prevent it.

Maj. Gen. William J. Walker, the commanding general of the Washington National Guard, meanwhile, is claiming his authority was restricted by the Department of Defense before the Capitol riot, a move he says prevented his forces from arriving to the attack sooner than they did, The Washington Post reported earlier Tuesday.

Walker told the Post that authority he usually has to dispatch troops in dire situations as well as other powers were stripped from him ahead of the riot. That meant ""he couldn't immediately roll out troops when he received a panicked phone call"" from the US Capitol Police chief warning him that a crowd of then-President Donald Trump's supporters were about to breach the iconic building in an attack.

""All military commanders normally have immediate response authority to protect property, life, and in my case, federal functions -- federal property and life,"" Walker told the Post. ""But in this instance I did not have that authority.""

Asked by the newspaper how quickly his troops could have been able to arrive to the Capitol, which sits near the DC National Guard's headquarters, Walker said: ""With all deliberate speed -- I mean, they're right down the street.""

In the days leading up to the protest, defense officials pulled Walker's ability to deploy the 40-person quick response force (QRF) on his own, requiring instead that he seek the Army secretary's approval. In a letter from McCarthy to the Department of Justice written two days before the riot, he said the QRF could only be deployed as a last resort.

This decision was made in the days before January 6 during the planning for what was expected to be a far less violent protest. If deployed, the QRF was only able to help with traffic control and crowd management, which were the tasks approved for Guardsmen on the street.

Walker's call with former US Capitol Police Chief Steve Sund was at 1:49 p.m. that day, according to an official timeline of events from the defense secretary, which is 15 minutes after the Army secretary spoke to the DC mayor. The DC National Guardsmen who were already on the streets for traffic control were pulled a short time later to refit with riot gear.

On Monday, Walker acknowledged that he does not have the authority to deploy troops on his own, even with a direct request from the mayor's office.

""Since I've been in charge, we've been very responsive to (DC Mayor Muriel Bowser). She provides a request, it comes to me. I conduct mission analysis. I send it to the Secretary of the Army for his approval,"" Walker said, speaking alongside the head of the National Guard Bureau Gen. Daniel Hokanson and acting Army Secretary John Whitley.

Defense officials have acknowledged that the ""overly bureaucratic"" process required to activate and deploy the DC National Guard consumed valuable time as the riot was unfolding on Capitol Hill.

""There's too many people that are involved with the decision, and ultimately no one, one single person responsible,"" McCarthy told CNN last week, adding, ""It makes it very difficult and slow in the response.""

Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied accusations that it denied or delayed the deployment of additional troops as the riot worsened, though McCarthy said the response was hampered by an ""archaic system.""

The comments from Walker add to the already complicated chain of events from January 6, and could face intense scrutiny by Congress during any potential investigations into the attack and the government's preparations ahead of a rally held by Trump that day in which he, along with several others, incited the attack on the Capitol.

Republicans and Democrats see promise and uncertainty in Ohio's open Senate race,"(CNN) The unexpected retirement of Republican Sen. Rob Portman has set off a frantic scramble in Ohio, leading numerous Republicans and a handful of Democratic lawmakers to consider making a run at the now open seat.

The race, beyond being key to control of the Senate, will have significant implications for a state that has been steadily moving to the right for a decade and will speak volumes about the state of each party.

For Republicans, the race represents a chance to further assert their dominance in the onetime battleground , signaling yet again that a state former President Barack Obama won twice is no longer a welcome place for Democrats. But the party is also in a precarious position after the tumultuous departure of former President Donald Trump. A contentious primary for a coveted Senate seat could further exacerbate these deep fissures.

For Democrats, the seat offers a chance to prove that a member of their party not named Sherrod Brown can win a statewide election in the Buckeye State. But the race, alongside one for the governor's mansion in 2022, also threatens to expose the damage that years of Republican victories have done to the Democratic bench in Ohio, a reality that could allow younger talent to test their statewide ability.

""It changes the landscape,"" Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat seen as a top contender for the Senate seat, said of the Portman decision. ""I don't think people are very happy [in Ohio], in terms of their families, their communities and how they feel about their future. And in Ohio, the only people who have been in charge are Republicans. So I think that gives us a great opportunity.""

'These seats don't open up very often'

Republicans have dominated Ohio ever since Obama won the state during his reelection bid in 2012. The party swept statewide office races in 2014. Two years later, Trump carried the state by 8 points while Portman easily beat former Gov. Ted Strickland in his bid for reelection. The party again showed its strength in 2018, electing Mike DeWine to his first term as governor. And last year, Trump once more carried Ohio.

This dominance on both the congressional and statewide level has created a deep bench of Republican office holders, many of whom quickly sprang into action at the chance to run for an open Senate seat.

""These seats don't open up very often,"" said Mike Hartley, a longtime Republican strategiest in Ohio. ""So if you are in any position and have ever wanted to do it, you do it.""

Hartley later joked that when national Republicans called him on Monday to talk about who is thinking about filling the seat, he simply said, ""Every name you could possibly think of.""

The most significant divide in Republicans seeking the job will be between the state's congressional delegation and the statewide elected officials.

At least four members of Ohio's congressional delegation are considering running, but the person seen as the best positioned is Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch conservative with deep ties to Trump. Reps. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup and Mike Turner are also considering bids, people close to the process said.

Because these lawmakers come from reliably Republican districts aided by gerrymandering in the state, they are more conservative than others considering running for the seat, and none more so than Jordan. But the congressional candidates won't clear the field. Multiple statewide elected Republicans in Ohio are considering a run, including Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Secretary of State Frank LaRose.

Unlike Jordan and the other congressional lawmakers, Ohio's statewide elected officials, while conservative, have not been as deeply devoted to Trump and, at times, have been seen as out of step with the Trump base of the party.

Both Husted, who has been an elected official in Ohio since 2001, and LaRose, who served as a Green Beret in Iraq and is a former member of the state Senate, would be seen as more establishment choices, in line with DeWine, who has, at times, been a Trump critic. The two have been critical of Trump in the past, including when Husted was heckled at a Trump rally for urging attendees to put on masks to combat the coronavirus.

""In my humble opinion, it starts with Congressman Jim Jordan,"" said Mike Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life. ""He has an opportunity to be either a king or a king maker.""

The Trump factor will loom large over the race. The former president is so close to Jordan he gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor a president can bestow on a civilian, shortly before he left office. And Trump has been critical of DeWine, especially after the Ohio governor broke with other Republicans to say Biden won the election.

And there is no indication that Trump's grip on the party -- especially on the right -- will weaken over the next two years.

""I live in rural Ohio, 25 miles from the Capitol. There are five Trump signs or flags that remain on my street,"" said Colton Henson, a Republican operative in the state. ""If a candidate thinks there won't be a Trump litmus test for many Republican voters, they may want to rethink strategy.""

Are Democrats still viable in Ohio?

Democrats face a markedly different issue. While the party is largely unified in Ohio, significant losses in the last eight years have diminished the bench of talent in the state and left the party searching for big names who could mount campaigns for statewide office.

""It is a good opportunity to show Democrats can be viable in the state,"" said Aryeh Alex, the executive director of the Ohio House Democratic Caucus.

In order to succeed, however, some Democrats believe the infighting inside the Republican Party needs to continue, hoping it further splits the party ahead of the general election.

""The Republican Party is having such a massive civil war,"" said former Ohio Democratic Party Chair David Pepper. ""They have more of a bench, but the way they have won through gerrymandering has also shaped the politics of their office holders and [the possible candidates] from Congress are much further to the right because they have been living in these gerrymandered districts.""

The two Democrats seen as top candidates for the Senate seat are Whaley and US Rep. Tim Ryan, both of whom said they were considering their options in the wake of the Portman news. But the list of candidates does not stop there.

Danny O'Connor, the county recorder in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, told CNN he is considering mounting a campaign. Some Democrats are looking to recruit Dr. Amy Acton, who rose to prominence as DeWine's public health director as the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Other Democrats have looked at Emilia Sykes, the young, Black minority leader of the Ohio House of Representatives, as someone who could mount a historic campaign and motivate Democrats.

For Ohio Democrats, the model for someone who can win statewide is Brown, the populist senator who, despite being an avowed liberal, has found success in the state by relating to both independents and Republicans. While that legacy has led some in the state to believe nominating candidates like Brown is the surest way to win, the last decade has demonstrated that his appeal is not only unique, but also difficult to replicate.

""I'm considering this because Ohioans have been left behind time and time again,"" said O'Connor. ""I'm from a small town that gets smaller every year. I know the decency of our people but also that our niceness isn't going to put food on the table. We need someone who will fight, scrap and claw for every worker who hasn't had a pay raise or is looking for work.""

Other possible candidates argued that trying to be Brown is what Ohio Democrats have done for the past decade -- and it hasn't worked.

""One thing that we have an opportunity to do is show that with diverse candidates, with women and people of color, there is a pathway to win,"" said Sykes, who told CNN she is considering a bid. ""What we are learning is that when you put women on the ballot, women win. When you put people of color on the ballot, we win.""

Sykes pointed to Melody Stewart, a Black Democrat who won a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court in 2018.

Whaley made a similar case, too, noting that many of the Democratic losses over the last decade have come when Democrats put up White male candidates.

""We don't need to be insane as a party,"" she said. ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Certainly, trying something new would be good after decades of trying things the other way.""

And while almost all Democrats argued that the path to victory comes through organizing the base and creating excitement, people like Shannon Hardin, the president of the Columbus City Council, backed up Sykes and Whaley.

""We have to get real organizing and real voter registration efforts in urban communities and in some of our rural areas,"" said Hardin. ""A Black man, middle named Hussein, last name Obama, won this state in 2012. It is still right, we have a lot of work to do, we have some cultural hills to climb here, but I think with the right candidate and that message on the working class, I think we have a real shot at this thing."""
Sen. Patrick Leahy home from brief hospitalization after presiding over opening of Trump's impeachment trial,"(CNN) Sen. Patrick Leahy returned home Tuesday night from the hospital after seeking treatment out of an abundance of caution, according to a spokesman.

Leahy had been hospitalized just hours after presiding over the opening of former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. A spokesman said he was not feeling well and the Capitol physician recommended he go to a local hospital.

""The Capitol Physician suggested that Senator Leahy go to George Washington University Hospital this evening for observation, out of an abundance of caution,"" spokesman David Carle said in a statement. ""After getting test results back, and after a thorough examination, Senator Leahy now is home. He looks forward to getting back to work. Patrick and Marcelle deeply appreciate the well wishes they have received tonight.

As the Senate president pro tempore -- the longest-serving senator of the majority party -- the 80-year-old Vermont Democrat is presiding over Trump's impeachment trial in lieu of Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts, who oversaw Trump's first impeachment trial, chose not to oversee the proceedings because Trump is no longer in office, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Sen. Dick Durbin, the second highest-ranking Senate Democrat, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer earlier on Tuesday evening that Leahy could be back in the chamber Wednesday.

A rise in student suicides has pushed the 5th largest US school district to speed up a return to in-person learning,"(CNN) The fifth-largest district in the United States is expediting its plan to bring students back for in-person learning after a rise in student suicides.

Nevada's Clark County School District, which has more than 326,000 students enrolled, has been fully remote since March 2020 -- when the Covid-19 pandemic began. In the nine months since March, there have been 19 student suicides in the district, a school official confirmed to CNN. In the year before, there were only nine.

The district did not give evidence of a direct link between the deaths and remote learning. However, six students died by suicide between March 16 and June 30, and 12 students died between July 1 and December 31. There was one more death earlier this month, a district official confirmed to CNN on Monday.

Citing in part social and emotional wellness, the Clark County Board of Trustees voted unanimously to start bringing students back for in-person learning at a meeting on January 14.

""The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be very challenging for education,"" said Superintendent Dr. Jesus Jara. ""We will continue to make the health and safety of students and staff a top priority. As we continue to look at the academic and health crisis that the pandemic has caused, I believe that the plan proposed provides the first steps in returning our students and educators to the classroom."""
Microsoft posts record revenue as pandemic continues to fuel sales,"New York (CNN Business) Microsoft exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations for quarterly revenue by nearly $3 billion and hit a three-month sales record, it reported Tuesday.

The results signal that the pandemic is continuing to buoy the tech giant's business — from computers and gaming systems to the cloud computing systems helping companies navigate continued remote working.

Microsoft MSFT posted $43.1 billion in revenue for its fiscal second quarter — a 17% increase from the same period in the prior year and well above the $40.2 billion analysts had predicted. Income hit $15.5 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with the $1.64 earnings per share Wall Street predicted.

The company's stock shot up as much as 6% in after-hours trading immediately following the report. About two hours after the report, shares were up just over 3%.

""What we have witnessed over the past year is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. ""Microsoft is powering this shift with the world's largest and most comprehensive cloud platform.""

"SpaceX, Amazon spat pits world's richest men against each other over space real estate","Austin, Texas (CNN Business) SpaceX and Amazon (AMZN) — companies run by the two richest men in the world — are sparring over their competing satellite-based internet businesses, with SpaceX accusing Amazon of ""stifling competition"" and Amazon accusing SpaceX of looking to ""smother competition in the cradle.""

Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, has an estimated net worth of $209 billion. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, has an estimated net worth of $192 billion. (By comparison, even the lower figure was higher than the annual gross domestic product of more than half the countries in the world in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.)

At the center of the back-and-forth is a recent attempt by SpaceX to modify its license for Starlink, a massive constellation of internet satellites, of which SpaceX has already launched more than 900. SpaceX already has permission from the US federal government to launch thousands of satellites to bulk up the Starlink constellation, and in recent filings with the Federal Communications Commission, SpaceX said it wants to put a few thousand of those satellites in a lower altitude than previously planned or authorized.

That proposed change could put Starlink satellites in the way of another constellation, called Project Kuiper, that's been proposed by Amazon. The company has not yet launched any satellites, but it has secured an FCC license for the project.

Amazon's current plans include putting some of its satellites into orbit roughly 590 km (or about 366 miles) above the Earth's surface. The changes to its license that SpaceX is advocating for would allow the company to orbit nearly 3,000 of its satellites at an altitude of between 540 and 570 km (336 to 354 miles), which Amazon argues is too close for comfort. The company argued in its objection that Starlink satellites at that altitude could cause more signal interferences with Project Kuiper satellites and other nearby satellite networks.

Democrats signal they could take next steps on Covid relief package as soon as next week,"(CNN) Democrats are swiftly moving to unlock an arcane Senate budget process to pass a Covid-19 relief bill with just Democratic votes even as the Biden administration continues their outreach to Republican senators to make the bill bipartisan.

Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Tuesday that the Senate could move as soon as next week to pass a budget resolution. That would be a first step in beginning the process to write a bill that would include Democratic priorities and could pass the Senate with just 51 votes.

""In keeping our options open, on our caucus call today, I informed senators to be prepared that a vote on a budget resolution could come as early as next week,"" Schumer said.

Still, passing a budget resolution is just the first step in what is known as reconciliation, a specific and technical Senate budget process that allows passage of some legislation with just a simple majority. A vote on the resolution, which could bypass committee, according to multiple aides, would then allow the Senate to give a committee specific instructions to craft the language of the relief proposal. After that, the legislation would have to undergo a rigorous review process by the Senate parliamentarian who would decide if each provision in the bill met the rules required under reconciliation.

Democrats have argued that moving ahead with the budget resolution is hardly a sign that they are giving up on bipartisan talks, but they argue they need to kickstart that process now in case those bipartisan talks falter.

Harris reflects on 'full circle' moment after receiving vaccine dose at NIH building her late mother frequented,"Washington (CNN) Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday spoke in personal terms about a ""full circle"" moment after receiving the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at the same National Institutes of Health building her late mother had frequented for work.

""I have the luxury of being here at this moment on just the fifth day of our administration -- coming full circle because, you see, NIH was such a huge part of my youth as this place that my mother went all the time and was very excited to work,"" Harris recalled moments after receiving her shot.

Harris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a breast cancer researcher who had ""two goals in her life,"" the vice president said: ""To raise her two daughters and end breast cancer. In fact, little-known fact, my first job was cleaning pipettes in my mother's lab.""

Gopalan, who raised her daughters as a single mother, died in 2009. Harris has frequently recalled her mother's profound influence on her life both in and out of politics. After she became the first Black and South Asian woman nominated to a major party's presidential ticket this summer, Harris said, ""I know she's looking down on me from above.""

Turning to NIH employees Tuesday as she reflected on her mother's passion for science, Harris added: ""The importance of NIH is that this is about an essential function of government, which is to provide for the public health.""

"In-person learning during the pandemic is possible with the right precautions, CDC researchers say","(CNN) Many parents and caregivers remain worried about the safety of their children in schools amid the coronavirus pandemic, but experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that with the right mitigation measures, there is a path to low-risk, in-person learning.

Experts have stressed the importance of in-person learning for students' development and access to essential services. On the other hand, Covid-19 case, hospitalization and death rates remain high across the nation.

In an effort to strike the right balance, schools have adopted varying approaches that include in-person learning, online learning and a hybrid of the two.

In a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Tuesday, CDC researchers noted that the kind of spread seen in crowded offices and long-term care facilities has not been reported in schools. In-school transmission has occurred, but the researchers said there is little evidence that it contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.

""Committing today to policies that prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in communities and in schools will help ensure the future social and academic welfare of all students and their education,"" the researchers wrote in the JAMA paper.

""Consistent with this longstanding principle of making individualized assessments in criminal cases, I am rescinding -- effective immediately -- the policy directive,"" acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson said in a memo to federal prosecutors.

""While policies may change, our mission always remains the same: to seek justice under the law,"" Wilkinson added.

California revamps Covid-19 vaccine delivery system amid criticism over slow rollout,"(CNN) California is revamping its coronavirus vaccine delivery system amid criticism over the slow and inefficient rollout of doses, the California Department of Public Health announced Tuesday.

The new system aims to simplify eligibility, standardize information and data, and address the available supply of doses by streamlining the process, the department said.

California has been hit hard by the pandemic.

""While vaccines remain extremely limited, the goal is to build a system to equitably and efficiently administer vaccines when supply increases,"" officials said in a statement.

Thus far, 2.6 million doses have been administered in the state, which has a population of about 39 million.

Biden announces purchase of 200M vaccine doses,"(CNN) President Joe Biden announced a series of measures on Tuesday aimed at ramping up coronavirus vaccine allocation and distribution, including the purchase of 200 million more vaccine doses and increased distribution to states by millions of doses next week.

With those additional doses, Biden said there would be enough to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans -- nearly the entire US population -- by the end of summer or early fall.

He described efforts to combat Covid-19 as a ""wartime undertaking.""

""We now have a national strategy to beat Covid-19. It's comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial, and it is detailed,"" he said.

As part of the new efforts announced Tuesday, the US will buy 100 million more doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 100 million more from Moderna -- the two-dose vaccines that have been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration. Pfizer and Moderna are working to step up production, and Biden said that the additional doses will be available this summer."

Vice President Kamala Harris just received her second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.

""So I've had the vaccine, and it really was painless, relatively painless. But I want to thank everyone here at NIH for all you do,"" Harris said after she received the shot. Harris' husband Doug Emhoff will also receive a shot today.

Harris went on to deliver brief remarks and shared her personal connection to NIH. As NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins stood on stage with her, she said that her mother would travel to the NIH offices in Bethesda, and was a peer reviewer in the biochemical endocrinology study section.

""My mother had two goals in her life, to raise her two daughters and end breast cancer,"" Harris said.

The vice president praised the efforts of NIH and their scientists, saying that the work that they do to improve public health is an ""essential part of government.""

""The importance of NIH is that this is about an essential function of government, which is to provide for the public health. The work that happens here has one goal, to improve public health. And the importance of the pursuit of the work that happens at NIH, is that it's not about profit. It's about the people,"" Harris said."
Judge temporarily blocks Biden's plan to halt deportations,"(CNN) A federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the Biden administration's pause on deportations Tuesday, delivering a blow to one of the administration's first immigration actions.

The early defeat, even if temporary, demonstrates the limits of President Joe Biden's executive actions, which are expected to be challenged in court.

Tuesday's order stems from a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenging the 100-day pause on deportations, which took effect Friday. The complaint cited in part an agreement signed between the Department of Homeland Security and Texas in the waning days of the Trump presidency that required the department to consult the state before changing or modifying policies.

Judge Drew Tipton of the Southern District of Texas, however, said the temporary restraining order was appropriate under the Administrative Procedure Act. Tipton blocked the Biden administration from executing its deportation pause for 14 days.

Tipton, appointed by President Donald Trump, also found that Texas could be harmed if the moratorium were to continue. ""In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the threat of injury to Texas outweighs any potential harm to Defendants and the public interest is served and protected by the issuance of this TRO,"" he wrote.

The moratorium has only been in place for five days.

The White House, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately comment on the ruling.

Paxton applauded the ruling, saying in a statement: ""The Court's decision to stop the Biden Administration from casting aside congressionally enacted immigration laws is a much-needed remedy for DHS's unlawful action. A near-complete suspension of deportations would only serve to endanger Texans and undermine federal law.""

Biden's first days in office have been marked by the release of his ambitious immigration agenda, but the ruling has whiplashed immigration attorneys, who just days earlier were trying to make sense of the new memo.

""In a word: unbelievable. Despite the limited nature of the TRO grant (a two week pause of the pause), the decision is breathtakingly wrong,"" said Jeremy McKinney, an immigration attorney based in North Carolina and the American Immigration Lawyers Association first vice president.

""There have been so many changes, and so many rules, and there's also Covid-19 and as a way to kind of bring some order into this chaos that the Trump administration had wrought, I think a pause on removals would've been a good policy,"" said Claudia Cubas, an immigration attorney based in Washington, DC.

The Biden moratorium covers most deportations but excludes individuals who came to the US after November 1, are suspected of terrorism or espionage or pose a danger to national security, have waived rights to remain in the US or who've been determined removable by the acting director, according to an agency memo.

Immediate lawsuit from Texas

Just as swiftly as the new memo took effect, so came a legal challenge from Paxton.

The Republican led an attempt to void Biden's Electoral College victory last month and will be a constant presence in federal court attempting to block the Biden administration's policies on immigration.

During the Trump administration, Paxton also led a lawsuit challenging the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation. The case is ongoing. He is also at the head of the latest lawsuit at the Supreme Court challenging the Affordable Care Act.

The case over the deportation pause has moved quickly.

On Monday, Tipton asked the Biden administration to clarify its moratorium after Texas submitted a Fox News report to the court that cited an internal email instructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to ""release them all, immediately.""

The Justice Department submitted the correspondence , which originated in the Houston field office, on Monday afternoon. An official appears to notify the workforce about the moratorium announced the previous day, telling them to ""stop all removals"" as of midnight, but that email is later followed by another official calling for the directive to be retracted immediately.

""Please direct your supervisors to follow the memorandum issued. Operational guidance is being developed and will be issued in the coming days,"" the email stated, adding: ""Any questions on removals, releases, and/or arrests that we cannot determine fit squarely into the directive will be forwarded up through me to HQ for further discussion and decisions.""

The Justice Department also told the court that some undocumented immigrants with removal orders had been released from custody, but as part of separate litigation relating to Covid-19. DHS has discretion in who it releases, the Justice Department added.

""There are going to be times that the Department of Homeland Security uses its discretion in manners that Texas disagrees... Texas has different views about immigration policy than the current administration,"" said DOJ attorney Adam Kirschner.

The Justice Department is likely to appeal the ruling.

Democrats introduce bill to raise minimum wage to $15 by 2025,"(CNN) Seeking to fulfill a long-standing Democratic ambition, a coalition of lawmakers introduced a bill on Tuesday that would raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.

The measure, which is also included in President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package , calls for gradually increasingthe hourly wage in increments until it hits $15 in 2025. After that, it would be indexed to median wage growth-- a move meant to guarantee wages keep up with inflation without needing new legislation.

Democratic lawmakers have pushed for years to raise the minimum wage, which now stands at $7.25 and hasn't been increased since 2009.

President Barack Obama pressed in his 2013 State of the Union address to bump up the hourly rate in stages to $9 an hour over two years, and state and local governments around the country have done just that. Voters have consistently approved even bigger minimum wage hikes when they appear on the ballot -- most recently in Florida, where voters supported a $15 minimum wage in November.

But the legislative drive has stalled in Congress, where Democrats were in the minority in either the House or Senate, or both, from 2010 until this year.

Now, with narrow majorities in both chambers and Biden in the White House, Democrats are renewing the push.

Initially, Democratic leaders have said they will seek to pass the measure with at least some Republican support.

Failing that, they will need to either end the Senate's legislative filibuster -- which requires 60 votes for a bill to get an up-or-down vote -- or use budget reconciliation, an arcane but frequently used process that allows legislation that affects the federal deficit to be enacted with a simple majority. If Democrats go that route, they could not afford to lose a single vote.

How it could pass

""If we cannot get enough Republicans to vote for this legislation under regular order, we cannot simply take no for an answer,"" Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday. ""We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, either through budget reconciliation, by a simple majority vote in the Senate. And as the incoming chair of the Senate budget committee, that is exactly what I will be fighting to do.""

Asked how a raise to the minimum wage would qualify under the reconciliation rules, a question that has been a point of outside contention, Sanders and others pointed to the law's potential knock-on effects. Specifically, he argued that many workers currently depending on some forms of federal assistance would no longer need it, which would reduce government spending and ""have a very positive impact on the federal deficit.""

Sanders also expressed confidence that the bill, with 38 Democratic co-sponsors in the Senate, would garner enough votes to pass through the simple majority, reconciliation process.

The Vermont independent first introduced a $15 minimum wage proposal in 2015 and then reintroduced with Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray in 2017 and 2019. The House passed a bill to do in 2019, but it did not make it through the Senate.

A long battle

The so-called Fight for $15 dates back to 2012, when fast-food workers walked off the job in New York City to call attention to their battle for higher pay.

growing number of companies, including Backed heavily by unions and consumer advocates, the effort has succeeded in eight states and more than 40 cities , which have adopted laws to raise their minimum wage to $15. Agrowing number of companies, including Amazon and Target , agreed to lift their minimum wage to that level in recent years as unemployment fell to historic lows -- before the pandemic struck.

But the movement to raise the minimum wage -- by any amount -- has faced steep opposition from Republicans and businesses, particularly restaurants and other smaller employers, who often operate on tight profit margins. They argue that boosting wages will force them to lay off workers.

The economic impact of a higher wage has been hotly debated among economists for years, with left-leaning experts countering that increasing salaries will allow workers to spend more and lift businesses and the economy.

Since 1968, the minimum wage has lost more than 30% of its purchasing power, according to a fact sheet distributed by lawmakers.

Sanders has been a longtime proponent of boosting the wage , saying no full-time worker in the US should be unable to afford to feed their families or pay the rent. He has slammed companies for paying wages that are so low that their workers need federal assistance, including food stamps.

""The $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage,"" said Sanders, who introduced the bill Tuesday along with Washington Sen. Patty Murray and Reps. Bobby Scott of Virginia, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Stephanie Murphy of Florida. ""In the United States of America, a job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it.""

The legislation would raise the wages of nearly 32 million workers, more than half of whom are essential workers, according to Scott, citing legislation from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.

It would increase wages for one-third of all Black workers and one-quarter of Hispanic workers. Also, nearly 60% of those helped would be women.

""The minimum wage today is one of the clearest examples of how weak labor standards can impose constant unrelenting hardship on millions of workers and their families,"" said Scott, noting one in nine full-time, year-round workers is paid a wage that leaves them in poverty.

The coronavirus pandemic has shined a light on the financial struggles of low-wage Americans, many of whom are essential workers and have been hit hard by the outbreak. Those making the minimum wage are typically younger and work in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has suffered from steep job losses amid state lockdowns since the pandemic began.

Support in the White House

The shift in control of the agenda in Washington has quickly moved what was, in effect, a bill meant to signal Democratic intentions into the realm of the possible.

""Last session, the people's house, with Chairman Scott and Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi in the leadership passed the 'Raise the Wage Act' and we're ready to do it again,"" Jayapal said, before noting what has changed. ""And now, we have a President Biden who believes that we should pass a $15 minimum wage and a Senate led by Democrats ready to work for the people.""

Both Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the renewed effort.

for federal workers and contractors, signing last week that begins laying the groundwork to do so. Biden has already started taking steps toward instituting a $15 minimum wagefor federal workers and contractors, signing an executive order last week that begins laying the groundwork to do so.

""We have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week -- working -- and some with two jobs, and they're still below the poverty line,"" Biden said Friday.

The legislation also calls for gradually phasing out the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, youth employees and workers with disabilities."
Covid-19: 100 million coronavirus cases now confirmed worldwide,"(CNN) The world has now surpassed 100 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus . It's a figure that seemed almost unimaginable 12 months ago , when the first case had only just been confirmed on US soil.

A year later, the pandemic shows little sign of loosening its stranglehold on billions of people's everyday lives. Cases continue to rise sharply in some parts of the world, and every day the losses mount, as more people lose loved ones to Covid-19, lose a business or lose their livelihood.

On January 15, the official global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surpassed 2 million, according to Johns Hopkins University.

While the 2 million figure is horrifying, experts say the real death toll is likely much higher. Only confirmed Covid-19 deaths are included in the tally, which means that people who die without a firm diagnosis may not be included.

Similarly, many people will have been infected with the coronavirus without having a positive test to confirm it. In the early stages of the pandemic fewer tests were available, and testing remains inadequate in many countries now.

Nonetheless, with a world population of some 7.67 billion, according to the latest World Bank figures, the global case tally suggests that about one in every 76 people has now had the virus.

Despite countries imposing measures ranging from travel bans to school closures to full national lockdowns, the coronavirus has continued its inexorable spread, reaching every continent by December and leaving a trail of financial hardship, struggling hospitals and heartbreak in its wake.

The world passed the threshold of 1 million confirmed cases on April 2, and 10 million on June 28, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

It took until November 7 for the world to register 50 million confirmed cases. Since then, the trend has accelerated sharply. The 90 million case mark was passed less than three weeks ago, on January 10.

Almost a quarter of the 100 million cases reported so far have occurred in the United States, data from Johns Hopkins University shows. And more than 400,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the US, a tragic milestone reached on the last full day of Donald Trump's presidency.

The second-worst affected country in terms of overall case numbers, India, accounts for just over one-tenth of the global confirmed cases. There have been more than 152,000 deaths there, according to Johns Hopkins.

Brazil has reported more than 8.8 million confirmed cases of the virus and 217,000 deaths, the second highest death toll after the United States.

Europe has also been badly hit and many countries have been battling to contain a second wave of infections since the fall. The United Kingdom has fared worst, with more than 3.6 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths -- the fifth highest toll in the world.

Excess mortality figures released by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, indicate that around 297,500 more deaths occurred in the EU between March and October 2020 compared with the same period in 2016 to 2019.

As governments around the world seek to limit further spread of the virus, the emergence of new, more infectious variants is causing great concern to scientists.

One such variant was first detected in southeast England late last year; another has been detected in South Africa and two more in Brazil. A variation has also been seen in the US state of California that may or may not be driving renewed spread there.

The B.1.1.7 variant first seen in Britain has now been found in at least 60 countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned earlier this month it could worsen the spread of the pandemic.

Scientists have been racing to see whether the changes in the virus will make it as susceptible to available treatments and vaccines, amid fears that the mutations will allow them to evade some of the immunity induced by vaccination.

Research released this week provided some reassuring evidence that despite those mutations, people vaccinated against Covid-19 will be protected against the emerging new variants.

Mass Covid-19 vaccination programs seem to offer the fastest path out of the pandemic -- but countries' access to vaccine supply and the capacity to distribute and administer jabs varies greatly.

Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, the US, Denmark and the UK have led the way in the rate of doses administered per 100 people, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University. But some countries have yet to start rolling out inoculations

In the US, President Joe Biden has set a target of administering 100 million doses of vaccine in his first 100 days in office. More than 17.5 million doses had been administered across the country as of Thursday, a day after he was sworn in.

Infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said that despite challenges with the distribution and administration of vaccines, the US ""can and should"" vaccinate 70-85% of US adults by the end of summer, which could mean a semblance of normality by the fall.

In the UK, the government aims to give everyone in the most vulnerable groups at least a first dose by mid-February, and to have vaccinated all adults by the fall.

Meanwhile, all those globally who are not vaccinated must continue to rely on the social distancing, hygiene and mask-wearing measures that have become all too familiar since Covid-19 arrived on the scene.

No one knows how many tens of millions more people worldwide will be infected with the coronavirus -- or how many millions more will die -- before this pandemic is brought under control.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 500 million people, or one third of the world's population at the time, became infected during the 1918 influenza pandemic . That virus caused at least 50 million deaths, of which about 675,000 were in the United States, the CDC says.

In 2021, hopes remain high that science and modern medicine can prevail against Covid-19 with a fraction of that death toll."
Blinken becomes Biden's top diplomat after a friendship forged over decades,"Washington (CNN) It was February 2008 when a snowstorm suddenly overwhelmed the flight path of two American helicopters, forcing them to make an unexpected landing on a mountaintop in Afghanistan.

On board the aircrafts overlooking Taliban territory were Joe Biden and Antony Blinken , his then-top adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with a few other members of the committee, according to two sources on the trip.

When the helicopters landed, soldiers accompanying them established a perimeter around the narrow mountain peak while they decided what to do next. Blinken hopped out of his helicopter to check on Biden.

The source on the trip told CNN that they ""remember Tony being unbelievably calm throughout the entire thing and occasionally quite funny. He did not blame anyone for what had happened.""

""Tony just knew how to keep everything under control. He mirrors Biden in that way. They are both calm under pressure,"" they said.

Blinken, the newly confirmed secretary of state , has worked with Biden for almost 20 years, and many describe him as having the closest personal relationship with the President of anybody in the Cabinet. They forged that bond in the field, on a tremendous number of foreign trips they took together when Biden was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but also through a US presidential campaign, the shared experience of personal loss and ties between their families.

Over the years, Biden has relied on Blinken to deal with crisis scenarios in an even-keeled manner, to morph his foreign policy ideas into reality, to support his political endeavors, and to be a loyal friend.

""Tony has been a part of Joe's evolution, learning, and changes as he has confronted challenge after challenge over decades,"" said Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on the foreign relations committee and called Blinken ""an irreplaceable part of Joe Biden's inner core team.""

Expected to be privy to all major decisions

Blinken is expected to be privy to every major decision Biden makes as President, according to multiple sources who spoke with CNN. That deep level of involvement will be driven by Biden administration's belief that foreign policy is intrinsically tied to domestic policy and the need to strengthen democracy at home, but it is also a reflection of their sturdy comfortable relationship, the sources explained.

""They will continue to nurture their relationship, and it will be wide ranging,"" said an official who is planning to join Blinken's State Department. ""They will see each other a lot. And some of it may be over casual dinners at the White House.""

When Blinken began working with Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2002, the Iraq War debate was ongoing, accelerating their relationship, which may have otherwise matured at a slower pace.

""The war drums were beating,"" said a source who was working on the committee at the time. ""The relationship forged pretty quickly.""

Blinken worked alongside Biden when he voted in favor the Iraq War -- a vote that has been repeatedly scrutinized, and one that Biden and Blinken have both said Biden regretted.

After that initial bonding experience over the most fundamental foreign policy question of war and peace, Blinken was involved in almost every foreign policy declaration or policy that Biden put forth during his time in the Senate and as vice president.

Even when Biden went against the grain -- for example, in advocating for a smaller troop presence in Afghanistan when other national security officials advocated for a troop surge in the early days of the Obama administration -- Blinken advocated for his views at the interagency level and fine-tuned the policy Biden was driving it forth.

""Blinken channels Biden's passion and energy into a constructive outcome,"" said the source on the Afghanistan trip.

""It was Biden's style to absorb information and give feedback extemporaneously, in the moment, which does not lead to a crisp foreign policy paper,"" said the source who worked on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with them. ""But Blinken is skilled in communications and writing. He could do it.""

Blinken's tight-knit relationship with Biden is what career diplomats and those close to Blinken's inner circle expect to fuel his efficacy as America's top diplomat.

""The challenge always with the secretary of state and the president is does the secretary of state really speak for the president? And when he says something, does the foreign government that he's talking to believe that that is what the president actually thinks?,"" former career US diplomat Lew Lukens told CNN. ""When Tony Blinken travels the world, people will know what he says is what Joe Biden believes and thinks. He speaks for the President, and that is incredibly important for a secretary of state. And we didn't always have that.""

Involvement in Biden's political career

Blinken has not solely been a foreign policy adviser to Biden, he has also been intimately involved in aspects of Biden's political career.

In 2008, the night Biden got home from being announced in Springfield as Barack Obama's running mate, he had a couple staffers up from Washington to his home to plan. Blinken was one of just four, explained a source who worked with them on the campaign. After that, he went on the road with Biden as he traveled the country campaigning.

""Truthfully, almost all of the messaging and speeches day in and day out were about domestic issues, not foreign policy. But Sen. Biden wanted Tony there by his side because he knew the presidency was always shaped by foreign policy decisions, and he wanted uninterrupted time with Tony to plan. But he also wanted something else: a friend and trusted confidante,"" said the source who worked with them on the 2008 campaign. ""As many of us on the plane were falling asleep, you could usually see a light on up in the front two seats, and it was Sen. Biden and Tony talking late into the night.""

And there is another layer that deepens the connection: Blinken's wife, Evan Ryan, was Biden's deputy campaign manager when he ran for the nomination in 2008. After working on the Biden transition, Ryan is now serving in the Biden White House as the executive secretary.

The two couples have been loyal friends throughout times of hardship when they have experienced family loss, according to sources familiar with their relationship. Biden's father died in September of 2002 when he first met Blinken, and then in 2015, Blinken's stepfather and Biden's son, Beau Biden, both passed away.

""President Biden is personally close to both Tony Blinken and Evan Ryan and Tony has been an incredibly loyal, capable and effective adviser, staffer and personal friend of the sort that is rare in Washington,"" said Coons."
'It's time to act': Biden moves to address racial inequity,"(CNN) President Joe Biden signed a series of executive actions revolving around racial equity policy on Tuesday, focusing on nondiscrimination policy, prison reform and public housing, saying it is ""time to act.""

""It's what the core values of this nation call us to do. And I believe the vast majority of Americans -- Democrats, Republicans and independents -- share these values and want us to act as well,"" Biden said during a signing ceremony at the White House alongside Vice President Kamala Harris. ""We have never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation, to state the obvious, that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives.""

He added that ""it's time to act now not only because it's the right thing to do, but because if we do, we'll all be better off for it.""

Biden also credited protests over the death of George Floyd as having ""stirred the conscious of tens of millions of Americans, and ... marked a turning point in this country's attitude toward racial justice.""

As part of Tuesday's executive actions, the President directed the Justice Department not to renew federal contracts with private prisons. Biden had campaigned on eliminating the federal government's use of private prisons.

Biden established that it is the policy of his administration to condemn and denounce anti-Asian bias, specifically addressing anti-Asian bias in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The President will be working with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice on the matter.

Biden issued a memorandum to the Department of Housing and Urban Development he said will ""redress historical racism in federal housing policies."" He also took steps on Tuesday to reaffirm the federal government's commitment to tribal sovereignty and consultation.

The President indicated during the signing ceremony that while previous presidential administrations have had interest in addressing equity, his administration intends to integrate racial equity policy holistically across its domestic policy efforts.

A senior administration official said on a call with reporters earlier Tuesday that cost implications of the move away from private prison was not a ""motivating factor.""

""The motivating factor, however, was the fact that private prisons are not only encouraged profiteering off of human lives but more importantly, I've been shown by the Department of Justice inspector general's report to be subpar in terms of safety and security for those incarcerated,"" the official said.

The housing memorandum will ""make clear we have to acknowledge the role that the federal government has played through much of the 20th century and implementing discriminatory housing policies across the United States from redlining to mortgage discrimination, to destructive federal highway construction to redress this history,"" the official said.

Reporters were also told by the official that ""the President has asked (the Office of Management and Budget) to examine opportunities to embed racial equity in its work(.)""

Biden has specifically asked the office, which plays a role in crafting the administration's annual budget proposals, to evaluate opportunities to allocate funding ""more equitably to target groups who have been underserved or harmed by federal investments in the past"" in its annual budget submission, the official said.

Tuesday's executive actions are the first among more Biden administration initiatives related to equity -- including supporting future legislation in Congress.

An earlier draft of Tuesday's plans indicated that the President was going to issue an executive order creating a policing commission, something he promised he'd create if elected to office. It also indicated that Biden would sign an order to reinstate an Obama-era policy barring the transfer of military equipment to local police departments.

White House domestic policy adviser Susan Rice indicated during a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon that policing and criminal justice reform initiatives will be addressed in the coming weeks.

Biden's voting history in Congress on criminal justice and prison reform issues had an impact on his presidential campaign. And Tuesday's actions, coming less than a week into his presidency, seem to be an apparent attempt to correct what he has admitted was one of his shortcomings.

""You know I've been in this fight for a long time. It goes not just to voting rights. It goes to the criminal justice system,"" Biden said on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2019 . ""I haven't always been right. I know we haven't always gotten things right, but I've always tried.""

Biden helped draft the 1994 crime bill, which set strict federal sentencing standards and which critics argue led to an era of mass incarceration.

In a 1993 Senate floor speech speaking in favor of the crime bill, Biden warned of ""predators on our streets.""

""We have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created,"" Biden said. ""They are beyond the pale many of those people, beyond the pale,"" Biden continued. ""And it's a sad commentary on society. We have no choice but to take them out of society.""

Biden's vice president, who was once his 2020 presidential race opponent, said in 2019 that she believed the bill caused mass incarceration.

Then-California Sen. Kamala Harris said she disagreed with Biden, who had said at the time that the crime bill ""did not generate mass incarceration.""

""That crime bill -- that 1994 crime bill -- it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country. It encouraged and was the first time that we had a federal three strikes law. It funded the building of more prisons in the states. So, I disagree, sadly,"" Harris said.

Biden also expressed unequivocal support, in both 1994 and in the years following, for the law's billions in funding to build state prisons, including in his home state of Delaware. He argued in 1994 that the law should include less money for prison construction than Republicans wanted to spend -- but he emphasized that he too wanted to spend billions.

He was also a longtime proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure while serving as a senator, which critics have said would have made investigating police officers for misconduct more difficult.

Senators sworn in for Trump impeachment trial,"(CNN) Senators were sworn in for the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump on Tuesday amid an immediate challenge to the constitutionality of the trial from a Republican ally of the former President.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky forced a procedural vote on the constitutionality of the trial Tuesday afternoon, in what amounted to the first test of how Senate Republicans view the upcoming trial, the substance of which will begin with arguments next month. The Senate voted to table, or kill, Paul's point of order, 55 to 45, with just five Republicans joining Democrats to vote against dismissing the trial.

The five Republicans who voted against Paul were Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.

The Kentucky Republican said Tuesday that he forced the procedural vote to show there already aren't sufficient votes to convict Trump, which would require two-thirds of senators. Many Republicans have taken the position in recent days that the trial is not constitutional because Trump is no longer President, in what's become the most common argument to acquit Trump.

""I think it showed that impeachment is dead on arrival,"" Paul said after the vote. ""If you voted it was unconstitutional, how in the world would you ever vote to convict somebody for this?""

Tuesday's test vote showed that it's likely next-to-impossible for Democrats to find 17 Republican votes for the two-thirds needed to convict and bar Trump from running for office again. Several Republicans said they were surprised Tuesday they were already taking a vote on the constitutionality of the trial, as the question is something that both the House impeachment managers and Trump's legal team are likely to address in their presentations next month.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said he's going into the trial with an open mind about Trump's guilt, voted with Paul on Tuesday, suggesting he has constitutional concerns about the trial.

The trial began Tuesday afternoon with the swearing in of Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont, the Senate president pro tempore, who will preside over the trial. Leahy then swore in the rest of the Senate, and senators went four at a time to sign an ""oath book"" as jurors for the trial.

David Carle, a spokesman for Leahy, said Tuesday evening that the senator was not feeling well after performing his duties and was taken to a local hospital.

""This evening, Senator Leahy was in his Capitol office and was not feeling well. He was examined in the Capitol by the Attending Physician,"" Carle said in a statement. ""Out of an abundance of caution, the Attending Physician recommended that he be taken to a local hospital for observation, where he is now, and where he is being evaluated.""

The Senate passed its pre-trial organizing resolution, laying out the rules heading into the trial, 83-17, before the Senate adjourned as a ""court of impeachment"" until February 9, when the trial arguments are scheduled to begin.

Republicans focus on constitutionality question

At their party lunch Tuesday ahead of Paul's planned vote, Senate Republicans hosted conservative legal scholar Jonathan Turley, one of the lead scholars arguing that impeaching Trump when he is out of office is unconstitutional.

Turley has written extensively in recent days about his belief that while reasonable people can disagree about whether or not it is constitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a former President, he wrote recently on his blog, ""even if the Senate does not view this as extraconstitutional, it should view this trial as Constitutionally unsound.""

Given the limited language in the Constitution on impeachment, legal experts disagree about whether the Senate can convict a former president. But Democrats have pointed to legal scholars on both ends of the political spectrum who say a trial is constitutional, because the Senate has held trials previously for former officials.

Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, charged that Republicans were fixated on the constitutional issue because ""they don't want to be held accountable for President Trump's incitement of a mob to attack the United States Capitol.""

""They don't want to be held accountable on that vote so they're going to try to make it another argument that is all about the Constitution,"" Durbin said.

Several Senate Republicans say they agree it's constitutional, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who said her review ""has led me to conclude that it is constitutional, in recognizing that impeachment is not solely about removing a president, it is also a matter of political consequence.""

Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who just won reelection, said Tuesday, ""I think there's probably a constitutional basis for it.""

""I have more problem with the process and the expedited nature of it,"" he added.

Several Republicans have pointed to the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding over the trial, while the Constitution says the chief justice should preside for the trial of a president.

""That would send a pretty clear signal to me what Roberts thinks of the whole thing,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, who declined to say how he would vote on Paul's motion.

House managers prepare their case

On Monday, the House impeachment managers, a group of Democratic lawmakers who will act as prosecutors presenting the case against Trump during the trial, delivered the single article of impeachment to the Senate. The article, approved by the Democrat-led House, charges Trump with incitement of insurrection for provoking the attack on the US Capitol that left multiple people dead.

The two-week break until the trial begins will give both sides more time to prepare for the trial. Trump is still hiring lawyers for his impeachment legal defense team, which is being led by South Carolina lawyer Butch Bowers

As the House impeachment managers put together their plans for the trial, they are considering using a variety of video evidence to show how the rioters were responding to Trump's own words when they breached the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the deliberations.

The impeachment managers are still wading through the huge amount of video that exists from January 6 to determine what they should use at the trial, the sources said, including video posted to the conservative social media site Parler. The House's impeachment team has taken an interest in a 10-minute video compilation from the national security forum Just Security , which uses social media posts from rioters on Facebook and Parler to illustrate how they were reacting in real-time to Trump's comments at the January 6 rally as well as Trump's social media posts when they attacked the Capitol.

No decisions have been finalized about how to use the video. The Washington Post first reported on the impeachment managers' interest in the Just Security clip.

At the first Trump impeachment trial, House impeachment managers also used video to bolster their case that Trump had pushed for Ukraine's help to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden. The use of video for the upcoming trial is even more compelling given the disturbing images and video that have emerged of rioters ransacking the Capitol and attacking police officers.

The transmission of the article typically triggers a quick start to an impeachment trial, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and McConnell reached a deal last week to push back the start date for the substance of the proceedings. That move will give Democrats more time to confirm Biden's Cabinet and potentially take up a new Covid-19 relief bill while Trump's defense team will have more time to prepare for trial.

It remains to be seen how long the trial will last, whether the House impeachment managers will seek witnesses and what the exact contours of the President's legal defense will be.

When the trial gets underway, one visible difference between the proceedings and Trump's first impeachment trial will be that instead of Roberts, the president pro tempore of the Senate, Leahy, will preside.

It would take a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict Trump, a high bar to clear that looks increasingly unlikely to happen as a number of Senate Republicans are already arguing that it's illogical and may be unconstitutional to impeach a former president.

Under the agreement reached by Schumer and McConnell, several ceremonial functions of the trial will take place this week. On Tuesday, the Senate is also expected to issue a summons to Trump, another step in the process of organizing for the trial to kick into high gear.

Then the trial will effectively be put on hold as the impeachment managers and Trump's legal team exchange pre-trial briefs for two weeks. The final briefs would be due on February 9, allowing the trial to begin in earnest.

Trump adds another South Carolina lawyer to impeachment defense team amid questions of whether he will pay them,"(CNN) Former President Donald Trump has expanded his impeachment legal team by tapping a former prosecutor-turned-criminal defense lawyer, an addition that comes as Trump and his allies scramble to prepare a defense with less than two weeks until the Senate trial.

The addition of Deborah Barbier, a lawyer with a reputation for tackling high-profile, controversial clients, is the second attorney to join from South Carolina. Last week, Trump announced that Butch Bowers, an experienced political attorney who has represented numerous Republican elected officials, including former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, would lead his legal team.

The all-South Carolina legal team has surprised some attorneys, even those in the Palmetto State, but it underscores the outsized influence of one of Trump's most loyal allies, Lindsey Graham, the state's senior Republican senator, who recommended Bowers to Trump. It also highlights the challenges Trump was experiencing in building a legal team as his previous lawyers have largely stepped away from him.

Barbier joined Trump's impeachment team Monday, according to an email sent by the chair of the South Carolina State Committee of the American College of Trial Lawyers, where Barbier is a member. The email, which was first reported by The Post and Courier , was confirmed by three lawyers. Barbier did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.

""He certainly could not do better than Debbie. She is an astoundingly capable, skilled, experienced criminal lawyer who is used of handling very high-profile cases with controversial clients. He could never do better than Debbie,"" said E. Paul Gibson, vice chair of the state committee, who confirmed the email.

These high schoolers turned their tough experiences during the pandemic into powerful memoirs,"(CNN) A teenager left to care for his family. One who found his faith, and another who watched his father relapse into addiction. They are the firsthand accounts of a group of New Jersey high school students living during the pandemic, brought together in one powerful memoir.

The idea for the memoir came from Shawn Adler, an English teacher at Cliffside Park High School, who wanted to document what his students were going through -- both as a way for them to take ownership of their experiences and to share it with the world through creative writing.

""I was devastated to know that they were going through this, and many of them are going through this feeling alone."" Adler said. ""You know, your first reaction as a teacher is always, 'What can I do? How can I help?'""

Adler, a former journalist, said his students were over the moon with the idea.

All profits from the sale of the books, which are also in a double volume, will go toward a student scholarship fund.

""I was expecting them to roll their eyes. I was expecting them to give me the teenage cynicism,"" he said. ""They were so immediately on board with the project, I was flabbergasted.""

Biden plans to reopen Obamacare enrollment,"(CNN) President Joe Biden is expected to reopen enrollment on the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges on Thursday as part of a series of executive actions related to health care, taking a step to help uninsured Americans that his predecessor rejected.

It will be Biden's first move toward delivering on his campaign promise to bolster the landmark health reform law that he championed as vice president. And it comes as more Americans could be facing the loss of coverage because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn.

Open enrollment on the federal exchanges, which the Trump administration cut in half to six weeks, ended on December 15. But Biden has the power to reopen sign-ups, which will allow the uninsured to select policies, under a special enrollment period.

Biden has turned to executive actions in his first days in office to swiftly start putting in place his agenda and to wipe out that of his predecessor.

Thursday's focus is set to be on health care. Biden is also expected to sign measures strengthening Medicaid, as well as rescinding the Mexico City Policy on abortion and review the Title X abortion referral restrictions.

Augmenting the Affordable Care Act

Increasing the number of insured Americans by strengthening the Affordable Care Act was at the heart of Biden's health care campaign promises. However, his two main measures -- creating a government-run public option and increasing Obamacare's federal premium subsidies -- will require Congress and face plenty of opposition.

Reopening enrollment is a much easier lift, though it's unclear how much impact it will have.

Anyone who loses job-based health insurance coverage is already eligible to sign up on the exchanges within 60 days of becoming uninsured. Enrollment in the first five months of 2020 jumped 46% compared to the same period the year before, the Trump administration said in June.

Also, more people have appeared to hold on to job-based coverage than expected, while those who have lost their employment and most of their income have turned to Medicaid. Between February and August, Medicaid enrollment jumped by more than 5.8 million people, or 9.1%, according to federal data released in late December.

During the most recent open enrollment period, overall Obamacare sign-ups for 2021 coverage increased when comparing the 36 states participating on the federal exchange both this year and last year -- the only time that happened under Trump. But the number of new consumers for 2021 slid somewhat.

Making the changes work

The key to reopening enrollment will be publicizing it and providing help for people to sign up, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation discussion with navigators who assist those looking for coverage on the exchanges. They also say the period should last more than six weeks.

The Trump administration slashed advertising by 90% and deeply cut funding for enrollment assistance -- two measures Biden is expected to reverse. Unspent revenue from exchange user fees appear to have accumulated to more than $1 billion over fiscal years 2018 to 2020, according to Kaiser.

Just over half of consumers who looked for coverage during the open enrollment period for 2020 coverage encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million folks sought in-person help but couldn't get it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Monday.

Many health care moves expected

Thursday's measures will likely be the first of many efforts to bolster the Affordable Care Act and roll back Trump administration health care actions.

Among Biden's top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of Republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the Trump administration. It revolves around Congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid.

The case will continue even if the Justice Department under Biden withdraws, because it originated with Texas and other Republican-led states. But the President could work with the new Democratic majority in Congress to short circuit the GOP states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.

Biden will also likely want to reverse various measures the Trump administration put in place to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. These include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing Georgia to stop using the federal exchange , healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.

Biden's health care officials are also expected to focus on Medicaid.

The Supreme Court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in Arkansas and New Hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.

These measures run counter to Biden's promise to expand access to Medicaid so his administration is expected to seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.

Also, Congress has limited states' ability to trim their Medicaid rolls during the public health emergency. The Biden administration may want to continue some of those provisions after it ends."
The Republican Party is at war with itself as it charts its post-Trump future,"(CNN) A cold war is underway within the Republican Party as its members begin to navigate how former President Donald Trump and his legacy fit into the GOP's future.

Some in congressional leadership have signaled their desire to move the party beyond Trump by impeaching and convicting him. Allies of the former President, on the other hand, are proclaiming their loyalty to him in conservative media and in state and local party organizations. Still other Republicans remain fearful of the power Trump may yet wield in GOP primaries or see electoral possibilities in embracing a version of his populist-conservative approach.

The result is a Republican Party in a fight with itself over who will determine its path forward -- and, more crucially, who should be kept from the levers of power in the GOP. For the moment, party unity is giving way to recriminations, a culmination of the longstanding dispute between the party's grassroots and its leadership class that was mostly put on hold during Trump's presidency, when few Republicans dared to cross him.

""Republicans are entering the wilderness and looking desperately to point blame,"" said Erick Erickson, the conservative commentator and radio host. ""They're going to have to make room for each other or let the Democrats run over them in the midterms.""

Disunity could present a more existential threat to Republicans. In his final days in the White House, Trump raised the idea of starting a new political party , a senior Trump adviser told CNN. While others around him dismissed this scheme to launch a ""patriot party"" as unserious, the potential of a split among right-of-center voters looms for Republicans.

Erickson says the divide in the party isn't just philosophical but literal, with both sides having their own redoubts within the GOP infrastructure.

""The pre-Trump establishment right now largely runs the policy-making arm of the party, and the Trump wing controls the state party arms,"" he said. ""That can't last and have the party winning.""

For Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a six-term Illinois congressman and one of just 10 Republicans in the House to vote for impeachment, the party is in the midst of a difficult fight about its own identity.

""I do think we are in a battle,"" Kinzinger told CNN's Jim Sciutto Monday. ""And it may be a battle that really needs to happen for our party to say, what does it we stand for? Not when it comes to policy, but as much as anything, are we aspirational or are we a party that feeds on fear and division?""

Sanders gets in, Portman gets out

Two announcements on Monday reflected how much the Trump wing of the party remains in the GOP's driver's seat -- and that members of the pre-Trump establishment are fading.

The first was from former Trump White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders , who declared her candidacy for governor of Arkansas with a press release touting her allegiance to the former president.

""A trusted confidant of the President, Sarah advised him on everything from press and communications strategy to personnel and policy,"" read the release. ""For two and a half years, Sarah worked closely with the president, battling with the media, working with lawmakers and CEOs, and accompanying the president on every foreign trip, including dozens of meetings with foreign leaders."" Trump endorsed Sanders later on Monday, saying in a statement that she ""is a warrior who will always fight for the people of Arkansas and do what is right, not what is politically correct.""

The second came from Sen. Rob Portman , the moderate Ohio Republican and veteran of the George W. Bush administration who announced he would not seek reelection in 2022 -- prompting a free-for-all for the GOP primary in a state that has taken an increasingly Republican turn in the Trump era.

Portman's decision to leave a ""safe seat tells you that he doesn't think much is going to get better in Washington, and we are unlikely to take the majority in '22,"" one strategist close to Republican fundraisers told CNN.

""We need all the moderates we can get,"" said a second GOP strategist familiar with Ohio Republican politics. ""He's exactly the type we want, and now he will be replaced by someone more 'conservative' by ideology or by positioning.""

McConnell, Cheney face backlash

But ""more conservative"" -- or at least more dedicated to Trump -- is exactly what those most loyal to the former President want.

For the party's current problems, they blame Republicans too willing to toss Trump overboard following the election. That includes Sen. Mitch McConnell and Rep. Liz Cheney , two GOP leaders in Congress who publicly condemned Trump for his actions surrounding the January 6 insurrection.

Cheney, the chair of the House Republican conference, was among the House Republicans who voted for impeachment earlier this month. For that vote, some of the most strident Trump allies in the GOP conference are threatening to strip her of her leadership role. And one of them, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, is going to Cheney's home state of Wyoming this week to speak out against her vote.

McConnell, meanwhile, has only gestured at his openness to voting to convict, but that has been enough to turn up the pressure from some Republican colleagues. And in two recent speeches on the Senate floor, the Republican leader harshly criticized Trump's actions surrounding the attack and denounced the lie propagated by the President that the 2020 election was stolen from him.

All of that's made McConnell a target of pro-Trump voices in the conservative media.

""Mitch McConnell, if you're not going to fight, we deserve better,"" said Fox News host Sean Hannity last week. ""You can go back to representing the people of Kentucky and let somebody that knows how to lead, lead.""

Many Republicans with potential White House ambitions are therefore treading lightly.

Sens. Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton, for example, did not object to counting electoral votes like their other ambitious colleagues Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley did. But Trump remains popular among Republican voters, and most polls show little appetite among them to impeach Trump.

So both Rubio and Cotton, along with other senators who may be looking at running for President, have already indicated they won't support convicting Trump -- a potential hedge against primary voters who may be counting fealty to Trump as an asset in a presidential nominee.

Trump's party in the states, too

In some states, party committees and local activists have been lashing out at those who have not sufficiently defended Trump. Backed by Trump himself, Republicans in Georgia have gone after their own elected officials, including Gov. Brian Kemp and secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, for not trying to overturn the election.

In a statement following the January 13 House vote on impeachment, the Texas Republican Party blasted the vote as ""frivolous and cruel."" And last week, the Oregon Republican Party released a lengthy, fiction-filled statement calling the 10 GOP votes to impeach Trump a ""betrayal.""

Over the weekend, the Arizona Republican Party, which had just narrowly reelected its pro-Trump chairwoman Kelli Ward, passed resolutions censuring three of the state's most prominent Republicans: Cindy McCain, former Sen. Jeff Flake, and Gov. Doug Ducey.

What happened in Arizona -- a longtime Republican state that Trump lost and where Democrats are ascendant -- worries longtime GOP operatives like Michael Steel, a former top aide to House Speaker John Boehner.

""If you say to the people of Arizona that your successful, conservative, two-term governor is somehow a problem, you are dooming yourself to minority status,"" Steel told CNN.

Erickson agrees.

""A party that isn't big enough for Dick Cheney's daughter, Trump's secretary of transportation's husband, John McCain's wife, and the sitting governors of Arizona and Georgia is a party not big enough to win,"" he said."
Tracking Corporate America’s revolt against the Electoral College objectors,"How CNN reported this project

For this project, CNN used data from the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) listing political donations to any of the 147 Congress members who objected to certifying the 2020 Electoral College results on January 6. The data captured more than 11,000 payments by corporate political action committees (PACs) made between Jan. 1, 2019 and Dec. 31, 2020 and totaling roughly $44.5 million.

We then used the Fortune 500 list to identify 283 companies who, through their PACs, made contributions to any of the objectors. We surveyed the companies to learn more about their political contribution policies following the US Capitol riot on January 6. We excluded three companies because they had either dissolved their PAC (Campbell Soup), went bankrupt (Dean Foods) or were acquired by another company (TD Ameritrade) prior to January 6.

For each of the remaining 280 companies, whose contributions collectively totalled about $21 million, we asked:

Had the company decided to suspend its political contribution activity?

If so, was the company suspending all political giving, or only political giving to specific politicians (such as congressional candidates or the Electoral College objectors)?

How long did the company plan to suspend its political giving? (E.g., less than six months, between six months and one year, through the 2022 or 2024 elections, indefinitely, or permanently)

About 150 companies responded. We then categorized the companies’ responses to build our database. When companies said they had suspended political giving but declined to say for how long, we categorized the suspensions as “indefinite.”

Spokespeople for some companies offered written statements in response to CNN’s questions. Where possible, we parsed these statements to categorize the company’s position. In cases where companies were willing to say, on-the-record, who said or authored a written statement, we have included the statement in our database. Several companies offered unsigned written statements, which CNN has declined to publish.

In some cases, companies reported different contribution amounts from those reported by CRP. In those cases, CNN has displayed totals based on data from the Federal Election Commission. These discrepancies may be due to reporting delays, since committees are not required to file their year-end reports until January 31. We have excluded negative values, which can represent returned contributions from current or previous election cycles. Accordingly, all contribution totals should be interpreted as estimates."
US airport screeners confiscated guns at record rate in 2020,"(CNN) — Airport security screeners are finding guns at US checkpoints at about twice the rate they did in 2019, according to new Transportation Security Administration data.

TSA said it found about 10 firearms per million passengers in 2020, compared to five per million passengers in 2019. The agency said it found 3,257 guns in total last year, and 83% were loaded.

The rate of guns found has grown as the number of people screened at checkpoints has dropped.

TSA is currently screening less than 40% of traffic that it did a year ago.

Screeners stopped passengers with firearms at 234 airports in 2020.

With 220 guns, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had the most firearms discovered at TSA checkpoints.

In July 2020, the rate of guns found spiked to more than 15 guns per million travelers -- when travel was at one of its lowest levels during the pandemic."
Capitol riot: Justice Department has charged least 150 people,"(CNN) At least 150 people have now been charged by federal prosecutors in connection with the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, according to a CNN review of court records and Justice Department announcements, as a top prosecutor said charges of sedition are not out of the question.

The milestone of 150 charged in the riot comes less than a day after the US House transmitted to the Senate an article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump for inciting insurrection. Trump will now face a trial in the same Senate chamber that rioters -- aiming to stop Congress' certification of President Joe Biden's electoral win -- breached minutes after members of the Senate had been hurried to safety.

Investigators have used 500 grand jury subpoenas and search warrants to gather information in the sweeping, unparalleled investigation, Michael Sherwin, the top US prosecutor in Washington, said in a news conference Tuesday.

Sedition, among other charges, is ""what we're trying to build toward,"" Sherwin said.

The dragnet has stretched across the country, with arrests in Florida, California, New Hampshire and Hawaii.

Many of the at least 150 defendants that CNN has identified have been charged with entering a restricted building without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct in the Capitol. The more serious charges have ranged from theft of government property, conspiracy, interstate threats, to assault on law enforcement.

The Justice Department now has more than 400 subjects in its investigation, Sherwin said Tuesday.

The FBI's Steven D'Antuono said the agency has received 200,000 digital media tips from the public about the insurrection.

Law enforcement officials have told CNN they expect hundreds of more riot participants to be arrested in the future. But they also say investigators have begun to focus on the more complex cases, like extremist groups that participated in the attack, and less on the low-hanging fruit arrests and charges.

Sherwin said prosecutors are building toward charging Capitol riot defendants with sedition, as well as looking groups from various states who coordinated coming to the Capitol and in other long-term planning.

""We are going to reach a plateau I think in the very near future ... and the plateau will involve in looking at the more complicated conspiracy cases related to possible coordination among militia groups,"" Sherwin said.

So far, the Justice Department had been bringing cases against people largely identified on the Internet, for violent entry and trespassing, and some violence toward police and weapons charges.

The cases that have resulted in arrests already are progressing slowly, with many of the defendants going before federal judges in their home states before they move to Washington, DC. There's a bottleneck as well in the DC federal court, and many haven't yet seen a judge or had their charges formally indicted. The Justice Department has agreed to let many of the defendants be released as they await trials, with various restrictions including stay-away-orders from DC.

A few defendants, such as men who allegedly threatened to kill lawmakers or brought bombs to the Capitol, will stay in detention, judges have ruled, and a handful are sitting in jail as federal judges review their detention decisions.

Over the course of the riot, prosecutors say approximately 81 Capitol Police and 58 DC Metro police officers were assaulted. Capitol Hill officer Brian Sicknick died responding to the riot, ""due to injuries sustained while on-duty,"" according to a Capitol Police statement.

More charges to come

D'Antuono, the FBI assistant director in Washington, DC, told reporters Tuesday that investigators are still looking for Capitol rioters who assaulted law enforcement officers and the person or people responsibility for planting pipe bombs outside of Republican and Democratic party headquarters buildings

The agency is still offering a $75,000 reward for help in the pipe bomb investigation, D'Antuono said.

""It is challenging, it is complex and it is big ... at the FBI, we do big, we do challenging, we do complex,"" D'Antuono said in a news conference. ""This case is unique in its magnitude and number of subjects.""

The flurry of arrests and charges takes place against the backdrop of the new Biden administration beginning to take the reins of the Justice Department, which could speak to their continued absence.

Filing such major charges would likely require sign-off from the new Biden administration officials at Justice headquarters, which is currently led by acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson and acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin. Senate confirmation for Biden's pick for Attorney General Merrick Garland and deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco is likely weeks away.

Sedition is a Civil War-era law that brings up to 20-year penalties for plotting to overthrow the US government and to use force to oppose US government authority or to delay the execution of a US law. Last summer, amid street protests following the police killing of George Floyd, then- Attorney General William Barr encouraged federal prosecutors to use the law against leftist protesters, a move that no one made.

Kobe Bryant wasn't just an NBA star. He was an ambassador for all sports,"(CNN) NBA legend Kobe Bryant , who died last year at age 41, will likely be best known for his gifts with the roundball. He was one of the best to take the court and one of basketball's greatest ambassadors, heralding the men's and women's game at its youth, college, pro and international levels.

Yet the Los Angeles Lakers luminary was multifaceted -- serving as a writer, producer, spokesman, philanthropist, mentor and #girldad . The Black Mamba appreciated greatness in all its forms -- and saw sport as transformative.

He believed, like Nelson Mandela whom he quoted in an Instagram post in 2014 , that ""sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers.""

Bryant dunks the ball in his high school gym in Lower Merion, Pennsylvania, during a practice in 1996.

Here's a look at the times he directed his considerable light on the world's other sporting pastimes.

Volleyball

Sharia Washington, one of Bryant's two sisters, played volleyball for Temple, with a sportswriter declaring in 1997 that she was ""every bit the athlete Kobe is"" (and she was able to dunk before her little brother!). Bryant's oldest child, Natalia, followed in her aunt's footsteps so, of course, he loved the game.

Soccer

An enormous fan of the international game, Bryant spent time as a child in Italy, where he learned to play soccer and love AC Milan, one of the country's most storied teams.

Paralympics and Olympics

Bryant joined Los Angeles' bid for the 2024 Olympics (the city was selected for the 2028 Games instead) and appeared with fellow gold medalist Michael Phelps at the Golden Goggles to give yet a third gold medalist, Katie Ledecky, the 2017 female swimmer of the year award . He's also been a stalwart for parasports.

""The lesson I cherish the most is how important it is to love what you do,"" Bryant, freshly retired from the NBA, told Special Olympians in a 2016 video message . ""If you love what you do and it's making you happy, all the hard work and perseverance will pay off. When you know you're truly giving it your all, there's no greater feeling in the world.""

Football

Bryant returned to the United States when he was 13. After middle school, he played ball at Lower Merion High School, outside of Philadelphia, before heading straight to the pros. The City of Brotherly Love was anything but when Bryant returned in the Lakers' purple and gold. Philadelphians regularly booed their hometown prodigy, but Bryant always remained true to his Eagles

He also spoke with reverence for stars like Tom Brady, Richard Sherman and Ray Lewis, who, like Bryant, fought to restore his image following criminal allegations away from the field of play. During a 2012 national championship matchup, Bryant showed his love for the college game, applauding Alabama's AJ McCarron and Barrett Jones after a midgame scuffle

Good luck to my man @raylewis today

Tennis

Bryant showed more GOAT-on-GOAT love with snaps alongside Roger Federer Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams, who he described as ""top of the line for me"" when it came to tennis players.

Bryant often had the next generation on his mind, and Williams served as a muse for one of his literary creations, ""Legacy and the Queen,"" about a 12-year-old tennis player who must win a tournament to keep an orphanage open.

""I want kids to learn by reading our novels, and in our latest book, our main character has to learn to use her passion for tennis to rise above those around her and shine,"" the father of four said of the book.

Auto racing

OK, OK, Bryant didn't talk about auto racing so much. This header is more an excuse to include his ""Mamba on the track!"" post, featuring the Lakers shooting guard, during a trip to the town of Maranello, Italy , flying by in a canary-yellow Ferrari.

Martial arts

One fighter, however, stood above the rest: the inimitable Bruce Lee. Not only did Mamba tell a Chinese newspaper in 2017 that the famed martial artist's Jeet Kune Do philosophy helped him learn the importance of being able to adapt and react, but Nike has released multiple Bruce Lee editions of Bryant's line of sneakers.

""Bruce Lee was always one of my muses growing up,"" Bryant told the newspaper. ""I've read everything he's ever written; I've watched every film he's ever been in, and I've watched pretty much every interview he's ever done.""

Happy birthday to the great Bruce Lee #BruceLee75 #legend — Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) November 27, 2015

Baseball

He grew up a Yankees fan, but Bryant said he always had love for the Dodgers. He once joined then-Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp, President Bill Clinton and Olympic gold medalist sprinter Allyson Felix for a roundtable about the importance of children playing sports.

Great to talk shop with @MagicJohnson I grew up a Yankee fan but I rep my city!! #LALOVE #dodgers. Rivera and Jeter #purevino #epiclegends — Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) August 1, 2013

Hockey

A regular at Los Angeles Kings games, Bryant applauded the team after it twice in three seasons hung championship banners from the Staples Center rafters, where Bryant's teams hung five.

Many National Hockey League players lamented his death, including superstar Alex Ovechkin. New Jersey Devils defenseman P.K. Subban, one of a few dozen Black players in the NHL, revealed after Bryant's death that the baller had served as a mentor

Shocked and in complete disbelief... A father, husband, legend, and idol gone way too soon. Thank you for the time, the lessons, and 20 years of greatness. #ripmamba🐍 pic.twitter.com/oqAtpaMlz8 — P.K. Subban (@PKSubban1) January 26, 2020

Snowboarding

Hardly a shocker that when Bryant brought up snowboarding, he focused on the sport's greatest, Shaun White.

Horseracing

Bryant and Lakers teammate Pau Gasol once owned an interest in a horse, Siempre Mio -- Spanish for ""Always Mine."" While that is a little-known factoid, better known is that Bryant took inspiration from the best, including the best of the best: Secretariat

""I was like a wild horse that had the potential to become Secretariat, but who was just too f**king wild. So part of that was (Lakers coach Phil Jackson) trying to tame me,"" he once said

References Kobe Bryant makes in his Q&A:

Dancing

During ""Dancing With the Stars,"" Bryant backed actor and singer Zendaya, using the hashtags #differentanimalsamebeast and #beastmode, which he typically reserved for athletes he admired.

More importantly, this provides an opportunity to tidily end the story with a clip of a 12-year-old Kobe Bean popping and locking to a Vanilla Ice classic circa 1990."
Antony Blinken sworn in as Biden's secretary of state,"Washington (CNN) Antony Blinken said it is the honor of his life to serve as the top US diplomat after being sworn in as the newest secretary of state Tuesday.

Blinken, a longtime Biden associate , was approved by the Senate with a vote of 78-22 earlier in the day.

""My career has come full circle,"" Blinken wrote in a tweet Tuesday. ""I started at the @StateDept in 1993, and, today, it's the honor of my life to lead the Department's women and men as the 71st Secretary of State.""

""I want to thank my colleagues for welcoming me home,"" he added.

Blinken was sworn in at the State Department by Carol Perez, a career diplomat who is serving as acting under secretary for management. Photos from the event show him taking the oath of office on a copy of the US Constitution.

With Blinken's confirmation, President Joe Biden now has a number of key members of his national security team in place. In addition to national security adviser Jake Sullivan -- who does not require Senate confirmation -- Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines was confirmed on Inauguration Day and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed last Friday.

Blinken's confirmation was welcomed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as the professional association for the US Foreign Service.

""Leadership of the Department of State, our nation's oldest cabinet agency, represents a great responsibility,"" the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) said in a statement. ""As we have done for his predecessors, AFSA extends our congratulations and welcome to Secretary Blinken. We wish the Secretary and his team the best of luck in the years ahead. AFSA and its members pledge to work alongside them to strengthen the career Foreign Service and protect and enhance the institution that is American diplomacy.""

The 71st secretary of state faces the challenges of restoring America's standing in the world and reinvigorating a department where many felt demoralized under the past administration.

He will also be on the forefront of directing a sharp turn from ""America First"" foreign policy to one that focuses on multilateralism and coalitions.

During his confirmation hearing last week, Blinken pledged to reengage with Congress on key foreign policy concerns.

He was pressed on Iran and efforts to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. While Blinken made clear the Biden administration feels the world was safer with the Iran nuclear deal in place, he did not offer specifics on plans to rejoin the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2018.

""The President-elect believes that if Iran comes back into compliance, we would too,"" Blinken said at his hearing a day before the inauguration last week. ""But, we would use that as a platform with our allies and partners who would once again be on the same side with us, to seek a longer and stronger agreement. And also, as you and the chairman have rightly pointed out, to capture these other issues, particularly with regard to missiles and Iran's destabilizing activities. That would be the objective.""

""Having said that, I think we're a long way from there, we would have to see once the President-elect is in office what steps Iran actually takes and is prepared to take,"" Blinken said.

On China, he conceded that President Donald Trump ""was right in taking a tougher approach to China.""

""I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one, and I think that's actually helpful to our foreign policy,"" Blinken said.

He pledged to restore the agency he now leads, saying he is ""committed to advancing our security and prosperity by building a diplomatic corps that fully represents America in all its talent and diversity.""

And where his predecessor Mike Pompeo pledged to bring ""swagger,"" Blinken called for ""humility and confidence.""

""Humility because we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad. And humility because most of the world's problems are not about us, even as they affect us. Not one of the big challenges we face can be met by one country acting alone -- even one as powerful as the US,"" he said. ""But we'll also act with confidence that America at its best still has a greater ability than any country on earth to mobilize others for the greater good."""
Acting Capitol Police chief tells Congress the department 'failed' during riot,"(CNN) The acting head of the US Capitol Police told congressional members during a closed-door briefing Tuesday that the ""department failed to meet its own high standards"" on January 6 when a crowd of pro-Trump rioters overran the Capitol building.

Acting US Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman called the insurrection a ""terrorist attack"" and offered her ""sincerest apologies on behalf of the department,"" according to her prepared remarks during a briefing for lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee with a number of agencies that had a role in security on January 6.

Pittman also said the department was aware of a ""strong potential for violence"" targeting Congress and did not take the appropriate steps to prevent it.

Pittman's admission comes as US Capitol Police officers are debating whether to hold a no-confidence vote targeting department leaders who were working on the day of insurrection, including Pittman. One source told CNN that Pittman was the operational chief the day of the siege at the Capitol and ""never took control of the radio or commanded officers what to do in any way, shape or form.""

""Let me be clear: the Department should have been more prepared for this attack,"" Pittman said Tuesday. ""By January 4th, the Department knew that the January 6th event would not be like any of the previous protests held in 2020. We knew that militia groups and white supremacists organizations would be attending. We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event.""

Ultimately, Pittman took responsibility for mistakes that were made in protecting the Capitol.

""As the Acting Chief, I take responsibility for the mistakes that were made by the Department, and I pledge to this Committee, the Congress, the American people, and my USCP colleagues, that we will do better going forward, but we need to make changes,"" she said.

Acting Sergeant at Arms Timothy Blodgett issued a blunt assessment Tuesday of the security failures that occurred, both in preparing for a protest of this nature and reacting to events as they unfolded, according to his prepared statement during Tuesday's briefing in front of lawmakers.

""It is clear there was a failure of preparation. Whether it was insufficient or conflicting intelligence, lacking ability to translate that intelligence into action, insufficient preparation or an inadequate ability to mobilize partner agencies for immediate assistance, a series of events, once thought unfathomable, unfolded allowing our most sacred halls to be breached. And, sadly, several lives were lost, including Officer Brian Sicknick and Officer Howard Liebengood,"" Blodgett said in his remarks.

Pittman outlined four things that made the department ill-equipped to respond to the attack, including the lack of manpower. The acting chief said USCP officers did not have the right equipment on hand or easily accessible, and the process for sealing the building ""may not have been consistently followed."" Lastly, Pittman stated that the department was told that communication over their radios and the public address system were hard to hear during the attack.

Since the insurrection, Pittman said USCP has coordinated with the National Guard to secure the Capitol and the complex surrounding it and has ""taken steps to ensure"" that USCP is sharing and receiving critical intelligence information from its law enforcement partners. Pittman also said that the department's intelligence director is now holding daily internal intelligence briefings with USCP officials.

Pittman said that going forward, ""the Capitol's security infrastructure must change and that the Department needs access to additional resources -- both manpower and physical assets.""

Proximity to power: What the West Wing office layout says about the Biden administration,"(CNN) It's an adage in any high-pressure office: proximity is power. Nowhere is that more true than the West Wing.

Unlike his predecessor, who professed a love for governing by chaos and whose aides were constantly jockeying for face-time, Biden appears more likely to go by-the-book. Officials say his meetings are run more traditionally, with a set list of attendees and usually an agenda.

And the door to the Oval Office won't be kept open for aides to drop in, as in the Trump-era. Traditional gatekeepers such as the chief of staff and an executive assistant will have the kind of control over Biden's schedule that didn't exist during periods of President Donald Trump's tenure.

But the opportunity that comes with a choice workspace remains. And the value of prime White House real estate is even higher, considering how many aides are working remotely during the pandemic.

It's not about whether the offices afford a majestic view of Washington, considering many of the work spaces have little to no external views at all. Instead, the proximity to the Oval Office offers an unspoken nod to the hierarchy surrounding the President.

Office space can also be used to elevate a particular official or issue critical to the President's agenda. Biden has placed Jeff Zients, his Covid response coordinator, in an office on the second floor, lending stature to his role in combating the pandemic.

Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, senior advisers to Biden who are longtime members of his inner circle, are setting up shop in small offices just steps from the Oval Office and the President's private dining room. They take over rooms once occupied by advisers such as Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon during the Trump administration, David Axelrod during President Barack Obama's and George Stephanopoulos when Bill Clinton was president.

At the end of the hall, Ron Klain, the chief of staff, has a corner office with a fireplace and an outdoor terrace. Aside from the Oval Office, it's the most spacious office in the West Wing. Vice President Kamala Harris also has a large office just next door, along with far more spacious quarters in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which sits next to the White House.

Jennifer O'Malley Dillon and Bruce Reed, who serve as deputy chiefs of staff, also sit in the narrow alcoves with close access to the Oval Office.

Situated right outside the Oval Office are staff who act as Biden's personal aides and manage the room's operation, including the ""director of Oval Office operations"" -- a position once held by Trump's former bodyguard.

In the other ""corner offices"" on the first floor of the West Wing are the national security adviser and the press secretary. Both frequently attend meetings with the President.

Ordinarily, their deputies and assistants would crowd the desks outside their offices. Yet the coronavirus pandemic has altered how the building is filled.

Gone are the days of aides stuffing into offices for brain-storming sessions or meetings. The Biden administration is taking the pandemic remarkably seriously -- far more so than the last occupants of these offices -- and many advisers are not allowed in the West Wing.

The pandemic has scattered some key aides who would ordinarily work from the West Wing to other parts of the White House campus, officials said, with myriad Covid-19 precautions in place, including regular testing, universal masking and other safety measures

""Additional aides are working from home and using a variety of tools to stay in touch and carry out their work,"" a White House official told CNN.

The White House counsel, the directors of the National Economic Council, office of legislative affairs and domestic policy are all expected to be on the second floor of the West Wing, along with those heading up the fight against coronavirus.

Unlike in the Trump administration, no family members will occupy formal roles or offices in the West Wing. And unlike in the Clinton administration, the first lady will not have a West Wing office. Jill Biden will work from the traditional first lady's quarters in the East Wing of the White House.

Some alumni from the Obama administration may find the West Wing looks slightly different from when they left four years ago. Under Trump, the carpets were changed out, walls were painted and some of the hardware was refreshed during a renovation early in his term. Air conditioning and heating systems were also replaced.

But the scale of the space has remained the same. Aside from the offices in the corners of the building, the working spaces are minuscule -- particularly for officials accustomed to more spacious conditions."
US Capitol officers debating no-confidence vote for leaders in charge during Capitol riots,"(CNN) US Capitol Police officers are in preliminary discussions over holding a no-confidence vote targeting department leaders who were working on the day when Donald Trump supporters led an insurrection into the building, according to three people familiar with the discussions.

The vote would target acting USCP Chief Yogananda Pittman, who was promoted into the agency's top job following the resignation of Steven Sund after the insurrection. At least four additional chiefs may be targeted as part of any no-confidence vote, the three sources said.

News of the discussion comes as Pittman spoke to congressional members during a closed-door briefing Tuesday, where she said the ""department failed to meet its own high standards"" on January 6, adding that police ""knew there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.""

One source told CNN that Pittman was the operational chief that day and ""never took control of the radio or commanded officers what to do in any way shape or form.""

One Capitol police source said stewards from the USCP Labor Committee, the union representing rank-and-file officers, visited section roll calls to take the temperature of officers on the potential no-confidence vote.

Biden to halt new oil and gas leases on federal lands Wednesday,"(CNN) President Joe Biden is set to order a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with his plans.

The move is expected to be the most prominent in a series of climate actions the President will take on Wednesday, including elevating the climate crisis as a national security issue.

The halt on new leases, which would fulfill a campaign promise by Biden, would apply to federal land and water areas, but wouldn't affect existing leases. It would allow the administration to conduct a comprehensive review of the federal leasing program.

Biden is also expected to take action on protecting 30% of the country's land and water by 2030, known as ""30 by 30."" A 2018 study by the Center for American Progress , a liberal advocacy organization based in Washington, found that only 12% of the country's land has been conserved, including as national parks and national wildlife refuges.

The moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands expands the 60-day moratorium Biden signed on his first day in office.

Johnson & Johnson plans to report out Covid-19 vaccine trial results by early next week,"A nurse fills a syringe with a vial of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at the Pasteur Institute, in Paris, on January 21. Christophe Archambault/AFP/ Getty Images

France will maintain about three to four weeks between the two Pfizer/BioNTech doses, Health Minister Olivier Veran said at a Tuesday news conference.

Last week, the French health authority and the French medicine approval agency suggested delaying the second injection as an option to allow more people to get vaccinated.

“Let's not change the injection schedule for the Pfizer vaccine,"" Veran clarified on Tuesday.

Veran said French health authorities would not opt to delay the second dose because it would only give a small advantage and because of “the lack of scientific consensus.”

In politics you have to choose. And I therefore maintain, on the basis of the information at my disposal, the injection time between two Pfizer injections at 21 or 28 days, that is to say three to four weeks.”

Weighing in on the potential delivery delays of the AstraZeneca vaccine -- which still needs European Medicines Agency approval for emergency use -- the minister said any supply issues would impact all member states.

“Each of the 27 countries of the European Union is receiving a proportional number of doses to its population within the population of the European Union and if there are delays, they will be the same for everybody,"" Veran said.

The big picture in France: More than 3,000 people are in intensive care units (ICUs) in the country due to severe Covid symptoms for the first time since December 9, according to the latest data from the health agency.

As of Monday evening, there were 3,031 patients in ICUs, the agency said -- an increase of 76 people in 24 hours.

There are 26,888 people in hospital, an increase of 531 patients in the past 24 hours. To date, 73,494 have died of Covid-related illnesses in France.

French media have been speculating whether President Emmanuel Macron would address the country this week and announce increased restrictions.The Elysée palace press office told CNN on Monday, however, that there were no plans for Macron to make a TV address this week.

His office added that the effectiveness of the current 6 p.m. curfew would be reviewed as planned on Saturday, two weeks after it was imposed nationwide."
Washington Post editor Marty Baron announces his retirement,"New York (CNN Business) Marty Baron, the editor who transformed the Washington Post into an international powerhouse and led the news organization to win 10 Pulitzer Prizes, is retiring next month.

Baron, 66, said in an internal memo Tuesday morning that he feels ""ready to move on."" His last day at the paper will be February 28.

""From the moment I arrived at The Post, I have sought to make an enduring contribution while giving back to a profession that has meant so much to me and that serves to safeguard democracy,"" Baron wrote. ""It has been my honor to work alongside hundreds of journalists who make The Post an indispensable institution.""

Baron also shared his plans in a virtual meeting with company executives and his managing and senior editors Tuesday morning. His retirement had been anticipated inside the Post for some time, and Baron had been in discussions about the exact timing with Fred Ryan, The Post's CEO.

""Although we have long known this day would come, it does not lessen the emotion we feel,"" Ryan wrote in his own memo Tuesday morning.

""Under Marty's eight years of newsroom leadership, The Washington Post has experienced a dramatic resurgence and has soared to new journalistic heights,"" Ryan wrote. ""As Executive Editor, he has significantly expanded our coverage areas, inspired great reporting, managed an awesome digital transformation and grown the number of readers and subscribers to unprecedented levels.""

JUST WATCHED The real-life inspirations for the 'Spotlight' movie Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The real-life inspirations for the 'Spotlight' movie 04:25

Ryan pointed out that the Post employed 580 journalists when Baron arrived at the beginning of 2013. Later that same year, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought the newspaper . Bezos retained Baron and gave him more money to work with.

The Post's newsroom now exceeds 1,000 journalists and continues to grow. ""The newsroom of 2021 will be the biggest in history, an investment that signals overwhelming confidence in our prospects,"" Baron wrote. ""In sum, The Post has come a long way in a short time.""

Key to the Post's expansion was a digital subscription model fueled by scoops and other must-read stories.

Both inside and outside the Post, Baron was credited with steadying the editorial ship through business model turbulence, political attacks and international crises.

In 2014 and 2015, he demanded justice for the Post's Tehran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian, who was arrested by Iranian authorities and charged with espionage. Baron helped keep Rezaian's case in the news and worked for his release, which came in early 2016

In 2017, as President Trump bashed the Post and observers talked about a war between Trump and the media, Baron pushed back with a memorable turn of phrase: ""We're not at war, we're at work.""

A report by Harvard's Shorenstein Center said that Baron was ""widely considered to be one of the best editors working today.""

Baron arrived at The Post at the beginning of 2013 after twelve years running The Boston Globe.

At The Globe, Baron's many accomplishments included oversight of a legendary expose of serial sexual abuse by priests within the Boston Archdiocese. Liev Schreiber played Baron in the ensuing 2015 film ""Spotlight,"" which won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

""Marty coming to The Globe was a great example of what a pair of fresh eyes can do,"" Globe reporter Sacha Pfeiffer said on ""Reliable Sources"" in 2015. ""There had been court files against priests sealed for years. And no one at The Globe had really questioned them or thought to unseal them. Marty showed up new to town and he asked, 'Why haven't we tried to seal them?' And he sent The Globe lawyers to court to do that. And he put the investigative team on the project. And we did it.""

Baron said he was motivated by reading a Globe column that said ""the truth may never be known"" about pedophile priests.

""When you say the truth may never be known, that should be a red flag to journalists to go after something and really find out what the truth is,"" Baron said.

That spirit fueled his support of Washington Post reporters, as well. One of the paper's major investigations in recent years was based on a confidential trove of government documents. Named the Afghanistan Papers, the documents were only unsealed after a three-year legal battle by the Post.

In a 2019 interview on ""Reliable Sources,"" Baron said ""it's absolutely central to our mission to do investigations, to hold government to account, to hold all-powerful individuals and powerful institutions to account. That's why we have a free press in this country.""

At the end of 2020, he announced that the Post was on the verge of ""full 24/7 coverage"" by adding news-gathering hubs in Asia and Europe.

""If you recall,"" Baron said, ""it wasn't that long ago that people were talking about news organizations like the Washington Post and the New York Times being on their deathbed. And here we are. We're growing, they're growing. There are enormous signs of success for news organizations like ours around the country.""

In his internal memo on Tuesday, Baron wrote, ""Please don't lose sight of how hard our gains as a commercial enterprise were to achieve. They would be easy to lose. In 2013, when our outlook was dire, we were given a second chance. We took it, engineering a turnaround with focus and creativity. Keep at it.""

He also reflected on some of the work that's unfinished. ""We aspire to greater breadth, depth and distinctiveness in our work,"" he wrote. ""We can improve how we practice our craft. We can do more and better in pursuing our digital destiny. We must cover all communities with deeper understanding. We need a wider diversity of life experiences and backgrounds represented in our newsroom and reflected in our coverage. On all these fronts we've made progress, but more is needed.""

The Post did not immediately announce a successor for Baron.

Ryan said the search for a new executive editor ""will be a broad and inclusive one, considering both outstanding internal candidates as well as journalists at other publications with the vision and ability to build upon Marty's success."""
Air pollution linked to increased risk of irreversible sight loss,"London (CNN) Increases in air pollution are linked to an increased risk of irreversible sight loss, according to a new study.

Researchers from University College London (UCL) found that even low exposure to air pollution across England, Scotland and Wales appears to impact the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among people over 50 in high-income countries. AMD is linked to the loss of central vision -- needed for reading, performing fine detailed tasks and recognizing faces -- and the biggest risk factors for the disease are genetics, old age and smoking.

Researchers found that people living in the most polluted areas were at least 8% more likely to report having the condition, in a study published Monday in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.

The team studied data from 115,954 people aged between 40-69, who had participated in the UK Biobank, a large study of half a million people focusing on the medical diagnoses and biological measurements of participants.

8 myths about the Covid-19 vaccine -- Dr. Wen explains,"(CNN) The United States crossed the terrible milestone of 400,000 deaths from coronavirus early last week, and there are currently over 2.1 million reported deaths worldwide, Johns Hopkins University data shows.

There are also new variants with mutations that could make Covid-19 even more transmissible and possibly even more deadly. However, there is also encouraging news, with two vaccines authorized for emergency use so far by the US Food and Drug Administration that are safe and very effective.

Two-thirds of Americans (66%) say they will try to get vaccinated and currently demand far outstrips supply, but 30% of Americans stated they will not, according to CNN poll results released January 21.

For those who are vaccine hesitant, what are some common myths about the vaccines, and how can each of us work to address these misconceptions?

We spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, about how everyone can debunk myths, ease concerns and spread accurate information about the Covid-19 vaccines.

CNN: Why is it important for everyone to know what myths are circulating about coronavirus vaccines?

Dr. Leana Wen: One of the key principles in public health is that the messenger is often more important than the message. You are the most trusted messenger to someone. It could be your parents, your work colleagues or your friends. Getting people vaccinated is our best hope of ending this pandemic, and we need everyone's help to convince people to do so.

The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine is administered to a staff member at the Ararat Nursing Facility in Los Angeles on January 7.

Another principle of public health is to meet people where they are. That means seeking to understand why someone may have hesitancy about the coronavirus vaccine. How you approach someone is going to be completely different if they are concerned about whether the vaccine is safe versus if they don't believe coronavirus is real. Listening to someone's concerns and then addressing them, with compassion and empathy, is crucial.

There are common myths I often hear from my patients, but there are things that each of us can say if someone around us expresses these myths.

CNN: Let's talk about vaccine safety. There must be a lot of myths around that.

Wen: A common myth is that getting the coronavirus vaccine will give you coronavirus. I hear this every year when it comes to the flu vaccine, too: Often, patients will say they don't want to get the flu vaccine because they think they'll get the flu from it.

Neither is true. If someone is concerned about this, you can say that none of the coronavirus vaccines being tested in the US contains live virus. So it's not possible to get coronavirus from the coronavirus vaccine.

Another set of myths is around the mRNA platform that is used for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. I've heard people worry about whether the vaccine will somehow affect their genetic code and alter their genes.

This is not true. It's helpful to explain what the mRNA technology is. The term ""mRNA"" stands for messenger RNA, which is a portion of the genetic code that teaches cells how to make a protein. The protein that's made by the mRNA then activates an immune response, teaching our bodies how to respond to coronavirus if we come into contact with it in the future.

What's very important to understand is what the mRNA does not do: It never enters the nucleus of people's cells, which is where our DNA is contained. That means the vaccine does not interact with people's DNA at all, and therefore will not alter our genetic code.

CNN: The mRNA technology is a new technology. Many have concerns that it's too new and that it was developed too fast.

Wen: There are two points here and two ways to address this concern. First, the mRNA technology has actually been in development for well over a decade. Second, I think it's critical to explain that no shortcuts were taken in the scientific research or approval processes. Yes, scientists did develop the vaccines in record time. But that's because the entire global scientific community went to work. They didn't start from scratch; after SARS and MERS outbreaks, a lot of work already went into starting the vaccine development.

The US government and other governments invested a lot of money in the research. And, frankly, we got lucky with the research to have two vaccines already that are safe and so effective. But every phase of the clinical research was followed as it is for other vaccines, with tens of thousands of volunteers in the clinical trials. External committees of independent scientists vetted the data and there were no shortcuts taken in vaccine authorization.

CNN: What about allergic reactions? Isn't there also a myth that these vaccines provoke too many allergic reactions and are therefore not safe?

Wen: It is true that there have been some reports of allergic reactions to the vaccines. Allergic reactions can occur to virtually any medical product. In the ER, we treat allergic reactions to food and medications all the time. They are much easier to treat than Covid-19.

At the moment, it's not clear as to why these very rare allergic reactions are happening. That's why everyone getting the Covid-19 vaccine is required to stay around for 15 minutes after receiving it. And if you have a history of severe allergic reactions, you might be required to wait 30 minutes. If a severe allergic reaction occurs, it can be treated with an EpiPen.

The remote possibility of a rare allergic reaction is no reason not to receive the vaccine. The very real and substantial benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the highly uncommon (and treatable) risks of allergic reactions. Those with food and medication allergies can still get the vaccine. The only reason you shouldn't get the vaccine is if you have a specific known reaction to a component of the vaccine itself.

CNN: Here's another myth — we don't know how long the vaccine provides immunity, so there is no point in taking it.

Wen: This is where acknowledging that the myth comes from a place of some truth is a good starting point. It is true that we don't know how long the immunity from the vaccine will last. Studies thus far suggest that it should last at least for several months, but we don't know whether immune protection from the vaccine wanes over time. It's also possible that enough mutations might arise that new vaccines need to be configured, and people who received the vaccine already may need a booster shot — as is the case with a tetanus shot. It may be that coronavirus vaccine becomes something that you have to get every year, like the flu vaccine.

But just because you may need to get the vaccine again at some point again doesn't mean you shouldn't get it the first time. Think about the flu vaccine: Just because you have to get it every year doesn't mean you should never get it at all.

CNN: What about young and healthy people saying that it's only those who are elderly or with underlying medical conditions who should get the vaccine?

Wen: Right now, when there is limited supply of the vaccine, we should prioritize those who are more likely to become severely ill to get the vaccine first. Eventually, when there's enough supply, we want everyone to get the vaccine.

Here's why. First, even those who are young and healthy may contract coronavirus and become very ill. It's less common, but deaths do occur in this population, too. Second, we need to strive for herd immunity through vaccination. That's the level at which the virus will substantially slow, and hopefully even stop, its spread. Public health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci have estimated that we need about 70% to 85% of the population vaccinated to reach that point.

The sooner we get people vaccinated, the earlier we can all return to some semblance of pre-pandemic normalcy and end the devastation of this disease. And that requires not only the elderly and more vulnerable, but all of us getting the vaccine.

CNN: I'm sure you've encountered folks who think they can stop wearing a mask after they get the vaccine.

Wen: Our understanding right now is that the Covid-19 vaccine prevents someone from getting ill, and the vaccine also guards against severe illness that results in hospitalization and deaths. That's really important. But we don't know whether the vaccine prevents someone from being a carrier of coronavirus who could infect others. Also, the vaccine appears to be 95% effective, which is amazing, but it's not 100%.

That's why people still have to use caution even after they are vaccinated. At some point, though, as we approach herd immunity through vaccination, we will be able to do away with masks. In the meantime, think of vaccines as a tool that doesn't replace other tools but is essential to saving lives.

CNN: What about people who say they are worried about the long-term effects, and think that as long as enough people get the vaccine, they don't need to bother?

Wen: This point of view that's based on some truth must be approached with compassion and empathy. Multiple surveys show that many Americans prefer not to be the first to be vaccinated. There are plenty of Americans who do want to be first, and right now, demand is far greater than supply.

Over the course of the next few months, many millions will be vaccinated. It's reasonable to point to these examples of people to say that we're showing, not just in tens of thousands of research participants, but in tens of millions of people, that the vaccine is safe and effective. You yourself getting vaccinated when it's your turn, and showing other examples of people in the community who are vaccinated, will also go a long way toward persuading reluctant friends and relatives.

Humility and honesty are key. We should acknowledge that the vaccines are relatively new so we don't know the long-term consequences. But then add that there is no reason to believe that the vaccines will cause ill effects long-term. We have a long history of developing vaccines, and scientifically, there is no evidence for long-term harm with those vaccines.

Donald Trump's impeachment case is now in the Senate's hands. Here's what's next,"A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here

(CNN) The House voted to impeach President Donald Trump on January 14, but waited until Monday to complete the next step in the process -- having House managers read the single article of impeachment aloud on the House floor and then walking it over to the Senate.

But the Senate impeachment trial itself won't get underway for two more weeks as senators get to work filling up Joe Biden's Cabinet and -- perhaps -- giving him the tools he needs to lead the country through the pandemic. ( Here's where things stand on that.

When the trial does get underway, one important no-show is expected to be Chief Justice John Roberts, who normally has a duty under the Constitution to preside over a presidential impeachment trial. This time, however, since Trump is a former president, Roberts will skip the proceedings and Sen. Patrick Leahy, the chamber's ranking Democrat, will hold the gavel

Roberts' court also declined Monday to hear whether Trump's hotels in DC and New York accepting money from foreign governments violated the Constitution's emoluments clause -- because the question about a president being enriched by foreigners is moot since voters have already shown Trump the door. Read more about emoluments.

Republican lawmakers want to move on. The refrain growing on Capitol Hill among Republicans is not so much that Trump's incitement of the mob that stormed the US Capitol was good conduct. It's why bother with this impeachment trial?

""I think so many are getting confused by the fact that we're doing this,"" said Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun, the Indiana Republican.

It seems clear there will be Republicans who support convicting Trump in the first-ever post-presidential impeachment -- Utah Sen. and former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney? Maine Sen. Susan Collins? Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse? -- but the number, for now, appears to be on track to fall well short of the necessary 17 to reach the necessary two-thirds majority.

There must be accountability. Romney, the one senator who broke with Trump on the Ukraine impeachment last year, certainly sounds like he could ultimately vote to convict Trump again.

""And, you know, if we're going to have unity in our country, I think it's important to recognize the need for accountability, for truth and justice,"" he said on Fox News Sunday, arguing there is a need for a Senate trial

Partisanship sucks, but... Ohio Sen. Rob Portman is among the shrinking group of senators who has wanted to appear open to compromise legislation, although he has always found a way to vote with his team. Announcing Monday he wouldn't run for reelection in 2022, Portman made clear that partisan bickering was the main reason. An impeachment trial won't help cure that, even if Trump's actions demanded it.

The evidence suggests Trumpism isn't going anywhere quite yet. Trump fled Washington before Biden's inauguration and is now ensconced at Mar-a-Lago. The Trump fled Washington before Biden's inauguration and is now ensconced at Mar-a-Lago. The Washington Post reported that he has floated the idea of forming his own MAGA political party -- in part to keep Republican senators in line during this second impeachment.

Arizona, which used to be the home of modern conservatism, is an instructive example. The state party reelected Trump follower Kelli Ward to run the state party despite Trump's loss there, going 0-2 in recent US Senate races and shrinking party registrations. Arizona is at least purple but the party is not seeking middle ground. In addition to keeping Ward as its leader, party members voted to publicly censure Cindy McCain, widow of former Sen. John McCain, and former Sen. Jeff Flake, for supporting Biden, as well as Gov. Doug Ducey for enacting Covid restrictions

Out with the old. While Mitch McConnell might quietly be hoping to purge Trump from the GOP, there's a much louder effort to purge Republicans who opposed the insurrection and cast blame upon Trump.

Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz told reporters Monday that he plans to fly to Wyoming to personally campaign against Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, maintaining her leadership role. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he has concerns about her leadership capability

In with the new. Republicans who supported contesting electoral votes even after the insurrection -- Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, or North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn -- have more forcefully defended their position. Hawley wrote in the New York Post that he's actually the victim in all this. Republicans who supported contesting electoral votes even after the insurrection -- Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, or North Carolina Rep.

Cawthorn tried to explain his position to CNN's Pamela Brown over the weekend , arguing he wasn't trying to reject electoral votes when he voted to reject electoral votes. He was just raising awareness about constitutional issues, and he now accepts Biden's victory, he said.

Next act. Trump's former press secretary, Sarah Sanders, meanwhile, Trump's former press secretary, Sarah Sanders, meanwhile, is the first of his top former aides to announce her own campaign . She's running for the job once held by her dad, Arkansas governor.

Biden wasting no time naming officials to reverse Trump's immigration policies,"(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security, largely hollowed out over the last four years, is moving with urgency to staff agencies with people who had front row seats to the hardline immigration limits rolled out under former President Donald Trump, in order to rescind them .

The department -- the third largest in the US government -- was closely tied to Trump's immigration actions and will continue to play a critical role in the coming months and years as those policies are reversed. Over recent days, the department has started to hire staff with extensive backgrounds in immigrant rights, immigration law and refugee resettlement.

""It will have a substantial difference in the ability of the department to execute because people understand what's going on,"" said Peter Boogaard, communications director at FWD.us and a DHS official under President Barack Obama. ""The Trump administration weaponized the immigration system for four years. There's a clear understanding for many of these folks going back in what's at stake here.""

Ashley Tabaddor, for example, will serve at US Citizenship and Immigration Services as its top lawyer after nearly 16 years as an immigration judge and holding various positions at the Justice Department before that.

During the Trump administration, Tabaddor, in her capacity as the president of the immigration judges' union, was outspoken about the impact of Trump's policies -- like imposing case quotas, reversing rulings and curtailing judges' ability to exercise discretion in some cases -- on judges and immigrants.

President Joe Biden's administration has begun taking steps to shift the tone -- from restricting immigration to welcoming immigrants -- in its first few days. Shortly after taking office, Biden released a slew of immigration executive actions and orders, including reversing the travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, halting border wall construction and placing a 100-day pause on deportations.

Over the weekend, White House officials previewed more actions on the horizon, including creating a family reunification task force, addressing legal immigration and outlining a holistic approach to regional migration.

If confirmed, Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's pick for Homeland Security secretary, will be among those leading the charge. The Cuban-born Mayorkas was among Biden's earliest announced nominees and would be the first Latino and immigrant to serve at the helm of the department.

""The principles of homeland and security have been tremendously important in shaping my life. My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism and to provide me with the security, opportunity and pride that American citizenship brings to each of us,"" Mayorkas told lawmakers last week, drawing on his own immigrant background.

The Senate Homeland Security Committee will vote on Mayorkas' nomination on Tuesday. If he receives approval from the committee and then the Senate, Mayorkas will be flanked with staffers well versed in the abundant policy changes of the last four years.

David Shahoulian, who worked at DHS under the Obama administration, is assistant secretary for border security and immigration. Shahoulian also served as Democratic chief counsel of the House Judiciary Committee -- one of the key committees that obtained documents from the Trump administration about the controversial ""zero tolerance"" policy that resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant families.

He's joined by Adam Hunter , who serves as deputy assistant secretary on immigration for DHS. Hunter comes from the Refugee Council USA, a coalition of 29 nongovernmental agencies focused on refugee protection. Biden has committed to raising the ceiling for how many refugees can come to the US after years of historic lows.

Angela Kelley, who has an extensive background in immigration policy, is joining as senior counselor on immigration.

Early on, the makeup of the Biden-Harris transition team reviewing DHS signaled the incoming administration's awareness of those actions, with Ur Jaddou, former chief counsel at US Citizenship and Immigration Services, as the team lead. Jaddou is rumored to be filling the role of director at that agency.

""The Biden immigration team is stocked with seasoned professionals who understand the nuances of immigration enforcement,"" said John Sandweg, who served at DHS under Obama.

Sharmistha Das, who worked for then-Sen. Kamala Harris, is the deputy general counsel for DHS. Her name has since appeared on a document delaying a Trump regulation that would bar asylum seekers from countries with disease outbreaks.

Other familiar names in immigration circles, like Tyler Moran and Esther Olavarria, have also come to fill top roles. Moran, who also served under Obama and as senior policy adviser to then-Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, is now special assistant to the President for immigration for the Domestic Policy Council and playing a critical role in the administration's immigration legislative push.

Biden's agenda

During the US Conference of Mayors winter meeting Saturday, Olavarria and Moran previewed upcoming immigration actions. Olavarria cited a future executive order that would rescind Trump proclamations that had largely barred the admission of low-income immigrants.

""These are policies that ignored the decades -- and centuries, actually -- of contributions that immigrants have made to our economy, to our society, to our culture,"" Olavarria said. ""We'd rescind those policies and return to a country that welcomes immigrants and acknowledges their contributions.""

Another executive action would present a new vision for migration, like providing funding to address root causes of migration and standing up a refugee admissions program for Central Americans, according to Olavarria, who also nodded to actions that would put in place a ""fair but efficient asylum program"" on the US-Mexico border and restore the US refugee admissions program.

Moran stressed, however, that while Biden can make inroads on immigration policy through executive authority, it's still necessary to pass legislation.

""The President does have a lot of authority to fix the immigration system in a number of different ways,"" Moran said. ""But what really the President cannot do is provide permanent status to people, and we've made so many runs at this but we really have to get it done to make sure that people are on a path to citizenship."""
Chinese journalist who documented Wuhan coronavirus outbreak jailed for 4 years,"Hong Kong (CNN) An independent Chinese journalist who reported from Wuhan at the height of the initial coronavirus outbreak has been jailed for four years by a Shanghai court, her lawyer said Monday.

A former lawyer, Zhang traveled some 400 miles from Shanghai to Wuhan in early February to report on the pandemic and subsequent attempts to contain it, just as the authorities began reining in state-run and private Chinese media.

For more than three months, she documented snippets of life under lockdown in Wuhan and the harsh reality faced by its residents, from overflowing hospitals to empty shops . She posted her observations, photos and videos on Wechat, Twitter and YouTube -- the latter two of which are blocked in China.

Her postings came to an abrupt stop in mid-May, and she was later revealed to have been detained by police and brought back to Shanghai. According to Amnesty International, at one point during her detention Zhang went on hunger strike, during which time she was shackled and force fed, treatment the group said amounted to torture.

Her lawyer Zhang Keke, who visited Zhang earlier this month while she was in detention, described on social media that Zhang had a feeding tube attached to her nose and mouth. He said her hands were tied to prevent her from removing the device, and that she suffered from constant headache and pain in her stomach and throat.

CNN did not immediately receive a response from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on allegations of Zhang's mistreatment in detention.

Zhang's lawyer said she attended Monday's hearing in a wheelchair, as she had become frail during her time in detention.

In her indictment , prosecutors accused her of ""publishing large amounts of fake information"" and receiving interviews from overseas media outlets, including Radio Free Asia and the Epoch Times, to ""maliciously stir up the Wuhan Covid-19 epidemic situation.""

But Zhang's lawyer said the prosecutors did not display any concrete evidence of the ""fake information"" Zhang was accused of fabricating during the court proceedings. He added that his client, in a gesture of protest, barely spoke during the trial and refused to plead guilty.

Zhang is the first citizen journalist known to have been sentenced for her role in reporting on the coronavirus pandemic. But it is not her first run in with the authorities.

According to her indictment, she was twice detained for 10 days in 2019 for ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble,"" but the document did not specify what had resulted her detention.

In a statement on Twitter Monday, the British Embassy in Beijing said Zhang's case ""raises serious concerns about media freedom in China,"" adding that a British diplomat tried to attend her trial but was not allowed access.

The embassy said that Zhang ""is one of at least 47 journalists currently in detention in China. The whereabouts of other citizen journalists -- including Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin -- is unknown."" It urged China to ""release all those detained for their reporting.""

One of many

Zhang is one of a number of independent reporters who have been detained or disappeared in China since the beginning of the pandemic, as the authorities clamped down on coverage of the virus and propaganda outlets went into overdrive portraying Beijing's response as effective and timely.

""Under the guise of fighting the novel coronavirus, authorities in China have escalated suppression online by blocking independent reporting, information sharing, and critical comments on government responses,"" Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a Hong Kong-based group, said in a report earlier this year

China is the biggest jailer of journalists in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF) , and tightly controls the press at home while blocking most foreign media outlets via the Great Firewall, its vast online censorship and surveillance apparatus.

In March, China expelled journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, in an unprecedented move against the foreign press . Beijing said the move -- which came amid a wave of critical reporting about China's initial response to the coronavirus -- was a response for recent restrictions by Washington on how Chinese state media operates in the US.

While sporadic outbreaks have popped up and been swiftly suppressed with lockdowns and quarantines, China has largely controlled the virus, allowing the country to return to relative normality.

Restrictions on the press, however, have not lifted, and Chinese state media has begun aggressively pushing an alternative origin story for the pandemic, with claims the coronavirus may have been circulating outside of the country prior to the initial outbreak in Wuhan."
Europe threatens to restrict vaccine exports after AstraZeneca and Pfizer hit production problems,"London (CNN Business) The European Union is calling out vaccine makers AstraZeneca ( AZN ) and Pfizer ( PFE ) over delivery delays that could slow its recovery from the pandemic . Officials are even threatening to restrict exports and take legal action as anger mounts.

EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides on Monday expressed dissatisfaction on talks with AstraZeneca and said conversations would continue. She said the drugmaker ""intends to supply considerably fewer doses in the coming weeks than agreed and announced.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen turned up the heat on the pharmaceutical companies on Tuesday, saying the bloc ""means business.""

""Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines, to create a truly global common good. And now the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations,"" she said during a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum.

The European Union has devoted part of a €2.7 billion ($3.3 billion) emergency fund to assist with vaccine development. On top of that, it's spent billions to secure doses, though it declined to provide details on individual contracts.

EU countries counting on the vaccines to rein in the health crisis and jumpstart their economies are now being forced to modify their plans. Italian Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri told TV channel Rai 1 on Sunday that people over 80 years old would be vaccinated four weeks later than planned as a result of the delays. The country is threatening legal action against the drugmakers.

""By the [fall] we could vaccinate up to 45 million Italians, but I don't believe in these companies,"" Sileri said. ""I want to see the vaccines.""

Unexpected delays

The European Union has ordered 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which could be approved for use as soon as this week, with an option to purchase an additional 100 million.

The company said that production has been hampered by a manufacturing issue.

""While there is no scheduled delay to the start of shipments of our vaccine should we receive approval in Europe, initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain,"" AstraZeneca said in a statement. ""We will be supplying tens of millions of doses in February and March to the European Union, as we continue to ramp up production volumes.""

The news has sent the bloc reeling, just as it was racing to assess the impact of delays announced by Pfizer. The US company said on Jan. 15 that it would deliver fewer doses than planned last week while it upgraded its manufacturing facility in Puurs, Belgium.

The drugmaker said it would still be able to meet first quarter targets, and as a result of the changes to its Belgium plant would be able to churn out 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. That's up from the 1.3 billion it had originally estimated.

Pfizer said Monday it would return to its original schedule of deliveries for the European Union this week.

European governments are demanding answers, pointing out that the success of their vaccination efforts is dependent on the private sector.

""On the one hand we can only welcome the result of science, and on the other hand they have a monopoly and we are totally dependent,"" Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said on Saturday. ""There may be production issues, but these uncertainties and announcements make it very difficult to organize the campaign.""

Kyriakides said on Monday that the bloc would now demand ""full transparency concerning the export of vaccines"" from the European Union.

""In the future, all companies producing vaccines against Covid-19 in the EU will have to provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries. Humanitarian deliveries are of course not affected by this,"" she said on Twitter.

German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that the controls were not about putting the ""EU first"" but about making sure Europe got its fair share.

""In my view it makes sense that we have an export limit, meaning that vaccines which leave the European Union have a license so that we know what is being produced, what is leaving Europe, where it is leaving so that there is a fair distribution,"" he told German broadcaster ZDF.

How bad is it?

Supply chain experts are much more concerned by the news from AstraZeneca than Pfizer, given the latter company's commitment to increase output soon. AstraZeneca's vaccine, developed with Oxford University, is also much easier to distribute because it can be stored at higher temperatures than the Pfizer alternative.

A delay for a week or two ""is not a big problem,"" said Burak Kazaz, a professor of supply chain management at Syracuse University. ""[Though] I certainly understand that a delay means lives.""

The scope of the problems facing AstraZeneca, which appear more serious, would become clear in the coming weeks, he said.

Delays from both firms are a sign that there are still kinks in the supply chain that need to be ironed out as distribution ramps up, according to Prashant Yadav, a medical supply chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.

""We will have more of these ups and downs until we get to a stable process,"" Yadav said.

Given the rocky attempts to get up to speed — and concentration of production at just a few manufacturing sites — the public should expect monthly manufacturing capacity to fluctuate for the time being, he added.

Richard Wilding, a professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield University in England, noted that there are at least 50 items necessary to run vaccination sites, from alcohol wipes and syringes to personal protective equipment. Supply chains for those items need to run smoothly, too.

Crucially, the delays aren't just a problem for Europe.

""The price will be paid by developing countries who don't have access yet, because their deliveries may be delayed further down the line,"" Yadav said.

(CNN) The scramble for vaccines is getting ugly. The European Union, facing a shortfall in supply, is threatening to impose tighter export rules on vaccines.

The EU said drugmaker AstraZeneca had ""surprisingly"" cut down the number of doses it intends to supply to the bloc. Top EU officials did not mince words criticizing the company.

""The European Union has pre-financed the development of the vaccine and its production and wants to see the return,"" the European Commissioner for Health, Stella Kyriakides, said yesterday. The EU said AstraZeneca didn't provide sufficient explanations for the delays and is now demanding to know how many doses the company has produced, and who they've been sold to.

The company said that production had been hampered by a manufacturing issue . ""While there is no scheduled delay to the start of shipments of our vaccine should we receive approval in Europe, initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain,"" AstraZeneca said in a statement.

The delays are having a real impact in countries across the bloc. The Italian government was forced to revise its Covid-19 vaccination plan because of reduced vaccine supplies from both Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

Yet European countries and other rich nations are still on the winning side of the world's struggle to secure enough vaccines for everyone.

While US President Joe Biden said yesterday that he expects America to soon be vaccinating 1.5 million people a day , there are countries that haven't yet been able to secure any doses at all.

The vaccine rollout has shone a harsh light on global income disparities, and the Middle East is a microcosm of that problem . While oil-rich Gulf Arab nations were among the first in the world to receive a vaccine, war-torn countries such as Yemen and Syria must contend with vague timelines and complex distribution plans for the rollout, despite being among the worst affected by the virus.

Delayed access to vaccines will likely make this inequality worse, because countries that manage to get most of their populations immunized will be able to reopen their economies, while those at the back of the line will be stuck in perpetual lockdowns.

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.

Q: Is it true that vaccinated people can still get infected?

A: Yes, but the Yes, but the chances are very, very small . In trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were shown to be about 95% effective, which means some vaccinated people were still infected. That could be because it takes some time for the immunity to kick in. Also, no vaccine is 100% effective and the makers of coronavirus vaccines are still evaluating whether the shots protect against all infections, or just those that cause symptoms.

But there are some positive signs. New data from Israel show that only about 0.01% of 128,600 people who received two doses of Pfizer's vaccine tested positive for the coronavirus after their second shot -- and those patients had only a mild illness, according to preliminary data from an Israeli health care system.

UK fears it will take much longer to beat the new variant

People in the United Kingdom have been living under lockdown for the past three weeks, hoping their sacrifice would bring the country's latest coronavirus surge -- caused by the new, more contagious variant of the virus -- under control.

But despite the harsh restrictions, case numbers are not dropping as fast as experts have hoped. Deaths continue to rise and public health experts are starting to warn people that the country will be in this battle for the long run . The government is now considering further restrictions on travel to and from the UK , and is set to make an announcement later today regarding the use of hotel quarantine on travelers, according to vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi

Xi Jinping touts coronavirus cooperation as China persists with vaccine disinformation push

China has been praised for its ""vaccine diplomacy,"" promising shots to developing countries and investing in vaccine candidates that do not require expensive cold storage to be effective. But as questions have been raised over the effectiveness of one of those vaccines, the country's state media has reacted aggressively, targeting not just critics but also other vaccines, in an apparent effort to tear down their reputation in the name of defending the Chinese shots, James Griffiths reports

How one city missed warning after warning until its health system collapsed

Manaus, an isolated city at the core of the Brazilian rainforest, is witnessing its second coronavirus wave, a shock to the many who thought its first wave was so widespread that herd immunity must be the result. The healthcare system in the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Amazonas has now collapsed under pressure. This means waiting hours in line to buy an oxygen tank -- only to find there's none left. Or rushing from hospital to hospital with a sick spouse or parent -- only to find there are no beds available. Natalie Gallón and Marcia Reverdosa report.

A Disney World ticket booker alerted police to a domestic violence victim after taking their call,"(CNN) A Walt Disney World employee who took a call from a woman in Pennsylvania inquiring about booking tickets to the Florida resort on January 9 alerted police in central Pennsylvania that the woman may be dealing with a domestic violence situation at her home, police said.

During the call, the Disney employee heard the woman, who had initially called about booking ticket to the resort, scream ""get off me"" and ""get away from me,"" an affidavit from the York County Magisterial District court said.

The employee ""became concerned and sensed something was off"" when the woman started only answering ""yes"" or ""no"" questions and wouldn't go into detail about her current situation, according to the affidavit.

The affidavit says the Disney employee then asked the woman if she needed law enforcement to come to her home and if someone was hurting her, to which the woman responded ""yes"" to both questions.

Following the conversation with the woman, the employee called York County 911 and explained the situation, prompting a police response to the woman's home in Dover Township, Pennsylvania, the affidavit said.

"Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigns, in calculated move amid coronavirus crisis","Rome (CNN) Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte handed in his resignation on Tuesday, in a tactical political maneuver that he hopes will allow him to build a new coalition.

Italy was thrown into a fresh political crisis last week when Conte faced two confidence votes. He survived but lost his governing majority in the Senate after his predecessor, Matteo Renzi, withdrew his small Italia Viva party from the ruling coalition, citing frustrations with the government's management of the pandemic and a recession.

Conte handed his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, according to a presidential palace statement.

The President will begin consultations with the leaders of the country's main political parties on Wednesday afternoon, the statement said.

If Conte, who does not belong to a party, has enough support, Mattarella could ask him to form a new coalition.

China is rehearsing for when it overtakes America,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) China wants to lead the global recovery from the pandemic and become more influential on the world stage than ever before. It might just have the momentum — and the confidence — to pull that plan off.

The world's second largest economy shrugged off much of the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, and its ability to keep growing while the world crashed into recession could mean its GDP exceeds that of the United States later this decade, years earlier than expected.

""China emerged from the Covid-19 shock earlier than the rest of the world and authorities are already planning for the long term,"" wrote Françoise Huang, senior economist for Asia-Pacific at Euler Hermes, in a report last week titled, "" The world is moving East, fast .""

China just outpaced the United States in attracting foreign direct investment for the first time. And as 2020 was drawing to a close, it signed a trade agreement with the European Union with the aim of boosting growth and giving European companies greater access to its 1.4 billion consumers. Now, Beijing is starting the new year without one of its most aggressive political adversaries, former US President Donald Trump , breathing down its neck.

President Xi Jinping has already made it clear that he sees China taking pole position in the coming year and beyond.

reprising a message of the benefits of globalization he gave when he became the During the World Economic Forum's virtual ""Davos Agenda"" event on Monday, Xi struck a confident tone as he rattled off the ways in which his nation has sent help to other countries and pushed the world to work together,reprising a message of the benefits of globalization he gave when he became the first Chinese leader to appear in Davos in 2017

And he touted China's ability to propel the global economy by injecting ""more momentum into growth.""

China will ""leverage its big-market advantages and the potential of domestic demand to provide more opportunities for cooperation between countries and the global economic recovery,"" Xi said.

Xi was certainly projecting confidence, said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council.

But a host of geopolitical challenges — including clashes over Hong Kong and alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region — have exacerbated tensions with the West and may stymie efforts to foster multilateral cooperation.

""[Xi] is squandering China's global influence through increasingly provocative actions in Xinjiang, in Hong Kong, in the South China Sea, and with respect to Taiwan,"" Reinsch told CNN Business. ""These actions are unacceptable to democracies, and I think we will continue to see them pulling away from China despite its attractiveness as a market,"" he added.

'Confidence in China'

China responded with an Following allegations that it mishandled the initial crisis in Wuhan,China responded with an intense and unprecedented lockdown of the original epicenter that paralyzed city life for months. The strict measures appeared to work. While China is still battling some Covid-19 cases , its numbers aren't remotely near the levels recorded in Europe and the United States. Authorities were also able to reopen large sectors of the economy last year, even as other nations remained closed.

All told, harsh quarantine measures and additional actions intended to spur growth — the country also funded major infrastructure projects and offered cash handouts to citizens — helped China's economy expand 2.3% in 2020 while much of the world was mired in recession.

""In and out of lockdown ahead of everybody else, the Chinese economy powered ahead while much of the world was struggling to maintain balance,"" wrote Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC, in a report last week.

Given China's rapid growth over the last few decades, many economists were already predicting that it would overtake the United States some time after 2030. But the country's ability to weather the pandemic is accelerating that trend.

""The skilful management of the pandemic and the hits to long term growth in the West mean that China's relative economic performance has improved,"" researchers at the Centre for Economics and Business wrote in a December report . They now expect China to over take the United States five years earlier than previously forecast.

Chinese state media — often seen as a barometer of sentiment among senior officials — has been touting the country's economic success. The Global Times, a state-run tabloid, on Sunday seized on the report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development that showed China receiving more foreign direct investment than the United States last year.

""China has faced the US-initiated trade war and the country's strategic containment against China. But China has generally withstood the test,"" The Global Time's editorial board wrote . ""These all add to the outside world's confidence in China.""

The investment trend will likely flip back as the United States and Europe recover, according to Dan Blumenthal, the director of Asian studies at American Enterprise Institute.

""[Foreign] companies will be squeezed out over time by Chinese competitors and China's panoply of anti-competitive practices,"" he said. ""Still, given China's scale and ambition it is a formidable competitor to the US.""

Challenges ahead

China isn't without its challenges.

Economists stress that there are still threats to the country's future growth. The International Monetary Fund said in December that China's recovery has relied heavily on government support, while private spending hasn't kept up. Others note that a slew of bankruptcies and loan defaults at state-run firms have strained debt markets.

""The policy response to the Covid-19 pandemic, while effective in the short-run, is pushing more resources to inefficient state firms and will add to China's debt burden,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a research report last week.

Debt woes have followed China for years, casting a shadow over economic policy.

On Monday, a policymaker at the People's Bank of China expressed concern during a speech in Beijing that local governments were setting overly aggressive GDP targets. That heightened the risk of accumulating debt, given the relative ease with which the economy can be juiced by borrowing more money, said the official, Ma Jun.

Ma even suggested that Beijing should abandon nationwide GDP goals, and instead prioritize employment and controlling inflation.

There's another potential drag on China's growth in the years ahead. It has generally been trying to reduce its reliance on the West in recent years. (China's leading chipmaker, SMIC has been hobbled by recent US restrictions on its business, for example.)

That's related to a bigger concern for China. While President Joe Biden might strike a more nuanced tone with Beijing than Trump, they don't expect him to completely unwind the trade war , nor abandon efforts to reassert the United States as the world leader on economics and trade.

Biden ""has prioritized combatting Covid and restoring growth to our economy, but he is at heart a multilateralist,"" said Reinsch of CSIS. ""Once he has made progress on his domestic goals, he will turn his attention to global trade issues as well.""

Fauci says he worried Trump's disinfectant comment would make people 'start doing dangerous and foolish things',"Washington (CNN) Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said Monday evening he was extremely worried by former President Donald Trump's dangerous April suggestion that ingesting disinfectant could possibly be used to treat Covid-19.

""I just said, 'Oh my goodness gracious.' I could just see what's going to happen,"" Fauci told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""Out Front"" of Trump's suggestion.

""You're going to have people who hear that from the President and they're going to start doing dangerous and foolish things, which is the reason why, immediately, those of us who were not there said, 'This is something you should not do.' Be very explicit. The (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) came out, I think, the next day and put in one of their publications, 'Do not do this.'""

At an April White House news conference, Trump had mused about whether disinfectants could be used to treat the virus in humans -- asking whether there is ""a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning.""

He later falsely claimed he was being sarcastic and that he was prompting officials to look into the effect of disinfectant on hands -- not through ingestion or injection. But the comments prompted cleaning product companies and state health officials to issue warnings about the dangers of their ingestion.

"Dogs likely migrated to the Americas with humans over 15,000 years ago, study says","(CNN) Dogs have been following humans for thousands of years.

Archaeological and genetic data has revealed that dogs accompanied humans when they were migrating to the Americas from East Asia, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Dogs were likely domesticated over 23,000 years ago in Siberia, said lead study author and archaeologist Angela Perri, a research fellow at Durham University's department of archaeology in the United Kingdom. Her team analyzed the genetic makeup of ancient dog remains to estimate when the domestication from wolves to dogs happened.

Archaeological evidence showed that the humans migrated over 15,000 years ago from Northeast Asia across the Bering Land Bridge, a piece of land that connected modern-day Russia to Alaska. The land crossing no longer exists due to rising sea levels.

Perri studied the lineage of American dogs outside the Arctic, which come from a different genetic ancestor than Arctic dogs, and traced it back to ancient Siberian dogs. This lineage has shown that humans brought their dogs with them when they migrated to the Americas, according to the study.

McConnell allows Senate power-sharing deal to advance after fight with Democrats over filibuster,"(CNN) Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Monday that he will allow the 50-50 Senate to officially organize so Democrats can take control of key committees in the chamber after a weeklong battle with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer over the rights of the minority to stall legislation.

The breakthrough came as GOP leaders were eagerly looking for a way out of a potential crisis that would have stymied the Senate committee process indefinitely, after McConnell pointed to recent comments made by two Democratic senators about their long-standing opposition to gutting the filibuster as sufficient to ease his concerns.

Schumer for days had rejected the GOP leader's demands, saying Monday afternoon: ""We are not letting McConnell dictate how the Senate operates.""

On Monday evening, McConnell relented after two moderate Democratic senators -- who have long opposed gutting the filibuster -- reiterated their views, allowing him to argue that they were sufficient to resolve his concerns since Democrats would lack the votes to change the rules.

""With these assurances, I look forward to moving ahead with a power-sharing agreement modeled on that precedent,"" the Kentucky Republican said.

Yet McConnell didn't receive any written assurances from Democrats that they would never touch the filibuster, and Schumer's office argued that the GOP leader got little from the stalemate.

In response, Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman said in a statement: ""We're glad Senator McConnell threw in the towel and gave up on his ridiculous demand.""

McConnell's announcement is significant because the stalemate has prevented Senate committees from officially organizing, meaning Republicans still control key committees since the chamber is operating under the rules of the last Congress when the GOP was in charge.

Schumer has demanded that the Senate agree to the 2001 rules during the last 50-50 Senate when the chamber's committees had equal representation of both parties, and tie votes on legislation and nominations would go to the floor.

McConnell signaled Monday night he would agree to that as well.

It was clear GOP leaders were eager to find a way out of the logjam. After two moderate Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, reaffirmed their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, Republicans suggested that could be enough to pave a way for a deal -- even though the two Democrats have long held that view.

Sens. John Thune, the Republican whip, and Sen. John Cornyn, a member of GOP leadership, each told CNN that they believed those comments could be enough to avoid the logjam.

Cornyn called them ""promising commitments.""

""I know the pressure that Schumer is under by the crazies on his side,"" Cornyn said. ""I'm little more optimistic than I was Friday that it will be worked out."" The Texas Republican said that he also was concerned that if the fight over the power-sharing agreement drags out, Democrats may ""lose their minds"" and dismantle the filibuster to pass the resolution in order to let the chamber officially organize.

""That's not a good development for anybody -- not for the institution,"" he said.

Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said an agreement had to happen ""pretty soon"" because ""these committees are dysfunctional because they don't have chairman, ratios and all that stuff.""

He added: ""But if we could have a couple of Dems that would be willing to say something in a very public way and sort of sign a blood oath that they won't, I think that would help a lot.""

India farmers protest: Thousands storm New Delhi's Red Fort during tractor rally on Republic Day,"New Delhi (CNN) Thousands of Indian farmers protesting controversial agricultural reforms stormed New Delhi's historic Red Fort Tuesday, with others breaching barricades and clashing with police.

Protesters scaled the walls of the iconic monument and a flag was hoisted alongside India's national flag.

Tear gas and flash bangs could been seen on live streams from the city's streets as police moved to contain large crowds of protestors in tractors and on foot from breaking through barricades. Both police and protesters were spotted with large sticks in the streets.

One protestor, 30-year-old Navreet Singh, died when a tractor overturned during the protests near Delhi police headquarters, Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police said Wednesday.

Police also said that 86 officers were injured and 22 police complaints were registered against protestors for violation of lawful directions, rioting, damage to public property and assault on public servant with deadly weapons, in incidents that took place across the city.

It was supposed to be a massive but peaceful rally, as hundreds of thousands of farmers drove their tractors in convoy into the Indian capital as part of ongoing, nationwide protests against three farm laws that protesters say put their livelihoods at risk

Many of the farmers, who had adorned their tractors with colorful flags, including the flag of India and various farmers unions, had been camping out in protest on the outskirts of the capital for more than two months. Others, including young farmers from the northern states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan, had gathered on the border over the past few days in time for the planned march on India's Republic Day.

Protesters gather at the Red Fort in New Delhi during a demonstration against agricultural reforms in India, on January 26, 2021.

The national holiday marks the first time India's constitution went into effect in 1950 following independence from British colonial rule, and the day is annually celebrated with a huge military parade through the capital.

Farmers planned their march to coincide with the government's parade, which has been scaled back because of the coronavirus pandemic. But as tanks paraded before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , tractors driven by protesters ran across the capital -- some could be seen almost crushing police personnel standing in their way.

The massive protests have been a significant challenge to Modi as months of demonstrations and sit-ins across the country against his key agricultural policy have grown into a stalemate marked by deadlocked talks between farmers and his administration.

Protests turn violent

Police had given permission for the rally to proceed on certain routes but confrontations broke out when protesters diverged from the agreed plan. Police had had created diversions along several major highways and main roads in city and the metro shut exits at least 15 stations close to protest sites.

Tear gas and batons were used against protesters outside Delhi police headquarters and at two bordering areas of the city as farmers broke through barricades, protesters said Tuesday.

""Outside the Delhi police headquarters tear gas and batons were used, protestors also attacked the police buses stationed there,"" said Paramjeet Singh Katyal, a spokesperson for Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella group representing farmers' unions.

""We have broken the barricades, we have our tractors, people are marching, some leaders are also on horseback... thousands of farmers have already reached the capital,"" Katyal said.

Samyukt Kisan Morcha later called off the march in a statement, and denounced the ""anti-social elements"" which had ""infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement.""

The statement thanked farmers for their ""unprecedented participation"" in Tuesday's event, but expressed regret over the ""undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today"" and dissociated the group from ""those indulging in such acts.""

Farmer leaders said that the groups who engaged in violence and stormed the historic Red Fort to hoist a Sikh community flag, were not a part of the original movement.

At the Ghazipur border between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, police used tear gas and batons to push back about 2,000 protesters, and tear gas was also used at the Singhu border between Delhi and Haryana on Tuesday morning, according to Ashutosh Mishra, a spokesperson for All India Sangharsh Coordination Committee, one of the unions leading the protests.

Police placed a cap of 5,000 tractors to take part in the rally, according to Mishra. However more than 200,000 tractors were mobilized, with many young people coming from neighboring states, said Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union, one of several leading the protests.

Authorities blamed the farmers for flouting guidelines and resorting to violence. Delhi police spokesman Eish Singhal said that officers had ""showed a lot of restraint till the end but agitators defied the conditions and started their march before the scheduled time, and chose the path of violence and sabotage.""

Singhal added that in view of this it was necessary for Delhi Police to ""maintain law and order,"" adding that the clashes had damaged property and injured a number of police personnel.

Why farmers are protesting

For decades, the Indian government offered guaranteed prices to farmers for certain crops, providing long-term certainty that, in theory, allowed them to make investments for the next crop cycle. The new agricultural laws, first passed in September by Modi's government, instead allow farmers to sell their goods to anyone for any price -- giving them more freedom to do things such as sell directly to buyers and sell to other states.

But farmers argued that the new rules would leave them worse off by making it easier for corporations to exploit agricultural workers, and help big companies drive down prices. While farmers could sell crops at elevated prices if the demand is there, conversely, they could struggle to meet the minimum price in years when there is too much supply in the market.

The laws have been so contentious because agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India's 1.3 billion population, and farmers have been arguing for years to get the minimum guaranteed prices increased. They are the biggest voter block in the country -- making farming a central political issue.

More than 100,000 people have been protesting the laws since late November. There have been sit-ins lasting days along each of New Delhi's three borders. Farmers have blocked roads and set up makeshift camps, some sleeping on the road or in their tractors. They arrived from numerous different states to participate in the mass protests, at times clashing with police.

The government has held 11 rounds of talks with leaders of more than 30 farmers' unions that are opposed to the laws -- but the talks have gone nowhere."
Vaccine rollouts lay bare the Middle East's deep inequalities,"(CNN) Around the world, the vaccine rollout has shone a harsh light on global income disparities. Rich countries take the lion's share of inoculations, and poorer states scramble to have even the prospect of life after coronavirus.

The Middle East is a microcosm of that global problem.

While oil-rich Gulf Arab nations were among the first in the world to receive a vaccine, war-torn countries such as Yemen and Syria must contend with vague timelines and complex distribution plans for the rollout, despite being among the worst affected by the virus.

Gulf nations lead the way

The first Arab countries to begin vaccinating their citizens and residents were also the richest: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman.

The UAE stands out . The country of almost 10 million, which has one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world, also has one of the highest vaccination rates globally. More than 2 million residents and citizens have already been vaccinated using the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and China's Sinopharm vaccine.

The Gulf state has already vaccinated more people than middle-income Jordan plans to inoculate in the first phase of its roll out. Lebanon, currently in the throes of a financial meltdown , has not yet had any vaccines delivered.

The first Saudi citizen receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine in Riyadh in December 2020.

Regional states battered by war do not have concrete plans for procuring and distributing the vaccines even as international organizations step in to help.

Arnaud Bernaert, the head of global health and healthcare industries at the World Economic Forum (WEF), said the world shouldn't be ""naive"" about these inequities.

""High-income countries have political and legal reliability, which allows them to organize the fastest possible plans to protect their populations,"" he said. ""It will always be that way.""

""[Gulf Arab] countries have smaller populations, larger amounts of funds and strong health systems, so they're in a better position to start their rollout earlier, and that is a fact,"" Dr. Yvan Hutin, director of communicable diseases at the World Health Organization's (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, said.

""The Middle East is simply categorized by substantial inequity.""

For the non-Gulf Arab states, ridden with poverty, endemic corruption or conflict, the vaccination plans are complicated not just by poor administration, but by a deep distrust for the political leadership.

""You need to have a clear vision for the plan [to vaccinate a population], which requires strong governance as well as the capacity to pay,"" Hutin told CNN. ""Most countries in the region don't have either.""

A medic walks around the coronavirus ward at the Italian field hospital at the Lebanese University campus in the town of Hadath in September 2020.

In Lebanon, a ruling elite widely accused of corruption has for decades bled the country's resources dry, culminating in a financial downward spiral last year. The medical system has not been spared, and buckled under medicinal shortages and an exodus of health care workers. Last August's Beirut port explosion, which damaged some major hospitals, exacerbated what the country's president has called a full-fledged ""health state of emergency.""

Despite having some of the lowest case numbers in the region in the early months of the pandemic, Lebanon now leads the Arab world in cases per million population.

Two million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are expected to arrive in early February, but they are expected to only cover around 20% of the country's population. On Lebanon's streets, few people believe that the rollout is imminent, or that it will be conducted safely.

It's a similar story in Iraq and Jordan, countries suffering from economic turmoil and where people have regularly protested to demand political reform.

Jordan's free Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination program is already underway, but only a very small percentage of the population has signed up to receive it, citing an absence of trust, according to health officials. In Iraq, only 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will be available for its 40 million-strong population, despite the country having grappled with repeated surges in Covid cases over the last year.

But where governments falter, the international community says it's trying to fill in the gaps. WHO is organizing the distribution plans for middle to low-income countries through programs like the COVAX alliance, a global initiative with 190 participating nations aimed at working with manufacturers to provide countries worldwide with equitable access to vaccines.

People line up at a vaccination facility in Dubai's financial center district on January 24, 2021.

Bernaert says he expects a fast rollout despite the myriad challenges. ""Although there will be a lag in vaccinating lower-income countries against Covid-19, it will be far shorter than what we've seen in the past,"" he said.

Iran and Egypt are the two most populous countries in the region, with Iran at close to 85 million people and Egypt at over 100 million -- complicating distribution for two states that have struggled economically in recent years.

Egypt started vaccinating its people, starting with medical workers, with the Sinopharm shot on January 24. GAVI, the vaccine alliance that co-leads COVAX, will also supply inoculations for 20% of the population, while the Egyptian government said it has signed a deal for 20 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, covering an additional 10% of the North African state's inhabitants.

Buckling under sanctions imposed by former US President Donald Trump, Iran is the hardest-hit country by the virus in the region. It has had over 1 million cases and more than 50,000 deaths.

But Iran is the only regional state that says it plans to produce its own vaccine. Officials say the country also intends to import almost 2 million doses from India, Russia and China by the end of the first quarter of 2021. The imported vaccines will barely cover 2% of the population.

An elderly man receives a dose of the Sinopharm vaccine in Amman, Jordan, in January.

Conflict zones with a vague prospect of vaccines

In the region's conflict zones, governments are incapable of buying their own vaccines, or even distributing them in territories crisscrossed with armed factions and competing spheres of political control. They must almost completely rely on international organizations to do so.

COVAX has secured nearly 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to be distributed across all its participating 190 countries. But Hutin says that's not enough.

""We really wish we had more to give,"" he said. ""We're working on securing more doses, but it's just not going to happen tomorrow.""

Syria, already on its knees after almost a decade of civil war, is facing an economic crisis. The country's president, Bashar al-Assad, does not control all of its territory -- much of it was wrested from his regime by opposition groups during the conflict. The government in Damascus -- repeatedly accused of war crimes and human rights abuses -- will rely on GAVI, the vaccine alliance that co-leads COVAX. Opposition groups in Syria's largely Kurdish northeast, and rebel-controlled northwest will do the same.

In war-torn Yemen, suffering a devastating humanitarian crisis, rival governments in the country's south and north appear to have only a vague notion of what the vaccine rollout will look like.

Aden has seen its cemeteries rapidly expand as Yemen's Covid-19 death toll surged.

In Aden, the seat of the Saudi-backed government, Deputy Health Minister Dr. Ishraq Al-Subei said that Yemen may receive its first batch of the vaccine in March, but that shipment will cover only 20% of the country. It is unclear if this will include territories controlled by Houthi rebels, recently designated terrorists by the former Trump administration.

In Israel and the Palestinian territories, region-wide vaccine disparities also come into sharp focus. Israel's world-leading vaccination campaign, which is on course to meet the government's target of inoculating the entire country by the end of March, leaves at least 4.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza behind.

So far none have had the injections, and most are unlikely to get them any time soon -- because there is no Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the Palestinian territories.

According to United Nations experts, a policy of immunization that differentiates between those with Israeli IDs, and those without, is ""unacceptable.""

A UN expert report, published by the UN's Office High Commissioner for Human Rights in January, says that Israel is the occupying power in and over Gaza and the West Bank, and has been since 1967, and is thereby ultimately responsible for the health care of those living under occupation.

Israel disagrees, pointing to the Oslo accords, signed in the mid-1990s with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Included in the first of those agreements is a clause that hands responsibility to the PA for the health of all Palestinians under its civil administration.

Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told CNN: ""If we'll get to the situation where everyone in the country who wants to be vaccinated is vaccinated, we will be more than ready to share the vaccines with our neighbors.""

The Palestinian Authority health minister, Dr. Mai Al-Kaileh, says they expect to get hold of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of March, but that there is no specific date set yet for their arrival. The ministry says it has contracts with four companies producing the vaccine. These vaccines will cover 70% of the Palestinian population and the WHO will provide doses for a further 20%, the PA said in a January 9 statement.

'The beginning of a new era'

According to Hutin, the WHO has approached rich countries, including the Gulf nations, to share their doses, and that they have complied but that it's still a work in progress.

Abu Dhabi's Department of Health launched a local collaboration called the Hope Consortium, which is set to deliver 18 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021.

The undersecretary at the department, Jamal Mohamed Al Kabbi told CNN's Becky Anderson that the plan represents a complete supply chain solution to address and facilitate vaccine availability across the world.

Bernaert told CNN despite the delay in vaccinations in lower-income countries, he is more optimistic than he was a few months ago.

""Are we going to be able to vaccinate everyone in 2021? No, I don't think so. Is the vaccination tale going to continue in 2022, or even 2023? Yes, I think so. But what we've managed to do so far is a sign that we may be at the beginning of a new era."""
A judge has approved a $17 million settlement plan for sexual misconduct victims of Harvey Weinstein,"(CNN) A US bankruptcy judge has approved a Weinstein Company liquidation plan that allocates over $17 million for Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment and assault victims, an attorney for the Weinstein Company confirmed to CNN Monday.

""It is true that Judge (Mary) Walrath approved the settlement plan at a hearing today,"" Attorney Paul Zumbro said, adding that they are ""pleased with Judge Walrath's ruling, and particularly so given there is now a mechanism that allows victims to receive compensation without having to endure the hardships and uncertainties of litigation.""

CNN has reached out to Elizabeth A. Fegan, an attorney for the class action plaintiffs, for comment.

The Weinstein Company Holdings LLC and 54 affiliate companies previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2018 and were later sold to Lantern Capital, a Dallas-based private equity firm, for $310 million. The company also said at the time that it would release victims of, and witnesses to, Weinstein's alleged misconduct from any nondisclosure agreements.

The company's $35.2 million liquidation plan allocates $17,064,525.30 for the establishment of a ""Sexual Misconduct Claims Fund"" and a liquidation trust for the payment of sexual misconduct claims, according to court documents."
MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell has been banned from Twitter,"(CNN Business) Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, was banned from Twitter Monday night, according to a Twitter spokesperson.

Twitter made its decision based on a new policy it enacted after the Capitol insurrection whereby people who repeatedly share election misinformation can be permanently banned.

""The account you referenced has been permanently suspended due to repeated violations of our Civic Integrity Policy,"" the spokesperson told CNN.

It is not immediately clear which tweets led to Lindell's ban.

Bed Bath & Beyond stopped selling MyPillow products after Lindell voiced continued support for former President Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 insurrection and voicing false statements publicly about the validity of the election. Lindell, a major Republican donor, called the attack ""very peaceful"" and blamed ""undercover antifa that dressed as Trump people"" for the chaos, according to The New York Times . ""Donald Trump will be our president for the next four years,"" he said earlier this month.

Biden aims to tackle American's racial inequity crisis,"(CNN) If there was any doubt about the urgency of President Joe Biden's mission to tackle racial inequality, it was erased in the searing moment an insurrectionist rioter brazenly paraded the Confederate flag through the US Capitol .

Just 20 days on from one of the most shocking moments in modern US history, Biden on Tuesday made his most detailed policy moves yet on the issue with a series of executive orders on the one crisis haunting his presidency sure to endure once Covid-19 and its economic pain are just a horrible memory.

He said that the death of Minnesota man George Floyd, in a notorious instance of police brutality against Black Americans last year, had unleashed a common realization among citizens that they could no longer ignore systemic racism.

""Those eight minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd's life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around all over the world,"" Biden said. ""It was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn't be forgotten.""

Biden pressed ahead in the looming shadow of his predecessor Donald Trump after House Democrats on Monday delivered an article of impeachment relating to his role inciting the Capitol riot.

The uprising, incited by an ex-President who fueled white nationalism, underscored how America's oldest fault line is also one of its freshest following last summer's national racial reckoning.

Yet subsequent events have also left a sense that while the country has rarely been more divided since a Civil War that was fought over slavery, progress is possible and as necessary as ever.

In another striking image, on Monday, for example, the first Black, South Asian and female Vice President Kamala Harris swore in the first Black Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin . The two juxtaposed episodes less than three weeks apart encapsulated the nation's deep divides that Biden must confront but also a democracy's potential for change.

The President has picked the most diverse Cabinet in US history . He has instructed his nominees at the Justice Department to prioritize civil rights and to root out racism and prejudice to apply equality under the law for all Americans. This is no doubt heartfelt. But it is also smart political positioning since he owes his victory in the Democratic nominating race, his triumph over Trump and his party's capture of the Senate to Black voters especially.

""The President has committed the whole of our government to advance racial justice and equity for all,"" Susan Rice, the head of Biden's Domestic Policy Council said Tuesday, previewing a major address on race by the President later in the day.

""These aren't feel good policies, the evidence is clear -- investing in equity is good for economic growth and it creates jobs for all Americans,"" Rice said, previewing an agenda that is far broader than the most familiar racial issues, including policing and discrimination.

Biden tackled four areas on Tuesday, including fair housing, reforming the penal system to crack down on private prisons, recommitting the government to lifting up Native American communities and tribes and combating xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.

'A moving moment'

Biden has worked hard to meet the moment, after several clumsy or discordant remarks related to race earlier in his long political career.

During a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, during the election campaign, Biden argued that the nationwide tide of emotion that followed yet another shooting of a Black man by police, that paralyzed Jacob Blake, was the catalyst for a new effort to tackle all forms of racism and inequality of opportunity.

He also signaled understanding of the spirit of the resurgent racial justice movement by acknowledging that White Americans could never fully appreciate the historic pain felt by their Black compatriots, an experience shared by many other citizens.

""I can't understand what it's like to walk out the door or send my son out the door or my daughter and worry about just because they're Black they may not come back,"" Biden said.

Soaring words and symbolism are important -- they are part of a President's armory in mobilizing the public and affecting political change. But alone, they cannot transform a country or the lived reality of African Americans. The limited social mobility of millions and the busted promises of many previous ""conversations about race"" sometimes seem little changed from the reality noted by Martin Luther King Jr. in his book ""Where do we go from here: Chaos or Community"" that was first published in 1967.

""Loose and easy language about equality, resonant resolutions about brotherhood fall pleasantly on the ear, but for the Negro there is a credibility gap he cannot overlook,"" King wrote.

In a more recent lesson, the presidency of the first black commander in chief Barack Obama shows that the very act of breaking down barriers that at the time can seem epochal and irreversible can incite new prejudice and breed extremism.

What Biden plans to do

Biden's effort will require action from the Justice Department to tackle civil rights abuses and to guarantee fairness in the judicial system for all. Former national security adviser Rice's new White House job includes a sweeping mandate across all government agencies.

Biden is also soon expected to seek reforms on policing, partly in response to the death of Minnesota man George Floyd with a policeman's knee on his neck last year.

Last week, in the first hours of his presidency, Biden signed an executive order requiring all government departments to put racial and other forms of equality at the center of everything that they do during his term.

One established that ""advancing equity for all -- including people of color and others who have been historically underserved and marginalized -- is the responsibility of the whole of our government."" Biden also countermanded an earlier executive order signed by Trump.

Like much of Biden's presidency, his capacity for action, and to secure the massive funding that serious reform requires, will be constrained by narrow majorities in Congress and Washington's fractured political scene in the post-Trump era. But he does have the moral authority of having won office against a President who tore at the nation's racial chasm with a hard line ""law and order"" campaign based on false claims that the Democratic nominee wanted to dismantle policing as it is currently known.

Biden in the middle

The debate over what Biden has said is ""systemic"" racism in the criminal justice system puts the President between two absolutist positions. He finds himself confronted on his right by conservatives keen to demagogue him as anti-police and an enemy of White heartland values.

Conservative media has already accused Biden of wrongly equating every Trump voter with White nationalists and racists. And many Republicans are now seeking to draw false equivalence between the Trump-inspired violence on January 6 in Washington and clashes that broke out during Black Lives Matter protests last year. Biden has condemned violence in all cases. And violence that erupted in the summer in many cities was not the true expression of the attitude of millions of people who marched to protest racial injustice. The attack on the Capitol represented an unprecedented assault on another branch of government by a US President trying to steal an election.

To his left, Biden is confronted by progressives who want sweeping reform -- some of whom defined the term ""defund the police"" that many party leaders say helped cost Democrats victories in some key swing state races in the House.

This particular issue also pulls Biden between two versions of his own political persona. He was severely criticized for his role in 1990s criminal justice legislation that ushered in mandatory minimum sentences that sent many young Black men to jail for years. But he has also always had a strong relationship with the police and their unions during his long political career.

But the shocking events of last summer and the long litany of videotaped examples of police brutality against African Americans have irrevocably shifted the potency of race and policing in the Democratic Party. And Biden's positioning, though obviously sincere, is also enforced by political reality.

Still, some of Biden's longtime contacts in policing have told CNN that his experience and familiarity with both sides of this most difficult issue may uniquely equip him to oversee a policy response that goes some way to reconciling the extraordinary, and multi-racial national protests after Floyd's death."
Loyal dog waits for six days outside hospital for her owner,"(CNN) They say a dog is a man's best friend -- and that was definitely the case for one patient of a hospital in northeastern Turkey, whose loyal pet waited by the entrance for six days until he was discharged.

When Cemal Senturk was transferred by ambulance to Medical Park Hospital in Trabzon on January 14, his dog, Boncuk, escaped from their apartment and followed him to the facility, where she waited patiently each day.

Hospital staff informed Senturk's family about the whereabouts of his canine friend.

But after Boncuk was brought back home, she managed to escape again -- and returned to the hospital each day, Murat Ercan, the hospital's international patient center director, told CNN.

The hospital said Senturk's apartment was nearby, and that the family were not sure how the dog kept escaping.

"As China persists with vaccine disinformation push, Xi Jinping touts coronavirus cooperation","Hong Kong (CNN) Addressing the world's economic elite on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that ""containing the coronavirus is the most pressing task for the international community.""

In a speech to the World Economic Forum, Xi called for ""closer solidarity and cooperation, more information sharing, and a stronger global response,"" as well as ""international cooperation on Covid vaccines.""

China has been praised for its ""vaccine diplomacy,"" promising shots to developing countries and investing in vaccine candidates that do not require expensive cold storage to be effective. But as questions have been raised over the effectiveness of one of those vaccines, the country's state media has reacted aggressively, targeting not just critics but also other vaccines, in an apparent effort to tear down their reputation in the name of defending the Chinese shots

Along with hyping reports of deaths allegedly related to vaccines -- a dangerous game that could undermine not only confidence in the Pfizer and Moderna candidates targeted by Chinese media, but all coronavirus shots -- China's propaganda organs have also pushed alternate theories about the origins of the pandemic itself, including a long-debunked claim that it began in a US army lab.

""If the United States truly respects facts, it should open the biological lab at Fort Detrick (and) give more transparency to issues like its 200-plus overseas bio-labs,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said last week , adding that the US should invite World Health Organization (WHO) investigators ""to conduct origin-tracing"" as they are in China.

JUST WATCHED WHO and China criticized for slow Covid-19 responses Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WHO and China criticized for slow Covid-19 responses 02:34

Beijing has also pushed the idea that the virus could have entered the country on frozen food or other goods, despite most outside researchers disputing claims that it could be easily spread this way

Asked by CNN about her Fort Detrick comments, Hua claimed there was evidence that ""the epidemic broke out in multiple places earlier in the autumn of 2019 and there might be links between the seasonal influenza in the US and the epidemic,"" adding that it was ""not for China, but for the US, to offer the answers.""

Claims that the pandemic had ""multiple origins"" have not been supported by most scientists, and even if true, do not change the fact that the Chinese city of Wuhan was where the first major outbreak occurred, and where local officials were found to have downplayed the danger, allowing the virus to spread.

Wuhan remains the most likely origin of the pandemic itself, providing scientists with important data about how the virus evolved and what lessons we could draw from this for the future.

After months of delays and diplomatic wrangling, a WHO research team arrived in the city earlier this month to begin an investigation, bringing with them additional scrutiny, which seems to have prompted the sudden resurgence of the Fort Detrick conspiracies.

The WHO team has already said that they have no intention of assigning blame, nor is it necessarily their job to do so. However, any suggestion of uncertainty about the origins of the pandemic, or how the virus first began spreading, will likely be seized upon by Beijing to reinforce the alternative theories state media is already advancing.

New outbreaks of the virus in China itself, after months of having largely got the pandemic under control, also add to the urgency of deflecting blame outwards, particularly as cities are plunged back into lockdown and potential economic misery.

Xi has repeatedly emphasized the success of the Chinese Communist Party in tackling the pandemic, an achievement that is all the more striking when compared with the US and much of western Europe. As it rolls out vaccines both domestically and internationally, the chance of turning the coronavirus from a reputational disaster into a propaganda win must be all the more alluring.

But the promotion of vaccine disinformation could have major repercussions, not only in the US but also in China.

On Monday, Global Times, the state-backed tabloid which has led the charge on attacking the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines, used the death of a single patient in California to claim without evidence that the shots were dangerous. Health experts have said repeatedly that deaths will occur after vaccination -- especially in the early stages, when most people inoculated are elderly and sick -- but this does not mean they were caused by the shot itself.

Global Times even cited health authorities in Placer county, who it said reject ""the link between the person's death and the vaccine."" But this did not stop the paper using this as a peg to quote anonymous Chinese experts claiming mRNA shots were dangerous and ""may contain unknown risks.""

This reporting goes beyond attacking the specific Pfizer shot too, suggesting that the technology used to develop the newer mRNA vaccines is itself untrustworthy -- a claim that has no substance and could have repercussions for future Chinese products as well as the existing Pfizer/Moderna shots.

A medical worker waits at a nucleic acid testing centre at a hospital in the Daxing district of Beijing on January 22, 2021, after a partial lockdown was imposed on the Chinese capital.

Such reports are having an effect. Last week, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte pointed to reports -- heavily promoted by Chinese officials and state media -- of deaths in Norway, where the Pfizer vaccine is being distributed. Norwegian health authorities have said there was no correlation between receiving the Pfizer vaccine and increased risk of death among the 23 deceased patients who had previously received the shot.

""Almost everybody that I know is scrambling to buy this Pfizer (vaccine),"" Duterte said in addressing calls from some lawmakers to prioritize the US manufacturer's shots over Chinese vaccines. ""If you want to follow the experience of Norway, go ahead. Nobody would stop you.""

His comments were quickly picked up by Chinese media , feeding another round of disinformation.

Writing this week , Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China's success in tackling the pandemic at home may have left the country with a false sense of security when it comes to vaccines. Huang cited polling data showing that a surprising number of Chinese respondents cited ""not being enough at risk from Covid-19"" as a reason to refuse taking a shot, an unusual result even in countries where vaccine hesitancy is far more widespread than in China.

Similar sentiment could be behind the Chinese government's willingness to play fast and loose with vaccine misinformation. China has among the least vaccine hesitant populations in the world, according to a recent Nature study , and even if skepticism were to increase, the ability of an authoritarian state to force mass inoculation is not in doubt.

But as Xi himself noted Monday, vaccines are vital to the global pandemic response, indeed, this is why Beijing has invested in providing inoculations to developing countries. But such an effort will be undermined if, along with vaccines, China is also exporting misinformation and hesitancy."
Indian court rules that groping without removing clothes is not sexual assault,"(CNN) A court in India has ruled that groping a child through their clothing does not constitute sexual assault, drawing outrage across the country and frustrating campaigners battling to address widespread sexual abuse against women and children.

In a judgment last week, Bombay High Court judge Pushpa Ganediwala found that a 39-year-old man was not guilty of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl as he had not removed her clothes, meaning there was no skin-on-skin contact.

According to court documents, the man brought the child to his house on the pretext of giving her guava in December 2016. While there, he touched her chest and tried to remove her underwear, according to the judgment.

He was found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to three years in prison in a lower court, but then appealed to the High Court.

In her judgment on January 19, Justice Ganediwala found that his act ""would not fall in the definition of 'sexual assault,'"" which carries a minimum three year prison term which can be extended to five years."
"Alabama crews search for survivors after EF-3 tornado demolished homes, killing 1 and injuring dozens","(CNN) What used to be homes are now mangled piles of debris, with personal belongings strewn across lawns and streets.

That's the new reality near Birmingham, Alabama, after a ""large and extremely dangerous"" tornado late Monday night annihilated parts of Jefferson County.

The storm killed at least one person and injured dozens more, officials said. The twister also ripped a hotel apart and tore off part of a church's roof.

About 30 people in Fultondale were injured, the city's fire chief said Tuesday.

""Seventeen patients were tak(en) to the ER, with various injuries and some critical,"" Fire Chief Justin McKenzie said. At least 11 people were treated on the scene.

A young man, possibly a teen, was killed when he was trapped in the basement of his home, Fultondale Police Chief D.P. Smith said, according to AL.com

Several of his family members were critically injured, Smith said.

The family had taken shelter in the basement, but apparently a tree fell on the house and caused the home to collapse.

""They were doing what they were supposed to be doing,"" the police chief said, according to AL.com

Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Walter Gonsoulin said a ninth-grade student at Fultondale High School was killed in the tornado. He was 14.

""Out of respect for the family, we don't want to release too much information at this particular time,"" Gonsoulin said.

The superintendent said the storm caused significant damage to Fultondale High School, forcing it to close for the rest of the school year.

The tornado that struck Fultondale was an EF-3 with peak winds estimated at 150 mph, according to the National Weather Service. It was 500 yards across and traveled 9.5 miles.

Six people trapped in their homes were rescued Tuesday morning, McKenzie said.

Rescue teams are still sifting through a hotel that collapsed overnight after most primary structures were cleared out, the fire chief said.

Multiple homes were destroyed by a tornado in Fultondale, Alabama.

The tornado spawned from a line of storms among two large systems that have put more than 100 million people under winter weather alerts.

Tornado warnings and watches have expired in parts of Alabama and Georgia. But the same storm system is now expected to dump snow in states farther north.

Guests staying at the hotel escaped and sought shelter in a nearby restaurant when another line of storms came through, WVTM reported.

'We will have a long day ahead'

At 10:54 p.m. local time Monday, the National Weather Service Birmingham ""confirmed large and extremely dangerous tornado was located over Chalkville, or near Trussville, moving east at 50 mph.""

Early Tuesday morning, the NWS Birmingham tweeted it ""will inspect the damage to determine the strength of the tornado"" that impacted the Fultondale area.

A tornado tore through the Birmingham area Monday night, leaving significant damage.

The city of Center Point, about 13 miles northeast of Birmingham, also saw ""quite a bit of damage"" from the storm, Mayor Bobby Scott told CNN affiliate WBRC . About 16,000 people live there.

The back half of Hilldale Baptist Church's roof is missing, and the city's recreation center also suffered damage, Scott said.

""Looks like we will have a long day ahead,"" Scott said. ""Hopefully we can get everything covered up.""

There was a bit of good news, the mayor said: ""We don't have any injuries to report right now, so we're definitely grateful for that.""

The Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency urged people to stay out of the area as first responders try to reach the most damaged sites.

""On top of road dangers such as power lines and debris ... traffic is clogging the roads,"" the agency tweeted.

Eleven schools in the area will be closed for in-person and virtual learning Tuesday following the storm, the Jefferson County EMA tweeted.

Storm system expected to dump snow in other states

A tornado warning was issued Monday night for Jefferson County, Alabama, NWS Birmingham tweeted. The agency later issued tornado warnings and watches for several counties as the line of storms moved northeast through the state.

A line of storms brought severe weather from Alabama to Georgia.

The storm system is now expected to dump significant snow from the Central Plains to the mid-Atlantic Coast through Tuesday night.

Newsom shrugs off recall pressures as he lifts California's Covid restrictions,"""It's just complete utter nonsense,"" the Democrat said during a news conference Monday when asked whether the Republican-led recall launched last year had a bearing on the state's decision to end the orders, which have been in place since early December. ""Let's just dispense with that fundamental foundational nonsense.""

The lifting of the regional orders means that outdoor dining may resume, and hair and hair salons are permitted to reopen with very limited indoor capacity -- though many other indoor business activities will still be restricted as the state reverts to its color-coded tier-based system for assessing the threat by county. The vast majority of California counties are still within the most restrictive purple tier, and counties are permitted to impose stricter guidelines if they choose to do so.

""Today we can lay claim to seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel as it relates to case numbers,"" Newsom said Monday during an update on the crisis. He noted that the 14-day positivity rate in California has now dropped to 9.4%

""We are not out of the woods. We are seeing a flattening of the curve,"" he said. ""Everything that should be up is up. Everything that should be down is down. Case rates, positivity rates, hospitalizations, ICUs -- testing starting to go back up, as well as vaccination rates in this state -- but we are not out of the woods.""

Trump emoluments cases: Why the Supreme Court didn't want to hear them,"(CNN) Early in the Trump administration, a novel dispute arose concerning whether the President had violated the Constitution by illegally profiting from his business ventures while in public office.

It triggered a fierce debate about a provision of the Constitution that most lawyers knew little about and laymen couldn't pronounce: The Emoluments Clause.

But on Monday, with President Donald Trump no longer in office, the dispute fizzled. That's because the Supreme Court dismissed the two cases in front of it and wiped away appeals court opinions that went against the former President because he is no longer in office.

The court's action raises the question of how the justices will deal with a myriad of other lawsuits and disputes concerning the now-former President, and whether Trump's side may prevail simply because he ran out the clock and courts allowed him to do so.

One emoluments case was originally brought by lawyers for Washington, DC, and Maryland, who argued Trump violated the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign and domestic governments through the Trump International Hotel. Another was brought by various members of the hospitality industry who own or work in hotels and restaurants who argued they were also at a competitive disadvantage because Trump had not used a blind trust when he assumed the presidency but instead continued to retain an interest in his businesses.

"Covid-19 masks: Which mask is best for you, and when to use it","(CNN) Think of masks as the newest trendy accessory that can save your life -- and the lives of those you love.

But instead of what pattern, logo or slogan you display, choose your mask based on its effectiveness against the deadly coronavirus in the environment you are in.

Working closely with government agencies, industry stakeholders and ASTM International, an international technical standards organization, the standards will apply to filter efficiency, sizing and fit, cleaning and recommended period of use or reuse.

For now, here's a breakdown of respirators and masks based on current scientific knowledge, and what experts are saying on how to best use them.

N95-type masks

Made from fibers woven with an electrical charge that can trap errant particles -- like a sock that sticks to your pants in the dryer -- studies have shown N95-type respirators are currently at the top of the line when it comes to filtering large and small particles. Masks in this category are also known as ""filtering facepiece respirators"" or ""disposable respirators.""

What would happen if every American wore an N95-type mask for four weeks in risky settings like being indoors?

""It would stop the epidemic,"" Dr. Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta

N95 respirators come in many sizes to accommodate various face shapes. When fitted to the wearer's face and worn properly, N95-type masks can trap 95% of particles around 0.3 microns, studies have shown. SARS CoV-2 can be as small as 0.1 micron in diameter -- that's about 4 millionths of an inch.

While it may seem that N95 filters would miss the tiny Covid particles, that's not so. Most bits of virus exit the lungs encased inside larger respiratory droplets, typically much bigger than 0.3 microns.

JUST WATCHED See how a mask affects how a cough travels Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See how a mask affects how a cough travels 03:10

Even those that become aerosolized are easily captured. Due to a natural phenomenon called Brownian motion , such minute particles don't travel in straight lines. Instead they bounce around in a zigzag fashion and are easily caught in the N95's electrostatic filter.

""In a health care setting, there's an advantage because there's a degree of sophisticated training to inform people how to properly wear respirators which doesn't exist in a public setting,"" NPPTL's Szalajda said.

According to the CDC , a few other respirators also meet or exceed the 95% efficacy level: the N99, N100, R95, R99, R100, P95, P99 and P100 masks. Some of these devices -- which can look like gas masks -- have received an emergency use authorization and can be used in nonsurgical settings during shortages of N95 masks.

The N95 mask -- and its sisters and brothers -- is best fitted to a person's unique facial contours on a bare face to keep the seal tight. Then the mask must be worn properly, despite the fact that such high filtration can make breathing more difficult. N95-type masks have a much higher breathing resistance than simple surgical or fabric masks.

""I've seen people with a full beard wearing the N95, or they're wearing the 95 upside down, or they just have it over their mouth and not their nose and mouth because it's easier to breathe when you're not covering your nose,"" Szalajda said.

Note: Beware of N95 masks with exhalation valves in them, since those valves put your airflow back into the environment. Also beware of knockoff N95s being sold on the internet and at some commercial stores.

National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman arrives at the inauguration of US President-elect Joe Biden wearing two masks.

The CDC's NIOSH lists dozens of counterfeit masks being sold as N95 or NIOSH-approved masks on its website , and offers the following advice on how to be sure you are not buying a fraudulent product:

NIOSH-approved respirators carry an approval label on or within the packaging of the respirator and on the mask itself.

NIOSH-approved respirators will always have one of the following designations: N95, N99, N100, R95, R99, R100, P95, P99 or P100.

You can verify the approval number on the agency's equipment list or trusted-source page to determine if the respirator has been approved by NIOSH.

Europe's FFP2

In response to the spread of new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus, some European countries are mandating the use of FFP1 and FFP2 masks -- which stand for ""filtering facepiece respirator.""

Note: The ""P"" means the mask is strongly resistant to oil and can be used to protect against nonoily and oily aerosols. In comparison, the ""N"" on N95 means the mask is not resistant to oil and can't be used in an oil droplet environment (such as drilling for oil).

An FFP1 filter has a minimum filtration efficiency of 80%, an FFP2 is 94% effective and a FFP3 is 99% effective against airborne infectious diseases.

Last week the German state of Bavaria mandated that citizens use FFP2 masks when shopping in stores and traveling on public transport. The German government then followed that lead, requiring everyone in the country to wear either FFP1 or FFP2 masks while at work, in shops or traveling on public transport.

KN95 and similar filtering facepiece respirators

The KN95 masks, which are certified via Chinese standards, also filter out and capture 95% of 0.3 micron particles. But there are differences: Filter layers of N95 respirators were ""8-fold thicker and had 2-fold higher dipole charge density than that of KN95 respirators,"" a study published in Decembe r found.

The company 3M, which makes many filtering facepiece respirators, put out a document comparing N95 and European FFP2 respirators to the Chinese KN95, the Australia-New Zealand P2, the Korean 1st Class and the Japanese DS2 and found all of them ""similar"" in regard to ""filtering non-oil-based particles such as those resulting from wildfires, PM (small particle) 2.5 air pollution, volcanic eruptions, or bioaerosols (e.g. viruses).

""However, prior to selecting a respirator,"" the 3M document said, ""users should consult their local respiratory protection regulations and requirements or check with their local public health authorities for selection guidance.""

Surgical-grade masks

Designed to be used by surgeons and other health care professionals, surgical-grade masks are loose-fitting, disposable devices meant to ""help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose,"" according to the US Food and Drug Administration

President Joe Biden has often been seen wearing a surgical mask beneath a cloth one.

They do not ""filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures,"" the FDA stressed.

""Surgical masks weren't meant to perform the functions of the respirator,"" said NPPTL's Szalajda. ""They're not intended to be protection from inhalation particles but from contact with body fluids.""

True medical-grade masks are made of three layers of nonwoven fabric typically made from plastic. The colored top layer of fabric is made of medical-grade spunbond polypropylene, which is a resin polymer heat-bonded into a weblike structure.

Surgical masks also have small, bendable wires to help the mask stay in place, and are often tied behind the head or secured with ear ties. This design doesn't make for a particularly great fit, especially compared to the N95, according to Szalajda.

Surgical masks are one-time use only, and if they are soiled or breathing becomes difficult, the mask should be carefully discarded and replaced, the FDA said.

Homemade cloth masks

The most common mask in use among the general public today is a fabric mask, often homemade. Effectiveness depends on the type of fabric used and the number of layers of cloth. These masks can be as little as 26% effective.

According to the CDC, ""multiple layers of cloth with higher thread counts have demonstrated superior performance compared to single layers of cloth with lower thread counts, in some cases filtering nearly 50% of fine particles less than 1 micron.""

That's good news -- studies have detected SARS‐CoV‐2 in aerosols between 1 and 4 microns.

study published last September examined the ability of cotton, polyester and silk to repeal moisture when used in masks or as mask inserts.

""We found that silk face coverings repelled droplets in spray tests as well as disposable single-use surgical masks,"" the authors wrote, adding that silk masks ""can be more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are re-useable via cleaning.""

Shown here are different types (from left) of respiratory mask -- FFP1, FFP2, N95 and FFP3.

Whatever the fabric, look for a tight weave, according to studies . Use the light test to check the weave: If you can easily see the outline of the individual fibers when you hold up the mask to the light, it's not likely to be effective.

You can also add filters to your fabric mask, according to the CDC. Some are made from polypropylene, the plastic that produces static cling; others from silver or copper, which have antimicrobial properties. Studies on the effectiveness of inserts, however, are rare, so guidance is limited.

To up their odds, people have begun layering fabric masks over surgical ones for added protection.

President Joseph R. Biden has been seen wearing two masks on numerous occasions. On Inauguration Day, Transportation Secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten Glezman, took a selfie double-masking and inaugural poet Amanda Gorman wore a surgical mask beneath her Prada version.

It's a behavior advocated by Joseph Allen, an associate professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the school's Healthy Buildings program.

""A surgical mask with a cloth mask on top of it can get you over 91% removal efficiency for particles,"" Allen recently told Dr. Gupta's team

It makes good sense to double mask, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, now chief medical adviser to Biden.

""If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective and that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version of an N95."" Fauci told NBC's Savannah Guthrie.

But pay attention to fit on any mask, Allen told CNN last fall . ""You want the mask to go over the bridge of the nose, below the chin and be flush on the face, resting along the skin.""

Face shields, bandanas, gaiters, ski masks and scarves

Certain items fail to provide a sufficient barrier against Covid-19 and other viruses and should not be worn as a means of significant protection, according to the CDC

JUST WATCHED Researchers tested 14 types of masks. Here's what they learned Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Researchers tested 14 types of masks. Here's what they learned 03:19

Don't wear scarfs or knitted ski masks as a protective measure, the CDC says. Do not wear a face shield without a mask, the agency advises, as it won't protect against tiny airborne droplets that can float under and inside the shield. And forget bandanas and neck gaiters.

2020 study by Duke University looked at 14 commonly available face coverings. Not surprisingly, the fitted N95 was judged most effective, followed by three-layer surgical masks. But the study found folded bandanas, knitted masks and neck gaiters did not offer much protection at all.

In fact, gaiter masks, also known as neck fleeces, actually increased the transmission of respiratory droplets."
Sarah Sanders' run for Arkansas governor to test value of ties to Trump,"(CNN) Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday became the first of what could be a wave of Republicans from former President Donald Trump's inner circle to chart a political future, launching her bid for Arkansas governor.

The move positions Arkansas as a test of how engaged Trump, who publicly encouraged Sanders to run for governor, will be in his post-presidency in clashes over the direction of the Republican Party, as aides, allies and family members seek to carry on his legacy.

Through his Save America PAC, Trump announced his endorsement of his former press secretary Monday night.

""Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a warrior who will always fight for the people of Arkansas and do what is right, not what is politically correct. Sarah is strong on Borders, tough on Crime, and fully supports the Second Amendment and our great law enforcement officers,"" Trump said in the statement.

""She loves our Military and Veterans -- and her home state of Arkansas. Sarah will be a GREAT Governor, and she has my Complete and Total Endorsement!""

John Roberts ducks the spotlight by skipping the second Trump impeachment trial,"Washington (CNN) Chief Justice John Roberts has long been a student of history, but this is one part of history -- presiding at the second trial of Donald Trump -- he can do without.

Roberts apparently believes the Constitution offers him a reprieve from another ordeal with Trump, a man who challenged judicial integrity, declared he could get his way at the Supreme Court and then called the justices ""totally incompetent and weak"" when he failed to prevail.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an interview on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" on Monday that ""it was up to John Roberts whether he wanted to preside with a president who's no longer sitting. ... And he doesn't want to do it."" The New York Democrat noted that the Constitution appears to suggest ""the chief justice presides for a sitting president.""

The terms of the Constitution dictate that ""When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside."" And last year at this time, the robed Roberts sat high on the Senate dais for the trial of then-President Trump.

It was clearly his constitutional duty, although at some turns Roberts made plain that he did not find it a pleasant one. This time, the jurist who oversees a court that forbids cameras, who bristles at breaches of decorum and who strives to project a neutral image, will avoid the public scrutiny and role of referee at what is an inherently political affair.

Since the US House of Representatives impeached Trump on January 13, Roberts has declined multiple requests for comment on his responsibility, if any, for a trial after Trump left office on January 20.

Leahy had earlier said that ""the first choice"" for presiding officer would be the chief justice, and he would not reveal on Monday when it became clear that the duty would fall to him, telling reporters only that he was ""up to the responsibility.""

Roberts had no comment on Monday on Leahy's announcement of his role or dealings with senators.

Roberts' task last year was largely ministerial, but it had its dramatic moments. In one after-midnight episode, the chief justice warned dueling lawyers for the President and US House to stop attacking each other and respect Senate decorum.

He cited a 1905 Senate impeachment trial in which ""one of the managers used the word 'pettifogging,' and the presiding officer said the word ought not have been used."" Roberts wearily added, ""I don't think we need to aspire of that high a standard, but I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are.""

JUST WATCHED Chief Justice Roberts reveals if he would have broken a tie Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chief Justice Roberts reveals if he would have broken a tie 00:50

Then there was the question Roberts read aloud from Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren that began: ""At a time when large majorities of Americans have lost faith in government, does the fact that the chief justice is presiding [and] Republican senators have thus far refused to allow witnesses or evidence, contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the chief justice, the Supreme Court ... ?""

Such assertions aside, Roberts, a 2005 appointee of President George W. Bush, has tried to maintain public confidence in the high court and his leadership. He wants the nine justices to be seen as neutral, even as the six Republican appointees generally vote conservative and the three Democratic appointees generally vote liberal.

""We should celebrate our strong and independent judiciary, a key source of national unity and stability. But we should also remember that justice is not inevitable,"" Roberts wrote in his annual year-end report at the close of 2019, as he was headed for the first Senate trial of Trump.

Why Roberts can skip this trial

Only three presidents in American history have been impeached and subject to Senate trial. In addition to Trump in 2020, President Bill Clinton was tried in 1999 and President Andrew Johnson in 1868. All three were acquitted by the Senate; it takes a two-thirds vote to convict.

Never has a former president been impeached, although other former officials have been impeached and subject to Senate proceedings. The US House impeached Trump for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.

Although the relevant provision has never been tested, many scholars read the Constitution to require a presiding chief justice only for ""the President,"" that is, the sitting president.

They note that the framers designated the chief justice, rather than any senator or the vice president, who under the Constitution serves as the Senate president, to avoid a natural conflict of interest. If a sitting president were convicted and removed, the vice president would succeed him. No such situation would exist for a former president out of office.

Leahy, who has served in the Senate since 1975, vowed to ensure proper procedures were followed and reminded reporters that he has ""presided over hundreds of hours"" during his Senate tenure.

When Roberts ended the trial last year, on February 5, he said he had ""attempted to carry out ill-defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting,"" and he told senators he hoped that the next time he saw them would be ""under happier circumstances.""

For now, it will not involve Donald Trump.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referenced the Constitution's terms about the Senate trial. The passage reads, ""When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside."""
Why inclusive policy is a critical next step for diverse Biden administration,"Washington (CNN) On Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris ceremonially swore in President Joe Biden's defense secretary pick, retired Gen. Lloyd Austin , on a day that also saw the President reverse his predecessor's transgender military ban.

Together, the two events served as a potent reminder that the representation that Biden correctly seeks both matters and isn't everything . That is, representation, on its own, won't improve the lives of people whom society has long marginalized.

Policy is necessary, too.

The country's first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president swearing in the first Black American to run the Defense Department: It was hard to miss the magnitude of the imagery, which epitomized the record diversity of the Biden administration.

There's been no shortage of coverage of the value -- symbolic and substantive -- that Harris brings to her role as Biden's lieutenant, particularly given that the former California senator is expected to be the most powerful vice president in history

Meanwhile, Austin's elevation to defense secretary marks a moving turning point for an institution where people of color make up 43% of the 1.3 million service members on active duty in the US but are broadly absent from the military's top brass, according to The New York Times

""It is the uniform service that has long acted as a path of upward mobility for Black Americans, and the present day is no different,"" Bishop Garrison, the director of national security outreach at Human Rights First, wrote in December for Just Security . ""Even still, the most senior positions and ranks within the military remain elusive. Leaders such as Austin are unique in the fact that he has continuously navigated racial barriers successfully.""

At least as meaningful as representation: the kind of action that betters people's lives in a more tangible manner.

True to form, President Donald Trump had announced the ban in a series of tweets in July 2017, saying that transgender people would be prohibited from service ""in any capacity.""

The previous administration was known for scaling back hard-fought LGBTQ rights, as has been well documented

That Biden was widely expected to reverse the ban didn't diminish the moment's significance.

""This is reinstating a position that the previous commanders as well as the secretaries have supported,"" the President said on Monday, shortly before signing the executive order. ""And what I'm doing is enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform.""

Biden's words echoed Austin's.

""I truly believe, senator, that as I said in my opening statement, if you're fit and you're qualified to serve and you can maintain the standards, you should be allowed to serve,"" Austin said in his confirmation hearing on Friday.

In November, I argued that Biden's including transgender Americans in his victory address was momentous because the move brought with it the promise of LGBTQ equality under the new administration

Already, Biden has started to make good on that promise, offering representation, yes, but also much, much more."
Medieval bones tell a stark tale of hard work and physical trauma,"London (CNN) Social inequality was ""recorded on the bones"" of the medieval residents of Cambridge, England, a new study of hundreds of sets of human remains in the city has revealed.

Researchers studied the remains of more than 300 individuals from a variety of social backgrounds, buried in three different city cemeteries from the 10th to the 14th centuries.

The remains of numerous people were unearthed on the site of the Hospital of St. John the Evangelist.

The team from the University of Cambridge examined bones from a parish graveyard for working people, a charitable hospital where the ill and destitute were laid to rest, and a friary for the wealthy, detailing every break and fracture to create a barometer of social inequality.

X-ray analysis of the bones revealed varying levels of hardship -- accident, occupational injury or violence -- across the social spectrum.

Of the three sites, remains excavated at the Hospital of St. John the Evangelist -- a 12th-century house for the needy -- contained the fewest fractures. Many residents had skeletal evidence of chronic illnesses like tuberculosis, and would have been unable to work.

X-rays show butterfly fractures to both femurs of a man buried in the Augustinian friary.

Opinion: Why the Trump impeachment trial is crucial,"Frida Ghitis , ( @fridaghitis ) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) How does a country recover from four years of virulent acrimony? The urgent need to heal America's divisions, to ""end this uncivil war,"" stood at the center of President Joe Biden's stirring inaugural speech. He implored Americans to ""open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.""

The sentiment is not just lofty and moving, it is pragmatic and necessary. A country that cannot resolve its disagreements peacefully cannot succeed. A nation that cannot come together to tackle grave crises is inevitably destined to grow weaker.

But winged words, appeals to national unity and national greatness, however inspiring, do not erase the reality of a country so divided that not only have political leaders in Washington found it increasingly difficult to work together in a time of crisis, but across the land, family members and former friends have grown apart over political differences.

And now, a country with more urgent problems than it has front burners, is about to live through yet another jaw-clenching experience. With the House of Representatives formally delivering to the Senate the article of impeachment against former president Donald Trump on Monday evening , the clock starts ticking toward a February 9 trial sure to raise the temperature that only just started coming down after Trump, the chief stoker of flames, at last exited the stage.

All the while, new information about Trump's efforts to overturn the election continue to emerge. According to The New York Times , he considered replacing the acting attorney general with a Trump loyalist and using the Department of Justice to flip the election outcome in Georgia. He also, according to the Wall Street Journal , pressured the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate Biden's win.

Evidence of his unprecedented transgressions keeps mounting, and with this new information comes new questions: Are national reconciliation and a presidential impeachment trial mutually exclusive? Is the second Trump impeachment compatible with Biden's exhortation to healing?

In the short run, the impeachment trial is likely to intensify the very emotions Biden seeks to calm. But genuine reconciliation requires arriving at a common truth, a common reality. We cannot sing ""Kumbaya,"" or ""Amazing Grace,""and hope that our teary eyes are lastingly followed by soothed souls.

What America needs is a truth and reconciliation process, the method countries that went to war against themselves have used . But there's a reason truth comes before reconciliation.

Eventually, when Trump's hold on the Republican Party eases -- when all those who insist on perpetuating the big lie and defending a man who brought so many once-unthinkable calamities upon the nation either become weaker or tire of promoting lies -- the United States should set up a nonpartisan panel to preside over a national reckoning of what transpired over the past four years.

But we're not there yet. And the impeachment trial, which offers the possibility of beginning the process, is unlikely to offer that much needed national journey to a shared fact-based reality.

For now, too many in the Congress still defend the former president despite having witnessed firsthand far more than just the January 6 assault on the Capitol that was at least instigated by the president, or his monthslong effort to overturn an election that he reportedly acknowledged he lost within the privacy of the Oval Office.

Over the course of four years, the members of Congress and the American people watched a president drive a bulldozer through the fraying bonds that held the nation together. Remember his former defense secretary, James Mattis, denouncing Trump as a threat to the Constitution months before the election?

""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people,"" he lamented. ""He tries to divide us."" Trump had just used the military to crush a peaceful protest in order to stage a grotesque photo op.

During his presidency, Trump didn't just try to divide America, he attacked the foundations of the country, stoked extremism and cuddled neo-Nazis and racists. "" Very fine people ,"" he called people on both sides after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville during the first year of his presidency. And in his final weeks in office, he told his insurrectionist mob of supporters at the Capitol, "" We love you .""

Trump didn't just rend the nation asunder and he didn't just show his disdain for the Constitution and free press even before taking office with his verbal battering of the media, "" the enemy of the people ."" He did much more damage.

It is also likely that the five people who died at the Capitol on January 6 would be alive today if Trump had acted differently.

These are only some of the facts that Americans will eventually come to accept about his deadly, poisonous presidency. When that happens, when there's truth, there can be genuine reconciliation.

If there's an uncharacteristic upsurge of courage among Republicans, the Senate trial might surprise us and make progress toward that moment. But for now, some Republican leaders who briefly acknowledged reality about Trump's culpability in the Capitol riot are already backtracking . But the trial proceedings should illuminate the undeniable truth and eventually it will help us heal.

Impeachment managers should call witnesses, including fellow members of Congress who felt the threat of Trump's rampaging goons. It will also be important to hear from officials like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who can describe the pressure he felt from Trump's insistence that he ""find"" enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in his state, and others who were pressured or lost their jobs because of Trump's machinations. Above all, Americans should hear from those with direct knowledge of Trump's involvement in the coup attempt of January 6.

The trial will help establish the record for when willingness to face the truth arrives.

Until then, Biden will have to plant seeds of unity one by one, program by program, hoping that as he works to repair the devastation caused by Trump's destructive rule, he can strengthen American democracy enough to withstand the next assault, whether from Trump or from one of his acolytes.

Soaring speeches may soften some hardened hearts, but they're not enough to open everyone's eyes to unpleasant truths, or to stiffen the spines of politicians calculating what's best for them rather than for the country."
These entertainment industry workers are offering to help Biden with the Covid-19 vaccine rollout,"(CNN) Out-of-work backstage crews in the entertainment industry are volunteering to help in the fight against Covid-19.

In a letter addressed to President Joe Biden , the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), a labor union representing stagehands, riggers and other crafts people in the entertainment industry, offered the White House Covid-19 Response Team and FEMA its ""infrastructure and labor in the effort to build or convert vaccinations sites across the country.""

The IATSE represents roughly 145,000 entertainment workers who help make up the backbone of the film and entertainment industry. Their livelihoods were thrown into limbo last year when Hollywood studios were forced to halt production due to the pandemic.

""As you know, these workers have been unable to return to work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but they stand ready to do their part when they are called upon,"" IATSE President Matthew Loeb wrote in the letter, which the union shared on its Twitter account on Monday

IATSE entertainment workers have experience working behind-the-scenes in conference centers, arenas, theaters and other live events venues, he added.

""The skills required to convert these facilities are not much different than those required to load in rock and roll concerts and other live events,"" Loeb wrote.

This is also not the first time the union is offering to lend a hand. In April, Loeb said workers also helped convert facilities into field hospitals to help fight the pandemic.

""Together, we have a unique opportunity not only to help beat this virus and save lives, but also to get these skilled union technicians back to work,"" Loeb wrote. ""Let's build back better, together.""

Biden said Monday that he expects that the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day, raising the bar by roughly 500,000 more vaccinations than its target of 1 million per day in his first 100 days in office

The key factors in ramping up vaccinations are having enough vaccine, having enough syringes and other necessary equipment and having enough people administering them, Biden said."
Oklahoma lawmaker proposes a bill that calls for creation of a Bigfoot hunting season,"(CNN) Bigfoot may be a considered a myth -- but that's not stopping one Oklahoma lawmaker from proposing open season on the creature.

Rep. Justin Humphrey introduced the bill to the Oklahoma legislature earlier this month. The bill reads that the hunting season would be regulated by the Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Commission, which would set annual dates along with specific hunting licenses and fees.

""A lot of people don't believe in Bigfoot, but a lot of people do,"" Humphrey said in a news release.

He suggested that creating a hunting season for the creature could help draw in tourists.

""Tourism is one of the biggest attractions we have in my House district,"" Humphrey said. ""Establishing an actual hunting season and issuing licenses for people who want to hunt Bigfoot will just draw more people to our already beautiful part of the state. It will be a great way for people to enjoy our area and to have some fun.""

Biden tells CNN Trump's impeachment trial 'has to happen',"(CNN) President Joe Biden on Monday offered his most extensive comments since taking office on former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, telling CNN, ""I think it has to happen.""

Biden made the comment during a brief one-on-one interview with CNN in the halls of the West Wing. He acknowledged the effect it could have on his legislative agenda and Cabinet nominees but said there would be ""a worse effect if it didn't happen.""

Biden told CNN he believed the outcome would be different if Trump had six months left in his term, but said he doesn't think 17 Republican senators will vote to convict Trump.

""The Senate has changed since I was there, but it hasn't changed that much,"" Biden said.

His comments came the same night the House impeachment managers formally triggered the start of Trump's second impeachment trial after they walked across the Capitol and began reading on the Senate floor the charge against Trump, the first president in history to be impeached twice.

Trump impeachment: House delivers article to Senate on Monday triggering only 4th such trial in US history,"(CNN) The House impeachment managers formally triggered the start of former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial Monday evening after they walked across the Capitol and delivered to the Senate the charge against Trump , the first president in history to be impeached twice.

Wearing black masks and walking two-by-two through the very halls where rioters had overtaken the Capitol earlier this month in a deadly siege , the impeachment managers were led into the Senate chamber by the lead impeachment manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who read the article of impeachment.

The contours of Trump's Senate trial are starting to take shape as the ceremonial elements got underway, with the Senate's longest-serving Democrat expected to preside over the trial and Democrats still weighing whether to pursue witnesses during proceedings that could take up a chunk of February.

Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding like he did for Trump's first impeachment trial, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Instead, Sen. Patrick Leahy, the president pro tempore of the Senate, is expected to preside, the sources said. The Constitution says the chief justice presides when the person facing trial is the current president of the United States, but senators preside in other cases, one source said.

As the fourth Senate impeachment trial of a president in US history gets underway, there are still two big questions looming over the Democrats' impeachment case: Whether they will seek witnesses and how long the trial will take. The answers to both are still not known yet, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.

But if the House impeachment managers seek witnesses, they want them to be cooperative, rather than threaten to fight in court over executive privilege, a snag that hampered Democrats' efforts to seek witnesses the first time around.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer did not answer Monday whether he was open to having witnesses appear as part of Trump's impeachment trial, saying that ""hopefully"" Democrats would be able to negotiate with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on the structure of proceedings.

""We'll see what happens. We don't know what the requests are on either side yet, of the managers or the defense,"" the New York Democrat said.

Trump is still working on filling out his legal team, and one lawyer who had been approached declined to join on Monday. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he spoke to Trump on Sunday while the former President was golfing in Florida.

Asked about Trump's mindset and preparations ahead of his second impeachment trial, Graham said, ""Well, I think he'd like to get it over with."" Graham said he ""wouldn't think"" Trump would come back from Florida for the proceedings, again emphasizing the desire for a quick trial.

The exact time frame of the trial itself, which will begin the week of February 8, is also unknown, but multiple impeachment managers have said they don't think it will go as long as the 21 days of Trump's trial in 2020. The expectation is still, however, that it will take up much of February and wrap up by month's end, if not sooner.

While the delivery of the impeachment article kicked off the trial Monday evening, though the substance of the arguments are still two weeks away, while the Senate turns back to confirming President Joe Biden's Cabinet and potentially taking up the President's Covid-19 relief package.

As the managers lined up to walk to the Senate, Raskin turned around to face the other impeachment managers, patted his chest and said, ""Proud of you guys.""

Leahy to preside over trial

The likelihood that Leahy will oversee the trial has raised questions about whether he will also be eligible to vote, but constitutional experts say that nothing would stop him from doing so.

""He's a sitting senator, he still gets to vote. Nothing in the Constitution would preclude him from voting,"" said Frank Bowman, a University of Missouri law professor who has written extensively about impeachment.

Leahy told reporters Monday that he's ""up to the responsibility"" of presiding, and his role will be to make sure ""the procedures are followed.""

""I'm not presenting the evidence, I'm making sure the procedures are followed,"" Leahy said when asked about being a frequent critic of the former President. ""I don't think there's any senator who over the 40-plus years I've been here would say I'm anything but impartial in ruling on procedure.""

The Vermont Democrat declined to say when the decision was made that he would preside over the Senate trial. Asked Monday if Roberts had turned down an invitation to preside, Leahy said: ""You can ask the chief justice that.""

Roberts, however, declined to comment. ""The chief justice has no comment,"" Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said.

Senators to be sworn in Tuesday

The scheduling leading up to the trial's arguments was resolved Friday after a week's worth of uncertainty over when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would send the article to the Senate, thanks to a deal reached between Senate leaders.

Under the agreement, Trump's legal team and the House managers will have two weeks to exchange pre-trial briefs before arguments begin. Senators will be sworn in as jurors on Tuesday.

The deal gives something to both Schumer and McConnell, who are still at odds over a power-sharing agreement in the 50-50 Senate.

The schedule gives Trump's legal team time to prepare for the trial. Trump is still working to assemble a full legal team, people familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday, even as he has begun to craft a defense strategy with Butch Bowers, the South Carolina lawyer who has agreed to represent him in the historic proceedings.

Bowers, a respected lawyer from Columbia, South Carolina, who once worked in the Justice Department under President George W. Bush, has been in conversation with Trump in recent days, according to two people familiar with the matter. Bowers was connected to Trump by Graham, who is also helping to add new lawyers to the team.

Charlie Condon, a former South Carolina attorney general, has been approached about joining the legal team, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. In a brief statement to CNN on Monday evening, Condon wrote: ""I am not representing former President Trump. Thanks.""

For Schumer and the Biden administration, the two-week break allows for more of Biden's Cabinet to be confirmed , as all other Senate business will stop once the trial gets underway, after Republicans rejected agreeing to split the Senate's days.

Biden told CNN on Monday that the impeachment trial ""has to happen,"" in his most extensive remarks on the matter since Trump was impeached earlier this month.

Republicans make a constitutional argument

Republicans increasingly believe there's virtually no path to Trump's conviction in the Senate, which would require 17 GOP members to join with Democrats for a two-thirds vote. They've argued both that the trial itself is unconstitutional because Trump is no longer President -- legal scholars disagree , though there's no precedent -- and that pushing forward with impeachment now is divisive.

""I think it's time to move on from this impeachment trial,"" said Sen. Roger Marshall, the newly elected Republican from Kansas. ""The impeachment trial is unconstitutional.""

But Democrats argue there has to be accountability for the former President after he incited the rioters who ransacked the Capitol on January 6 in an effort to stop Congress from enacting a peaceful transfer of power.

""It makes no sense whatsoever that a president or any official could commit a heinous crime against our country and then defeat Congress' impeachment powers by simply resigning, so as to avoid accountability and a vote to disqualify them from future office,"" Schumer said Monday.

Ten House Republicans voted to impeach Trump when the House voted earlier this month to charge him with a single article, incitement of insurrection. A handful of Senate Republicans are likely to vote to convict him, too, even if it's short of the number required to convict him and bar him from running for office again.

""I believe that what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense. If not, what is?"" Romney said of Trump's actions inciting the pro-Trump mob that attacked the Capitol.

"New variant of coronavirus called P.1 detected in US for first time, officials say","A new variant of coronavirus that worries health officials has been detected in the United States for the first time, officials in Minnesota said Monday. They said they had detected the P.1 variant of coronavirus in a traveler from Brazil.

P.1 is one of four variants being closely watched by officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Until Monday, it had only been reported in Brazil and among a group of four travelers from Brazil to Japan.

“The variant was found through the MDH’s variant surveillance program. Each week this program collects 50 random samples from the University of Minnesota clinical laboratories, Infinity Biologix Laboratory in Oakdale, and other testing partners and then conducts special testing using a process called whole genome sequencing,” the Minnesota Department of Health said in a statement.

The P.1 variant carries a pattern of mutations that appears to make the virus more easily transmitted.

“The emergence of this variant raises concerns of a potential increase in transmissibility or propensity for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection of individuals,” the CDC says on its website.

It’s been the most common variant of the virus detected in a surge of cases seen in and around Manaus, the largest city in Brazil’s Amazon region.

There’s no evidence it causes more severe disease, however.

“One of the reasons we are able to detect those variants of concern in Minnesota so quickly is that we have one of the best public health laboratory surveillance systems in the US,” Minnesota Commissioner of Health Jan Malcolm said in a statement."
Biden raises the bar on vaccines and suggests US will get to 1.5 million a day,"(CNN) President Joe Biden said Monday that he expects that the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day, raising the bar by roughly 500,000 more vaccinations than its target of 1 million per day in his first 100 days in office. He said that the US could surpass that initial target in about three weeks.

""I'm quite confident that we will be in a position within the next three weeks or so to be vaccinating people at the range of 1 million a day or in excess of that,"" he told reporters, clarifying that he was referring to 100 million shots, not necessarily 100 million people, since some of the vaccines require more than one shot.

Biden said the key factors in ramping up vaccinations are having enough vaccine, having enough syringes and other necessary equipment and having enough people administering them. He said his administration is working to produce additional vaccinators -- people who can administer the vaccine.

""I think with the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbor and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day,"" he said.

Soon after Biden's briefing, a White House official told CNN that the administration's official goal still remains 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days in office.

Army confirms thousands of National Guard troops will remain in Washington into March,"(CNN) More than 5,000 National Guard troops will remain in Washington through mid-March to provide security amid concerns over potential unrest in the coming weeks, acting Secretary of the Army John Whitley said in a press briefing on Monday.

There are currently 15,000 troops in the city with the numbers due to be reduced to 7,000 by the end of the week and 5,600 by mid-March, according to National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Daniel Hokanson.

Five hundred members will support the US Park Police and 550 members will support the Metropolitan Police Department over the next two weeks. Another 5,000 will continue supporting Capitol Police and 600 will support the US Secret Service through mid-March, Whitley said.

""There are several upcoming events -- we don't know what they are -- over the next several weeks, and they're concerned that there could be situations where there are lawful protests, First Amendment-protected protests, that could either be used by malicious actors, or other problems that could emerge,"" Whitley said.

As CNN previously reported , 25,000 National Guard troops were brought to Washington to help secure the city through President Joe Biden's inauguration following the deadly riot at the US Capitol earlier in the month. And discussions had been taking place to keep thousands of troops in the district until March because of concerns about potential unrest during the upcoming impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump and around Biden's first joint address to Congress.

US Covid aid: Here's when you'll see help from federal government,"(CNN) There's lots of talk of all the federal assistance going to Americans and small businesses in need. But while some is already approved, not all of it is out the door yet -- and some of it is still just at the proposal stage.

What's already in many people's bank accounts or on the way is money from the $900 billion relief deal Congress passed in December. It included a new round of stimulus checks, beefed-up unemployment benefits, additional housing and nutrition assistance and money to fight the coronavirus.

But Biden is pushing Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion package with even more funding for those measures -- including $1,400 in additional stimulus cash -- as well as other provisions to help needy Americans. Some Democrats want his package to be even more generous, while Republicans are balking at the increased spending. It's not clear when a deal might get done or what a final version will look like.

Here's what you can expect to see, and when.

Stimulus checks

Lawmakers agreed last month to send $600 stimulus checks to individuals earning less than $75,000 a year and double that to married couples making less than $150,000 annually. They are also getting $600 per child under the age of 17. The payments phase out for people making more money.

More than 100 millions Americans have already received the payments via direct deposit, as of January 8, according to the Internal Revenue Service's most recent data. The payments started going out on December 29 and were scheduled to continue being sent through January 15. Those eligible who don't automatically receive the money will have to claim it on their 2020 tax returns, according to the agency.

The President also wants to help those who never got the original $1,200 checks that Congress approved last spring. He signed an executive order Friday that directs the Treasury Department to consider taking a series of actions to reach the estimated 8 million people who may miss out on their stimulus payments because they don't normally file taxes.

Meanwhile, Biden wants to send Americans an additional $1,400 , for a total of $2,000, as part of his massive relief package. The new payments would also go to adult dependents who were left out of the earlier rounds, like some children over the age of 17.

However, it will be a while before anyone sees those funds -- if they ever do. The plan must first make its way through Congress, where opposition is already forming

Unemployment benefits

Laid-off workers will receive $300 weekly boosts to their jobless payments through mid-March, thanks to Congress' December package.

The deal also extended two key pandemic jobless programs -- providing 11 more weeks of payments to freelancers, independent contractors, the self-employed and certain people affected by the pandemic, as well as to those who exhausted their regular state benefits.

Many states have already implemented these provisions, though some are continuing to program the changes into their systems. Those who exhausted their benefits before the end of December typically have to wait the longest to restart receiving payments.

As part of his relief proposal, Biden wants to increase the federal enhancement to $400 a week and extend it and the pandemic programs through September.

Housing assistance

Congress extended eviction protection until the end of this month and provided $25 billion in rental assistance for individuals who lost their sources of income during the pandemic.

The President took action on his first day in office to help struggling homeowners and renters. He signed an executive order that called on several federal departments and agencies to extend their bans on evictions and foreclosures for those affected by the coronavirus until at least the end of March.

Biden's relief proposal calls for giving an additional $25 billion in rental assistance to low- and moderate-income households. Another $5 billion would be set aside to help struggling renters pay their utility bills. Biden is also calling for $5 billion to help states and localities assist those at risk of experiencing homelessness.

The plan would extend the federal eviction moratorium to September 30, as well as allow people with federally guaranteed mortgages to apply for forbearance until that date.

Nutrition aid

The December deal raised SNAP benefits by 15% for six months but did not expand eligibility for food stamps.

It also expanded the Pandemic-EBT program to families with children under age 6 who receive food stamps, deeming them ""enrolled"" in child care and eligible for benefits. The program provides money to low-income families in lieu of the free and reduced-price meals that children would have received in school.

The package sent $400 million to food banks and food pantries through The Emergency Food Assistance Program. And it provided $175 million for nutrition services for seniors, such as Meals on Wheels, and $13 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which serves more than 700,000 older Americans monthly.

As part of his $1.9 trillion plan, Biden would extend the 15% increase in food stamp benefits through September, instead of having it expire in June. He would invest another $3 billion to help women, infants and children secure food, and would give US territories $1 billion in nutrition assistance. And he would partner with restaurants to provide food to needy Americans and jobs to laid-off restaurant workers.

Biden took action to bolster nutrition assistance in his first week in office. He signed an executive order Friday calling for the Department of Agriculture to consider enhancing Pandemic-EBT benefits by 15%, which would give a family with three children more than $100 in additional support every two months.

Also, the order directs the department to consider allowing states to boost food stamp benefits for about 12 million Americans who did not benefit from an earlier increase in emergency allotments included in the congressional relief packages. The order would bump up benefits for a family of four by 15% to 20% per month.

Paid emergency leave

Congress' package did not extend the paid sick and family leave benefits that lawmakers had approved in March.

Biden's relief proposal would reinstate that provision, which expired at the end of last year, until September 30. Also, it would broaden the benefits to workers excluded from the original program, including those employed at businesses with more than 500 employees and fewer than 50, as well as federal workers who didn't qualify.

Also, he is calling for people who are sick or quarantining, or caring for children whose schools are closed, to receive 14 weeks of paid leave. The government would reimburse employers with fewer than 500 workers for the full cost of providing the leave.

Enhanced tax credits

As part of his $1.9 trillion plan, Biden would boost the child tax credit to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for those between ages 6 and 17 for a year. The credit could be paid monthly and would be made fully refundable.

Democratic lawmakers have already started drafting legislation on this measure.

The President also proposes raising the maximum earned income tax credit for a year to nearly $1,500 for childless adults, increasing the income limit for the credit to about $21,000 and broadening the age range of eligibility to cover older workers.

And he is calling for expanding the child care tax credit for one year so that families will get back as much as half of their spending on child care for children under age 13.

Student loans

One of the executive orders Biden signed on his first day directed the Department of Education to extend the suspension of federal student loan payments and interest. Borrowers will not have to make payments until October 1 at the earliest, extending the already unprecedented pause on payments by eight months.

Small business funding

The government restarted approving loans on January 11 and made 60,000 during the first week, when it provided exclusive access to small lenders in underserved communities that had trouble accessing the program last year.

The second loans are limited to those with fewer than 300 employees that have seen drops of at least 25% of their revenue during the first, second or third quarter of 2020. The amount a borrower can receive is reduced from $10 million to $2 million, but businesses have more flexibility on how they can spend the money. Lawmakers also simplified the forgiveness process for loans under $150,000.

Congress carved out $12 billion for minority-owned businesses and expanded eligibility to more nonprofits, as well as local newspapers, TV and radio broadcasters.

Biden's package would provide $15 billion to create a new grant program for small business owners, separate from the Paycheck Protection Program

He also proposes investing $35 billion in some state, local, tribal and nonprofit financing programs that make low-interest loans and provide venture capital to entrepreneurs.

$15 hourly minimum wage

Among the most controversial measures in Biden's $1.9 trillion plan is his call to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and to end the tipped minimum wage and the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities.

He's already started laying the groundwork for this in the federal government. His executive order on Friday sets the stage for requiring contractors to pay a $15 hourly minimum wage and to provide emergency paid leave by the end of his first 100 days. It also directs agencies to determine which federal workers are earning less than that minimum and develop recommendations to promote bringing them up to $15 an hour.

Currently, the national minimum wage is $7.25 an hour."

Twitter bets on crowdsourcing to help combat misinformation,"(CNN Business) Twitter on Monday launched Birdwatch, an experiment that relies on the social network's users to provide context to tweets and to combat misinformation.

Twitter TWTR The tool, whichdescribed as a community-driven pilot project, allows participating users in the United States to create ""notes"" for a given tweet that will exist for now on a separate part of Twitter's website. Notes that contribute to a consensus on whether a post is misleading may ""eventually"" be shown directly on tweets, the company said in a blog post

Twitter did not say, however, whether tweets that receive notes may lead to removal or other consequences; the intent behind the tool, it said, is for users to be able to respond quickly to a fast-spreading claim.

Birdwatch's approach flips Twitter's existing model of moderation, in which Twitter itself labels content. It also places more power (or burden, potentially) in the hands of users, much in the way Wikipedia or reddit are platforms whose communities are self-governed by users.

Twitter users have played a role before in flagging potentially problematic tweets to the company, but this move makes users even more involved in the content moderation process.

"'I still have trouble with it': One year on, Lakers stars struggle to come to terms with Kobe Bryant's death","(CNN) ""Man, it's a saying that time heals all,"" LeBron James said following the Los Angeles Lakers' win over Chicago on Saturday.

Still, one year on from Kobe Bryant's sudden death , those inside the Lakers organization still acutely feel his absence. While enough time still hasn't passed to allow James to move on completely, remembering Bryant and honoring the competitive spirit that made him such a fierce competitor has helped his grieving process.

Several times during last season's victorious playoff and NBA Finals run, the Lakers wore their 'Black Mamba' jerseys to commemorate Bryant and his daughter Gianna, who died in a helicopter crash alongside seven others on January 26 last year.

The jerseys were designed by Bryant -- who gave himself the 'Black Mamba' nickname during his career -- and worn for the first time in the 2018 season. The Lakers would go on to win their first Larry O'Brien Trophy since Bryant's last title in 2010.

After the conclusion to last season was played in the Disney World bubble, the Lakers are back playing their home games at Staples Center where the two jersey numbers -- eight and 24 -- that Bryant wore during his 20-year Laker career are hanging in the rafters.

""As devastating and as tragic as it was -- and still is -- to all of us involved with it, only time. And it takes time. Everyone has their own grieving process,"" James said.

""Us being able to remember him, wearing [Mamba] jerseys during the postseason and have the postseason we had ... we have a lot of guys wearing his shoes, I'm able to wear the two-four on my finger every night and then when we play at Staples Center you see the eight, two-four in the rafters to live his legacy on.

""It's a lot of things that die in this world, but legends never die, and he's exactly that. So it's all about representing that.""

Bryant was James' boyhood idol and the pair went on to become close friends. James naturally struggled following Bryant's death and admitted it was a mental challenge being the leader of the Lakers organization during that time.

""I try not to put myself back in that head space because it's just too dark, for not only myself but for our organization and for everyone that's involved in it,"" he recalled.

""As a leader of the ballclub, it was my job and my responsibility to take it all on and represent our team with the most strength that I could. I wanted to let everyone inside this organization know that I was okay doing that.""

'I still have trouble'

Anthony Davis, the Lakers co-captain alongside James, admitted that he still struggles to come to terms with Bryant's death.

The 6-foot-10 big man has helped James shoulder much of the responsibility that comes with being an organization's leading figure -- both on and off the court -- including leading the team to win last season's title in Bryant's memory.

""As we approach his one-year anniversary, it saddens our hearts to actually come to the realization that he's gone,"" Davis said. ""I know I still have trouble with it, you still just can't believe it, especially when you were really close to him.""

Davis' dominant performances in that victorious postseason elevated him to another plane and established his place among the league's best players.

Part of what drove him to find another gear was the determination to win the title as a dedication to Bryant. Davis said the entire team was immediately aware that a championship would take on a greater significance in the wake of Bryant's death.

""It was January 26 of last year when it happened. From that point on, we were like: 'We have a purpose,'"" he recalled. ""To this day, 'Mamba on three!' anytime we bring it in because we still want to recognize that he's a part of our organization. And ever since the tragedy happened, we had a mindset that this is bigger than, you know, ourselves.""

""When the tragedy happened, it was more so, you know, 'Let's do it for him' and that's what we ended up doing all last year. Even when we play now, it's in the back of our mind that we are still playing for Kobe, his family and to help the city of LA, and I think we brought a ton of joy to our city when we won.

""We know we fought to the end for a purpose, and it wasn't just for ourselves. It was for the Bryant family and we were able to get that accomplished.""

On the court, Bryant and Pau Gasol formed a devastating partnership and would win two NBA championships. Off it, they became brothers. Gasol and his family have spent a lot of time with Bryant's wife Vanessa and their three girls since his death.

Pau's younger brother, Marc, joined the Lakers during the offseason and hopes to emulate his sibling's achievements with the franchise. He still struggles to open up on the incident that took Bryant's life, but says his presence is keenly felt within the organization and is still used as inspiration to achieve the team's goals this season.

""I'm not comfortable talking about it. I'm sorry. Still to this day, I have never really talked about it,"" Marc said.

""He will be a part of not only the team, the franchise, the city ... it's very emotional ... he's obviously someone that we looked up to."""
Italy Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will resign amid pandemic and political turmoil,"Rome (CNN) Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will resign on Tuesday morning, his office said in a statement on Monday, heightening political turmoil in the country as it battles Covid-19.

""The Council of Ministers is convened for tomorrow morning at 9 am, during which the Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, will communicate to the ministers his will to go to the (Presidential Palace) and hand in his resignation,"" the statement read. He will then see the President Sergio Mattarella, it added.

The resignation is a calculated move that could ultimately afford him another chance at forming a government.

Conte survived two confidence votes in Parliament last week. But he lost his governing majority in the Senate after his predecessor, Matteo Renzi, decided to withdraw the small Italia Viva party from Conte's ruling coalition over frustrations with the government's management of the Covid-19 pandemic and attendant economic recession.

President Mattarella can choose whether to accept Conte's resignation, and is likely to invite him to try to build a new governing majority. If Conte receives the mandate to form a new majority, he would need to add five more senators to his existing coalition.

How to figure out where all your money is going,"When it comes to managing your finances, you need to know where your money is going.

That means making a budget. No one loves hearing the dreaded 'B' word, but keeping a running tab of your daily expenses in your head probably isn't cutting it.

""People think they are spending less than they actually are,"" said Madison Sharick, manager of financial planning at PNC Investments.

Taking an ad hoc approach to budgeting can leave you in the hole at the end of the month, shortchanging your savings and pushing you into debt.

But don't think of a budget as a burden, recommended Tiffany Aliche, founder of personal finance website The Budgetnista and author of upcoming book ""Get Good with Money."" Instead, think of it as a way to achieve your financial goals. ""Your budget creates an environment to have the things you want in a way that is sustainable,"" she said.

And creating a system to track your expenses doesn't have to feel like a chore. Just find a method that works best for you.

If you want to do the heavy lifting

Whether it's with pen and paper or an Excel spreadsheet, tracking all your spending and incoming cash for at least a month provides a detailed log of your financial habits and makes you more aware of them.

The key is to be honest and thorough with your tracking -- yes, that cup of coffee needs to be noted. As does that birthday card for your mom. At the end of the month, you will have a line-by-line accounting of your finances giving you a clear picture of how much you are spending and saving.

To help categorize spending, Aliche places a ""B"" next to any bills that are fixed like rent or mortgage payments, and a ""UB"" for ""usage bills"" is placed on expenses that can fluctuate, like utility bills. She places a ""C"" next to expenditures that are a choice (and are the easiest to cut back on, like eating out or entertainment).

The downside: This method can be time-consuming and can feel tedious.

If you swipe all the time

If pen and paper aren't your thing, or you're just not diligent enough to keep up with all your purchases by hand, technology can help track and categorize your spending for you.

Various apps and websites like Mint or PocketGuard will sync with your accounts to create spending reports. These tools work best if almost all of your spending is done through credit cards and electronic purchases.

Some credit card providers also offer breakdowns of your spending to give you a sense of where your money is going, but they're usually limited to transactions you made with that account.

The downside: Tracking software tends to be backward-looking, tracking what you've already spent, which won't help prevent overspending.

You like to have rules to follow

Am I saving enough? Where can I cut back?

Now that you know where you've been putting your money, maybe you need some help figuring out where it should be going.

The 50/30/20 budget provides a guideline on how to divide your paycheck: 50% should go to required costs (for example: housing, groceries, utility bills) 30% to discretionary spending (travel, entertainment, subscriptions, etc.) and 20% to savings and debt.

Online calculators, like this one from Mint , can help you break it all down and customize it.

The downside: This method can be hard to follow for people in high cost-of-living areas -- where housing costs eat up a much larger portion of a budget -- or for those nearing retirement who may need to double down on savings.

If you're an extreme money manager... or aspire to be

Once you've paid all your bills, spent on your wants and put cash toward savings, you might still have some left over. Money left floating around in your checking account without a designated purpose often ends up being spent on luxuries and impulse buys.

That's not great.

A zero-sum budget helps avoid that problem by accounting for every dollar before you earn it. So you start with your income and then subtract all your expenses for the month with the goal of hitting zero. Expenses include everything you spend money on, including housing, food, savings and investments.

A popular zero-sum system is YNAB (You Need a Budget). The software will allocate your income to cover all your expenses, set goals and track your progress. EveryDollar from personal finance expert Dave Ramsey is another tool that uses the zero-sum method to allocate funds.

The downside: This approach can be time-consuming and hard to follow if your income frequently fluctuates.

If you need strict discipline

Having a visual reminder of where your money is going can help rein in overspending.

First, figure out your take-home pay for a month (or pay period) and then subtract any expenses that can't be paid in cash: things like, housing, savings and utilities (automate these payments if possible).

The leftover funds are what you have left to spend on everything else in your budget. Determine how much you can spend in each category (groceries, gas, entertainment) and then put cash for each designated amount into an envelope labeled with what it can be spent on.

Once the envelope is empty, no more spending in that category for the month.

If you don't want to deal with physical envelopes full of cash, apps like Goodbudget and Mvelopes allow you to create virtual envelopes to help track spending.

The downside: This old-school method requires a lot of cash and trips to the ATM and can be hard for families to execute together."
In the nearly 232-year history of the US Senate there have only been 11 Black senators,"(CNN) Congress set a new diversity record this year with its highest-ever number of women and racial minorities, including 60 Black lawmakers.

But that's mostly in the House

People of color have historically had a tougher time getting elected to the Senate. Newly elected Raphael Warnock is only the 11th Black US senator since the Senate convened for the first time in 1789. Only two of those have been women. And with the departure of Kamala Harris, the number of Black female US senators is now at zero

Voters in urban congressional districts tend to be more diverse and politically progressive, driving the higher number of minorities in the House. But that has had little effect on the number of Black senators.

""Black US Senate candidates, and especially Black politically progressive Democratic candidates, have found it difficult to get traction and win statewide elections due to the default political conservatism in White majority regions of the US,"" says Karlos Hill, chair of African-American studies at the University of Oklahoma.

From slavery and Jim Crow laws to suppression of minority voters, Black political candidates have long faced stumbling blocks. Hiram Revels, the first Black US senator, took office in the late 1800s as part of a wave of African American lawmakers during the Reconstruction era, but he was elected by the Mississippi legislature, not the state's voters.

Decades of voter suppression has limited Black voting power in the South, says Tobin Miller Shearer, director of African-American studies at the university of Montana.

Shearer also cites the ""incomplete legacy of the 15th Amendment,"" which granted everyone the right to vote but was undermined by states in the deep South which disfranchised Black voters through literacy tests, property ownership requirements and other racist measures.

It wasn't until 1965 that these discriminatory voting practices were outlawed by the federal Voting Rights Act.

Half a century later Black voters in the South are wielding new power, thanks in part to a push by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and other organizers to register new voters and combat voter suppression.

""Black candidates can compete and win competitive statewide races if they are able to effectively mobilize the Black electorate,"" Hill says. ""If the momentum created by Abrams and Warnock's recipe for mobilizing the Black electorate can be sustained, we could begin to see more Black representation in the US Senate. Only time will tell.""

Here are the 11 Black US senators:

Hiram Revels, Republican

Hiram Revels was a former barber and minister who served in the US Senate from 1870-1871.

Mississippi lawmakers chose him to fill a vacant seat, although he faced fierce opposition from his future colleagues who questioned his citizenship. Their argument was based on a 1857 Supreme Court case that ruled African Americans could not become citizens of the United States.

Born a free man in 1827 -- the slavery era -- he was an army chaplain during the Civil War, working at churches in Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana . After the war ended, he settled in Natchez, Mississippi, where he was an elder at the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and built a reputation as a respected community leader.

Mississippi was seeking readmission to representation in the US Congress and needed to fill two Senate seats that had been unoccupied since 1861, when it seceded from the Union. Revels was offered the shorter of two terms -- one set to expire in March 1871.

Revels took the oath of office 22 days after the ratification of the 15th Amendment, which held that Americans could not be denied the right to vote based on their race. Revels was ""the 15th Amendment in flesh and blood,"" civil rights activist Wendell Phillips said.

Blanche K. Bruce, Republican

Sen. Blanche K. Bruce of Mississippi was the first African American to serve a full term in the US Senate.

Born into slavery , he could not attend school, so he sneaked in some lessons from a tutor hired for his master's son. He escaped at the beginning of the Civil War and taught Black students in Missouri before moving to Mississippi, where he held several jobs, including a county sheriff and tax collector.

Like Revels, he was elected to the US senate by the Mississippi state legislature, not voters. Bruce served from 1875 to 1881.

Edward Brooke, Republican

Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts was the first African American elected to the US Senate by popular vote. He's also credited with integrating the Senate barbershop with his first haircut on Capitol Hill after his win.

The former World War II Army veteran graduated from Howard University and then attended law school at Boston University. He served two full terms in the Senate, from 1967 to 1979.

Brooke did not consider himself a trailblazing politician and maintained that he represented all his constituents. ""I do not intend to be a national leader of the Negro people. I intend to do my job as a senator from Massachusetts,"" he once declared. He died in 2015 at the age of 95.

Carol Moseley Braun, Democrat

Carol Moseley Braun shattered barriers as the first Black female US senator

Moseley Braun was also the first woman to serve on the powerful Finance Committee after Democrat Tom Daschle gave up his seat to create a spot for her.

The Democrat from Illinois served only one term, from 1993 to 1999. Before joining the Senate, she was a prosecutor in the office of the United States Attorney in Chicago and assistant majority leader in the Illinois House of Representatives.

She defeated both the Democratic incumbent and the Republican challenger for a seat in the US Senate, becoming the first female senator from Illinois as well. But she lost her bid for reelection to the Senate and unsuccessfully ran for president in 2004.

""I cannot escape the fact that I come to the Senate as a symbol of hope and change,"" she said shortly after being sworn in. ""Nor would I want to, because my presence in and of itself will change the US Senate.""

In the nearly three decades since, there has only been one other female Black senator: Kamala Harris.

Barack Obama, Democrat

Barack Obama was the fifth Black US senator and only the third one elected by voters.

He took the oath of office in January 2005 after serving in the Illinois state senate for almost eight years. Obama served one term in the Senate before running for President in 2008.

A former community organizer in Chicago and the first Black president of the Harvard Law Review, Obama made history again as the first Black President of the United States. He became the 44th President and served two terms.

Roland Burris, Democrat

Before taking on that role, Burris was the first African American to win a statewide election when he was elected comptroller of Illinois in 1978. After serving as comptroller for over a decade, he became attorney general of Illinois.

He served in the Senate until November 2010, when voters chose his successor in a special election. Citing fundraising difficulties, Burris chose to retire instead of running for a full term.

Tim Scott, Republican

In 2013 Tim Scott of South Carolina became the first African American US senator from the deep South since Reconstruction. The former entrepreneur worked in insurance and real estate, and served in the US House of Representatives before joining the Senate.

He was appointed US senator in January 2013 after the resignation of his predecessor, then was elected to a full term in 2016.

The lifelong resident of South Carolina has marveled at his family's remarkable journey, considering his grandfather once dropped out of school to pick cotton.

""Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,"" he said last year.

William Cowan, Democrat

William Cowan was appointed to fill John Kerry's seat after Kerry resigned in 2013 to become secretary of state.

Before his appointment, Cowan was a partner in a law firm and served as chief of staff to Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick.

His appointment in February 2013, a month after Scott, marked the first time two African Americans served in the US Senate simultaneously.

Cowan spent less than six months in the Senate and chose not to run in a special election to decide who would serve the remainder of Kerry's term.

Democrat Edward J. Markey won that race and has since been re-elected twice.

Cory Booker, Democrat

Cory Booker was the first African American to represent New Jersey in the US Senate.

He was the popular mayor of Newark, the state's largest city, before he joined the Senate after a special election in October 2013 following the death of Frank Lautenberg. The next year he was elected to a full term.

The former Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School graduate unsuccessfully ran for President in 2020 but was later reelected to the Senate.

Kamala Harris, Democrat

Kamala Harris was the first Black woman to represent California in the US senate when she took office in January 2017. But she was making history long before then.

She was the first Black person and first woman elected district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California, a position she held until 2016.

And she's still shattering glass ceilings. This month, she was sworn in as Vice President of the United States -- the first woman, first Black woman and first Asian American to hold that post.

Many advocates had called for a Black woman to replace her, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom instead appointed Alex Padilla, California's first Latino senator. While historic, it leaves no Black women in the upper chamber of the US Congress.

""When you think about the history of this country, of the challenges that exist for African Americans ... this is a real blow to the African-American community, to African-American women, to women in general,"" San Francisco Mayor London Breed said.

Raphael Warnock, Democrat

Rev. Raphael Warnock's win in a Georgia runoff election earlier this month played a big role in highlighting the growing power of Black voters in the South.

Like Revels, his path to the US Senate followed a key role in a pulpit of the Black church. Warnock is a senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King served as co-pastor. Black voters in Atlanta and its suburbs turned out in big numbers to help him win.

In his victory speech, Warnock reflected on his mother's teenage days picking cotton to in rural Georgia. He acknowledged how far the nation has come.

""Because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said.

Along with Booker and Scott, he is one of three African Americans in the current Senate."
China flies warplanes close to Taiwan in early test of Biden,"(CNN) China dispatched two large formations of warplanes close to the self-governing island of Taiwan over the weekend, presenting a significant foreign policy challenge to new United States President Joe Biden just days into his administration.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry said 13 Chinese planes entered the southwestern portion of the island's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Saturday followed by 15 on Sunday, prompting Taipei to take defensive measures, including scrambling fighter jets to monitor the Chinese flights.

According to Taiwan's Defense Ministry, Chinese military planes made more than 380 flights into the island's air defense identification zone last year. The US Federal Aviation Administration defines an ADIZ as ""a designated area of airspace over land or water within which a country requires the immediate and positive identification, location, and air traffic control of aircraft in the interest of the country's national security.""

While the frequency of such drills has increased in recent years, the timing and the composition of the latest formations -- mostly fighter jets and bombers -- appeared intended to send a message to the new administration in Washington.

Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed that Beijing will never allow the island to become independent and has refused to rule out the use of force if necessary.

JUST WATCHED Decoding the China-Taiwan relationship Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Decoding the China-Taiwan relationship 02:24

In a statement Saturday , the Biden administration urged Beijing to stop trying to intimidate Taiwan and promised support for the democratic government in Taipei.

""We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected representatives,"" US State Department spokesman Ned Price said, adding that US-Taiwan ties are deepening and Washington remains committed to the island's self-rule.

The US showed a strong commitment to Taiwan's defense during the Trump administration, approving the sale of advanced military hardware to Taipei, including F-16 fighter jets, while sending high-level envoys to the island, both moves that angered Beijing.

In an early show of support from the Biden administration toward the island, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, attended Biden's inauguration last week. It was the first such official invitation to a representative of the Taipei government since 1979, when Washington established formal diplomatic ties with Beijing. On the same day, Beijing announced sanctions against outgoing US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 27 other high-ranking officials under Trump, accusing them of ""prejudice and hatred against China.""

US carrier in South China Sea

Besides backing Taiwan, State Department spokesman Price said on Saturday that Washington would also stand with other Indo-Pacific friends and allies, as China ramps up its military activities in the region.

In a display of that solidarity, a US Navy aircraft carrier strike group entered the South China Sea at the weekend, the first deployment during the Biden administration of one of the 100,000-ton warships with its contingent of more than 60 aircraft.

The US guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain, rear, and the Royal Australian Navy HMAS Ballarat sail together during integrated operations in the South China Sea in October.

A US Navy statement said the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its guided-missile cruiser and destroyer escorts were on a scheduled deployment to uphold freedom of the seas in the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea, almost all of which China claims as its sovereign territory.

""With two-thirds of the world's trade traveling through this very important region, it is vital that we maintain our presence and continue to promote the rules-based order,"" Rear Adm. Doug Verissimo, commander of Carrier Strike Group Nine, said in a statement.

But at the close of 2020, China said military movements like that of the Roosevelt strike group inflamed tensions.

""Some countries outside the region come from afar to flex their military muscles, ignite confrontations, and create tensions in the South China Sea, which is the root reason for the 'militarization' of this region,"" Defense Ministry spokesperson Senior Col. Tan Kefei said at a regular press briefing.

Last year, the US Navy sent two of its aircraft carriers, the world's largest warships, into the South China Sea on two occasions for dual exercises, something it had not done in the previous six years.

Washington also regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, most recently in December. They involve US warships steaming within the 12-nautical mile limit of coastlines that nations can claim as their territorial waters.

China's new coast guard law

On Friday, Beijing gave another indication of how it can tighten its control over waters it claims in the region, passing a new law that authorizes its coast guard to fire on foreign vessels.

The law, which takes effect February 1, also allows the coast guard to demolish foreign structures built on Chinese-claimed reefs and islands and for it to set up exclusion zones to keep foreign vessels out.

The law could not only increase chances of confrontation between China and other South China Sea claimants -- which include Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan -- but also in the East China Sea, where China and Japan contest sovereignty over an island group known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China

The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands are shown in a file photo.

On its English-language news website on Monday, China's military specifically referred to the Japanese-controlled islands when announcing enactment of the law, with a headline saying it safeguards Beijing's sovereignty over the uninhabited rocky chain, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo.

""The new coastguard law shows China's clear attitude and determination to safeguard its sovereignty,"" the report said, citing Lu Yaodong, a research fellow with the Institute of Japanese Studies under the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

""Regular patrols near the Diaoyu Islands will be guaranteed by the legislation,"" Lu was quoted as saying.

Chinese vessels spent record amounts of time in the waters around the islands last year, drawing condemnation from Tokyo. Washington has repeatedly said the islands are covered by the US-Japan mutual defense treaty, which would obligate the US to respond to any Chinese action against Japanese ships there."
Biden replaces controversial White House physician,"Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden has replaced the controversial White House physician who offered misleading information about President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis last fall.

A White House official said Biden had selected Dr. Kevin O'Connor to replace Dr. Sean Conley as his doctor. It's not uncommon for a president to name his own physician when taking office, though his two most recent predecessors each retained the incumbent doctor who had attended the men who served before them.

Conley generated controversy in the fall when he admitted to offering rosy descriptions of Trump's condition because the White House wanted to project optimism. In reality, Trump suffered serious conditions like shortness of breath that required supplemental oxygen.

Biden has a long history with O'Connor, who served as his physician while vice president. He is a retired US Army colonel who served in the 82nd Airborne Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army Special Operations Command.

He administered Biden's physical in 2019 and prepared a report that deemed the then-candidate ""healthy"" and ""vigorous."" At 78, Biden is the oldest newly inaugurated president in history.

Senate Republicans just took two big hits to their 2022 chances,"(CNN) Just days into their newfound status as the minority party, Senate Republicans suffered two body blows that could badly complicate their chances of retaking control in 2022.

The first came Monday morning, with Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's announcement that he would retire in 2022 rather than seek a third term.

""This is a tough time to be in public service,"" Portman said in announcing his decision. ""For many of the issues I am most passionate about, I will continue to make a difference outside of the Senate, beyond 2022.""

The Portman news comes hard on the heels of a major Republican recruiting setback over the weekend, when Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey told The New York Times he will not challenge Sen. Mark Kelly (D) next November.

""I'm not running for the United States Senate,"" Ducey told the Times. ""It's a no. I'm 100 percent focused on being the governor of the state of Arizona. I've accepted the role as the chairman of the [Republican Governors Association]. So I've got a full-time job and then I've got a full-time job beyond that. And that's what my focus is.""

Combine the two announcements, and the GOP's quest to retake the majority they lost when Democrats swept both Georgia runoffs earlier this month is off to a decidedly rocky start.

Let's take Portman first.

His retirement decision came as an absolute shock to political Washington -- although maybe it shouldn't have given the current state of the Republican Party.

Portman has been a stalwart member of the GOP establishment for decades. He served in the House from 1993 to 2005 and as the director of the Office of Management and Budget and US Trade Representative during George W. Bush's administration. He ran for Senate in 2010 and won handily; in 2016 he crushed former Gov. Ted Strickland by 19 points in what Democrats had hoped would be a serious race.

But during the Trump years, Portman's brand of pragmatic conservatism had fallen very much out of favor. And the Ohio Republican's discontent about the state of political affairs is written everywhere in his retirement announcement.

""I don't think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision,"" said Portman.

His decision takes a seat that would have likely been of little concern for Republicans -- given Portman's demonstrated electoral successes and the state's clear GOP lean -- and puts it squarely in the potentially competitive category.

All eyes -- especially those in Washington -- will immediately turn to Rep. Jim Jordan, perhaps the most prominent supporter of ex-President Donald Trump's in the House and someone who would likely have considerable appeal in a Republican primary in the state. There will be plenty of other names mentioned -- Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, to name two -- but much hinges on what Jordan decides.

If Jordan runs and wins the nomination, the seat becomes more imperiled for Republicans. While Ohio is clearly no longer the swing state that it was in the early 2000s -- Trump beat Joe Biden by 8 points there in 2020 -- there is still a path to Democrats winning statewide, as Sen. Sherrod Brown has proven.

And that path involves Republicans nominating a candidate that is too far to the ideological right -- allowing the Democratic nominee to co-opt the not-insignificant political center. Which, in theory, is exactly what might happen if Republicans nominate Jordan.

While there is still lots (and lots) we don't know about how the Ohio seat will shake out, what we do know is that the seat is considerably more vulnerable today than it was yesterday.

Now to Arizona.

Kelly's decisive win over appointed Sen. Martha McSally was in a special election last November, meaning that he has to run again for a full six-year term in November 2022. Which is no easy task, especially when you consider how competitive the state is at the federal level. (Biden beat Trump by less than 11,000 votes of out of more than 3.2 million cast.)

But Kelly is a formidable candidate -- particularly on the fundraising side, where he raked in more than $100 million in 2020. Beating him will be no easy task.

Especially when you consider that:

1) The Republican bench in Arizona is surprisingly thin beyond Ducey.

The Republican nightmare scenario is if Ward becomes a candidate. Ward ran in a primary against Sen. John McCain in 2016 and challenged then-Sen. Jeff Flake (R) in 2018. (Flake eventually retired and Republicans chose McSally over Ward.)

Ward, like Jordan in Ohio, would likely start out as the favorite in a Republican primary due to her hard-line support of Trump. ""The Arizona Legislature should DE-CERTIFY the false results of the 2020 election until at which time a full and thorough audit of the vote can be performed,"" the Arizona GOP's official Twitter account tweeted earlier this month. ""Do it quick. Make Democrats lose their collective minds as they rage against transparency and integrity. Big win for AZ!""

But Ward as the Republican nominee against Kelly would be a massive problem for Republicans, likely costing them one of their few offensive opportunities on the 2022 map.

Yes, it's early to talk about how voters will feel come November 2022. But make no mistake: Portman's retirement and Ducey's no-go decision are twin body blows for Republicans in the Senate already reeling from what happened in Georgia."
Merck halts development of its Covid-19 vaccine candidates,"British lawmakers are calling on the country's government to set out a “route map” for the reopening of schools, amid media reports that students might not return to in-person teaching until after the Easter holidays.

Chairman of the education select committee, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, tweeted Sunday that he had asked to table an urgent question on the matter in Parliament.

“Given media speculation on schools no longer opening post Feb half-term, I've written to Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to ask for House of Commons Urgent Question to get clarity,” Halfon added.

“We know the significant damage this is doing to children in terms of mental health, educational attainment, safeguarding hazards and their general wellbeing,” Halfon said in an interview with Sky News on Monday.

He said he’d like a plan for support staff and teachers to be given the vaccination as a priority after the clinically vulnerable. He added he was not a lockdown skeptic but worried hugely about the effects of school closures on children.

Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told BBC Breakfast she was “not aware of any decisions being made yet” over when schools would reopen.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, also called for a government plan on schools, including which children could be brought back first and when, in an interview with BBC News on Monday. He asked whether there could be a rota system in place and said the “sense of a plan would give a reassurance for parents.”

Writing in the Daily Mail newspaper on Monday, UK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “The last thing any parent wanted was to see schools closing to most pupils -- as they had to at the start of this month.” On returning to classrooms, he said “as soon as Covid infection rates are back under control then we will get them back there as quickly as we can”.

It comes as other Conservative MPs, such as Esther McVey, are backing a campaign to reopen schools. McVey tweeted Sunday: ""Schools need to reopen for the child’s best interest and for families too. If vaccinating teachers, after the most vulnerable in society, removes the barriers to reopening schools then we should do it. You can’t close schools and not have a workable alternative.""

Schools in England have been closed to all students expect for children of key workers and vulnerable pupils since the start of a national lockdown on January 5.

"Baby tyrannosaurs were about the size of a dog, new study shows","(CNN) Tyrannosaurs were fearsome predators in the dinosaur kingdom, but new research shows their hatchlings were about as big as a medium-sized dog.

Researchers studying the first-known fossils of tyrannosaur embryos suggest the dinosaurs were approximately three feet long when they hatched, according to a study from the University of Edinburgh, published Monday.

A team of paleontologists studied the fossilized remains of a tyrannosaurus embryo, namely a jaw bone and claw that were found in Canada and the US, respectively.

After producing 3D scans of the remains, researchers were able to predict that the dinosaurs would have hatched from eggs about 17 inches long.

The tyrannosaurs would have reached around 35 feet in length when fully grown. Left to right, a fully grown Albertsosaurus, an Albertosaurus embryo, a Daspletosaurus embryo.

Remains of tyrannosaurus eggs have never been found, but this finding could help paleontologists spot them in the future.

Justice Department watchdog investigating possible attempt to overturn election results,"(CNN) The Justice Department's internal watchdog will investigate whether any department official sought to have the department overturn President Joe Biden's election win.

The office of Inspector General Michael Horowitz is launching ""an investigation into whether any former or current DOJ official engaged in an improper attempt to have DOJ seek to alter the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election,"" it announced Monday.

The probe comes on the heels of reports from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal that former President Donald Trump attempted to use his Justice Department to challenge the election results, an effort that included the possibility of Trump ousting then-acting Attorney General Jeffery Rosen.

The Times said in a report published Friday that Jeffrey Clark, a lawyer for the DOJ, nearly convinced Trump earlier this month to remove Rosen and use the department to undo Georgia's election results.

Clark -- who appealed to the former President's false claims of election fraud -- met with Trump earlier in January and told Rosen following the meeting that the then-President was going to replace him with Clark. Clark would then move to keep Congress from certifying the election results in Biden's favor, according to the paper.

Biden lifts transgender military ban,"(CNN) President Joe Biden signed an executive order to repeal a Trump-era ban on most transgender Americans joining the military on Monday alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

""This is reinstating a position that the previous commanders and, as well as the secretaries, have supported. And what I'm doing is enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform,"" Biden said, speaking from the Oval Office just before signing the executive order.

President Donald Trump's ban has been rebuked by the Democrat-led House of Representatives and condemned by LGBTQ activists as discriminatory. Austin voiced his support for overturning the ban in his Senate confirmation hearing last week.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that cases in which transgender service members were discharged from the military because of their gender identity would be reexamined.

""No one will be separated or discharged from the military or denied reenlistment on the basis of gender identity, and for those transgender service members who were discharged or separated because of gender identity, their cases will be reexamined,"" Psaki said during a White House briefing.

California lifts regional stay-at-home orders as ICU crowding eases,"(CNN) California health officials ended the state's regional stay-at-home order on Monday, saying the latest projections for intensive care unit capacity allowed the restrictions to be lifted.

The order applied to the Southern California, San Joaquin Valley and Bay Area regions, which are home to more than 90% of the state's population of 39 million people. The four-week ICU projections for these areas show enough capacity to exit the order, according to the California Department of Public Health.

All 58 counties now return to the state's tier-based system, which places each into one of four color-coded tiers indicating which activities and businesses are allowed based on local coronavirus case rates and test positivity. The tiers are reassessed every Tuesday.

""Today, we can lay claim to starting to see some real light at the end of the tunnel as it relates to case numbers,"" said Gov. Gavin Newsom.

The majority of counties are in the strictest, or purple, tier . Most indoor businesses remain closed but many can open outdoors with modifications, including restaurants, movie theaters, places of worship, and family entertainment such as mini golf. Modifications would include limited capacity and the use of masks.

Personal care services, such as barbershops, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlors, and piercing shops, can open indoors with modifications. Retail businesses are limited to 25% capacity indoors.

Under the regional stay-at-home order, personal care services and movie theaters were closed and restaurants were limited to takeout and delivery only.

Schools in the purple tier must offer remote learning only -- but can reopen for in-person instruction after a county has been in the red tier for at least two weeks.

Individual counties, however, have the authority to set their own restrictions and can choose to keep the tougher restrictions in place. California residents can check the status of businesses and activities in their county on the state's coronavirus website

'Not out of the woods'

San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a tweet that the city will be in the purple tier. ""We will be moving forward with some limited re-openings, including outdoor dining and personal services,"" she said.

California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said the surge of cases after the December holidays did not overwhelm the health care system to the degree officials had feared.

""California is slowly starting to emerge from the most dangerous surge of this pandemic yet, which is the light at the end of the tunnel we've been hoping for,"" he said.

The ICU capacity projections are based on four factors: current estimated regional ICU capacity available, a measure of current community transmission, current regional case rates and the proportion of ICU cases being admitted, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services

The model the state uses to calculate its four-week projections has not been made public, a situation that has led to criticism. Ghaly said the state was making the model available on Monday on the health department's website.

The Bay Area region is currently reporting 8.2% ICU capacity while the worst-hit regions of San Joaquin Valley and Southern California are reporting 0.0% ICU availability.

Officials said that state projections show that in four weeks, ICU capacity in the Bay Area will be up to 25%, with the Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley regions rising to 33.3% and 22.3%, respectively.

""We're not out of the woods (but) we're seeing a flattening of the curve,"" he said during an online news briefing

He cited a number of statistics that are moving in a positive direction, including that hospitalizations are down 19.8% and Covid-19 ICU admissions are down 9.5% over the past 14 days. The 14-day average positivity rate also continues to decline, down more than 4% to 9.4% over the latest 14-day period.

Newsom, a Democrat, is facing a movement to recall him in part because of the stay-at-home orders he imposed.

California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson criticized the decision to lift the restrictions in a Twitter post , saying it was ""sad and pathetic.""

""This Governor's decisions have never been based on science,"" she wrote. ""Him re-opening our state is not an attempt to help working Californians, but rather an attempt to counter the Recall Movement.""

Newsom said criticism that the decision to lift the stay-at-home order was due to the recall movement was ""utter nonsense.""

Order was instituted as cases surged

The regional stay-at-home orders were instituted in early December as Covid-19 cases surged. The order went into effect if ICU capacity dropped below 15% in one of five regions into which the state is divided: Northern California, Bay Area, Greater Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley and Southern California.

The Southern California and San Joaquin Valley regions have been under the state order since December 6 and the Bay Area since December 17. The mandate, aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19, instructed residents to stay home as much as possible and not mix with other households. It closed hair salons, museums, movie theaters, and restricted restaurants to takeout or delivery service.

The Greater Sacramento region exited the order on January 12 and the Northern California region never entered the order.

On December 1, the state reported 9,365 patients hospitalized with Covid-19. By January 1, hospitalizations were past 21,000, peaking on January 6 with 22,853. Since then, hospitalizations have dropped with 18,347 reported on Sunday, below the 14-day average of 20,807. Correspondingly, the number of available intensive care unit beds had dropped from 1,810 on December 2 to 1,168 beds on Sunday.

A letter from the California Restaurant Association to its members had indicated that the order would be lifted Monday. The association, which shared the letter with CNN, said it had been notified of the plan Sunday evening by the governor's office

New cases are declining

New cases in the state are on the decline. The most recent data shows 27,007 new infections were reported Sunday but that is below the 14-day average of 30,382 and it marks the first full week of fewer than 30,000 cases each day since early December. On January 1, there were 53,341 cases reported and the 14-day average then was above 40,000.

The stay-at-home orders placed restrictions on businesses, including a ban on outdoor dining . The restaurant industry has bitterly opposed the orders and has sued to stop them. A coalition of Bay Area wineries sued over the outdoor dining restrictions earlier this month and the restaurant association sued Los Angeles County in November over its outdoor dining restrictions.

A spokesman for the restaurant association told CNN early Monday that it did not have any additional comment about the lifting of the stay-at-home orders.

While new cases may be declining, the death toll in California remains high. The state reported its highest single day of deaths on Thursday with 764, above the 14-day rolling average of 499. Deaths on Sunday were 328, below the 14-day average of 504.

The Los Angeles Times reported that it was unclear whether restrictions in Los Angeles County would be eased by the lifting of the order.

Los Angeles County has been the epicenter of the virus' surge in the state. More than 6,800 people have died in the county since December 1 and more than 1 million of the state's 3 million cases are in the county."
Storm could bring historic snowfall to parts of Midwest,"(CNN) More than 100 million people are under winter weather alerts prompted by two major storm systems taking shape this week.

A winter weather advisory is in place for New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC, as light precipitation will spread through the region Monday night and Tuesday. Accumulations will be light, but the National Weather Service is warning of travel impacts thanks to around an inch of snow and light glazing of ice.

But the main event in this storm system will be in the Midwest.

The storm will dump significant snow from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic Coast through Tuesday night. The deepest snow will pile up across Iowa. Some of the snow will be very heavy, with rates of up to 2 inches an hour, says the Weather Prediction Center.

""If these snow totals materialize, they would be very rare for Iowa,"" the National Weather Service in Des Moines wrote.

Supreme Court denies NY Democrat Sheldon Silver's appeal of bribery conviction,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Monday denied an appeal by former New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for his bribery conviction.

It is the latest case in which the nine justices have considered exploring the reach of federal prosecutors when it comes to policing public officials. Silver's petition had been pending before the justices for several weeks and they discussed it most recently at their private conference last Friday.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented from the order.

In advising the justices to deny the appeal from Silver, a Democrat, former Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall argued that he engaged in ""multiple schemes to use his political positions to enrich himself."" In one example, the government alleges Silver accepted thousands of dollars from two real estate developers in exchange for taking official action that benefited developers.

In court papers asking the justices to take up his case, Silver's lawyer argued his conviction ""places every state official at the mercy of federal prosecutors seeking to criminalize lawful political conduct that offends them, with only a jury's speculation about the official's inner thoughts standing between the official and a federal penitentiary.""

At least 20 people tested positive for Covid-19 after attending a high school wrestling tournament,"(CNN) More than 20 student athletes, staff and spectators who attended a wrestling tournament in Louisiana have tested positive for Covid-19 . Now, the state health department is advising everyone who attended to get tested for the virus.

The Louisiana Classic Wrestling Tournament took place earlier this month at the Lamar Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales, a town about 60 miles west of New Orleans. Students, parents and school staff from across the state convened over two days to watch high school wrestling matches.

""Anyone who attended the tournament either day -- January 15 or January 16 -- should consider themselves exposed to COVID-19,"" the Louisiana Department of Health's statement said

Photos from the event published by the Acadiana Advocate show inconsistent mask use among those in attendance, many of whom were seated within close proximity of each other.

In total, nearly 1,400 people attended the tournament, which was below the 25% threshold for venue occupancy, which follows the state's sporting event policy during the pandemic, Louisiana High School Athletic Association executive director Eddie Bonine told CNN in an email.

Bonine said there are no plans to cancel future wrestling events, and the athletic association won't implement additional Covid-19 prevention efforts beyond the mask mandates, limited capacity and screening processes.

""The protocols, recommendations and guidelines this association has in place, if adhered to, will keep any and all participants and spectators safe,"" Bonine said. The director said he did not attend the tournament and could not speak to circumstances.

Ascension Parish, where the wrestling tournament took place, is at ""highest risk"" of Covid-19, according to the state health department's coronavirus case tracker . The parish has seen nearly 10,000 Covid-19 cases among its 126,600-plus residents.

CNN has reached out to the Lamar Dixon Expo Center for comment and is waiting to hear back.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention generally advises against attending indoor events during the pandemic. In its guidelines for youth sports , the CDC specifically names wrestling as a sport that requires players to come within six feet of each other. For wrestling matches during the pandemic, the CDC advises modifying play to avoid competition altogether.

If sporting events must be held indoors, the CDC says, they should take place only in well-ventilated buildings. Attendees inside should maintain ample distance from each other and wear masks, the CDC says."
Supreme Court dismisses emoluments cases against Trump,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a case concerning whether former President Donald Trump violated provisions of the Constitution that bar a president from profiting from a foreign government.

The court instructed the lower courts to wipe away previous lower court opinions that went against Trump because he is no longer in office. It leaves unresolved a novel question raised in the case because Trump, unlike other presidents, did not use a blind trust when he assumed the presidency, but instead continued to retain an interest in his businesses and let those businesses take money from foreign and domestic governments.

The order was issued without comment or dissent.

There were two cases covering the issue before the justices. One was initiated by lawyers for Maryland and Washington, DC, who argued Trump violated the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign and domestic governments through the Trump International Hotel in DC. They said they were disadvantaged in competing for business from foreign and state officials who may choose to do business with entities in which the President had a financial interest in order to curry favor.

A second case was brought by various members of the hospitality industry who own or work in hotels or restaurants in New York and Washington, who also argued they were put at a competitive disadvantage.

Deepak Gupta, one of the attorneys challenging Trump in the disputes, said on Twitter following the court's decision that he wasn't surprised the case was dismissed as moot after Trump left office, adding it's ""disappointing that Trump ran out the clock.""

""I'm proud of the work we did to ensure the Constitution's anti-corruption norms weren't forgotten,"" he wrote.

The group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which had a part in the cases against Trump, said on Monday that the lawsuits ""made the American people aware for four years of the pervasive corruption that came from a president maintaining a global business and taking benefits and payments from foreign and domestic governments.""

""Only Trump losing the presidency and leaving office ended these corrupt constitutional violations stopped these groundbreaking lawsuits,"" Noah Bookbinder, the group's executive director, said in a statement.

At the center of the case was the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which has faced few judicial interpretations since it was written almost 250 years ago.

The Emoluments Clause prohibits a president from receiving an ""emolument"" or profit from any ""King, Prince, or foreign state"" unless Congress consents. The so-called domestic emoluments clause entitles a president to receive a salary and benefits fixed in advance by Congress, but prohibits him from receiving ""any other emolument from the United States.""

""The Supreme Court's procedural order not only wipes away two lower court rulings, but it also orders dismissal of the entire dispute -- leaving for some other time resolution of the many questions Trump's conduct raised about the Emoluments Clause,"" said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

""Ordinarily, the Court pursues such a step only when the prevailing party moots a case while the appeal is pending -- as opposed to here, where the disputes became moot because Trump's term ended,"" he added. ""Today's orders suggest that the court is increasingly willing to invoke this doctrine to avoid highly charged political disputes, even if the mootness wasn't caused by the parties that won below.""

A lower court had allowed 38 subpoenas that were served on five federal agencies that demanded information about money spent by those agencies at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC.

In court papers, lawyers for Trump's Department of Justice had argued the lower court in the case brought by Maryland and DC ""fundamentally erred in permitting this unprecedented and extraordinary lawsuit to proceed"" and called the alleged injury ""attenuated and speculative.""

DC Attorney General Karl Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a joint statement on Monday that their case ""will serve as precedent that will help stop anyone else from using the presidency or other federal office for personal financial gain the way that President Trump has over the past four years.""

Former Office of Government Ethics chief Walter Shaub blasted the court's decision as ""insane"" in a tweet, arguing the emolument cases were not moot, as the court said.

""(Trump) still has the money. When any other federal employee violates the emoluments clause they have to forfeit the money,"" Shaub wrote.

"What to do, and not do, before and after your Covid vaccine shot","(CNN) It's an all-out sprint to get Americans vaccinated against the deadly novel coronavirus. As you prepare to get your shot, here are 10 actions experts suggest doing -- and avoiding.

DO: Get your vaccine when it's your turn.

Youshould be able to find out when it's your turn to be vaccinated and how to register in your neighborhood by reaching out to your state or local health department. CNN has created a list of state websites, emails and phone numbers for all 50 states and territories . Check there for information on available vaccine registrations in your local area.

DON'T: Let disinformation on vaccines cloud your judgment.

Social media is rife with disinformation about both Covid-19 and the vaccines that are available to prevent it.

If you have doubts about the vaccine, get educated -- the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is just one of many trusted organizations with vetted, science-based facts about the virus and available vaccines

Pharmacist Preston Young administers a Moderna Covid-19 vaccination during a drive-thru clinic on January 13 in Santa Rosa, California.

DO: Get vaccinated if you've already had Covid-19.

Reinfection with Covid-19 is definitively possible, the CDC says, so everyone needs to get a coronavirus vaccination, including those who have already had the illness.

Note: If you were given monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma while sick with Covid-19, you should wait 90 days after treatment before getting the vaccine, the CDC advises. Check with your doctor before scheduling the shot.

DON'T: Get a shot if you currently have Covid-19 or have been exposed.

If you have tested positive for Covid-19 or been exposed to someone who has the illness, you should not go to the vaccination site to get your shot until your symptoms and isolation period have passed, said Dr. Michael Ison, a professor in the division of infectious diseases and organ transplantation at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.

""Quite simply, you don't want to get people who are waiting in line sick. You don't want to get the health care staff sick,"" Ison said.

DO: Get the shot even if you still have Covid symptoms months later.

A growing number of people are becoming coronavirus ""long-haulers"" -- people who continue to suffer fatigue, brain fog, aches, pains, headaches and more for months after the virus has left their systems.

Don't let your ongoing reactions keep you from getting the shot, said vaccine scientist Dr. Peter Hotez, professor and dean at the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

""We think long-haul symptoms are not due to active virus infection, but to prolonged inflammatory responses to the virus,"" Hotez said.

DON'T: Get another type of vaccine within 14 days of the Covid-19 shot.

Wait at least 14 days before or after getting another vaccine, including a flu or shingles shot, to get a Covid-19 vaccination, the CDC says.

However, if you inadvertently did get another vaccine within that two-week time frame, you should complete the Covid-19 series on schedule. As more information on how vaccines interact becomes available, the CDC says it may update this guidance

DO: Tell vaccine staff about any allergies or past allergic reactions.

It's rare, but a few people have had moderate-to-severe allergic reactions after being given the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines, so be sure to tell the nurse at the vaccination site about any past allergic reactions.

If you do have a history of immediate or severe allergic reactions to vaccines or other injections, try to have an EpiPen on hand, said Dr. Saju Mathew, an Atlanta-based primary care physician and public health specialist.

DON'T: Drive away before your 15- to 30-minute wait is up.

The CDC requires that everyone receiving a coronavirus vaccination wait 15 minutes in their car before driving away. If you have a history of severe allergic reactions, you'll be required to wait 30 minutes in your car to be sure you're safe to drive. Both are a minor inconvenience, experts say, compared to the dangers of an adverse reaction of dizziness or worse while driving.

Common reactions to the vaccine are soreness and swelling at the injection site. Sometimes, more typically after the second shot, people may experience such Covid-like signs as fever, fatigue, headache and chills.

DO: Get your second shot of vaccine within the recommended time frame.

Getting a second shot of the vaccine is needed to be sure that you have protection, according to Baylor's Hotez.

""In looking at the Phase 1, Phase 2 data, what I saw with a single dose is some people had high levels of virus-neutralizing antibody, others were nonresponders,"" he said. ""So the major reason for the second dose is to get everybody to respond. If you just get a single dose, you don't really know where you stand.""

Pfizer-BioNTech doses should be given 21 days apart, the CDC says, while the second dose of Moderna is administered 28 days after the first. Do not get your second dose early, but if you have trouble scheduling, waiting a few days after the due date -- and perhaps longer -- for either vaccine should not be an issue, the CDC says.

DO: Continue wearing masks and practicing social distancing after your shots.

Continue to wear your masks and practice appropriate social distancing after both your first and second doses of vaccine, the CDC says. The first dose will not produce enough of an immune response to protect you or others. The second dose should provide approximately 95% protection within one to two weeks after administration, depending on the vaccine.

However, the CDC says, even after you are fully vaccinated you may still be a silent carrier of the coronavirus.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""We ... don't yet know whether getting a COVID-19 vaccine will prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to other people,"" the CDC says.

So to protect others, continue to wear a mask over your nose and mouth, stay at least 6 feet away from others, avoid crowds and crowded and poorly ventilated spaces, and wash your hands often for at least 20 full seconds."
An artist is spreading joy in her community with a miniature outdoor art gallery,"(CNN) — An artist yearning to help people connect during the coronavirus pandemic has created a miniature art gallery that invites visitors to keep the art.

In December, Stacy Milrany put up a white wooden box that held an unexpected treasure in front of her home, nestled in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood.

Inside the box was a mini art gallery, complete with small shelves and easels that hold artworks. She called it the Little Free Art Gallery , inspired by the nonprofit organization Little Free Library which makes book-sharing boxes.

""During this pandemic, everybody has been trying to find ways to bring more light to each other, to bring some hope, to create more fun, especially through creative ways to connect with each other when we've been physically cut off,"" Milrany told CNN.

""It's a nice little surprise for people, but it's also a joy for me to see creativity in font of my house.""

Unlike traditional museums, Milrany's gallery encourages spectators to keep their favorite artwork. The only elements they can't remove are the plastic miniature gallery figures placed in front of the art.

And she loves it when people leave behind art of their own to replace the pieces they took. That isn't a requirement.

On the first day of her opening -- which featured her painting titled "" Cat Hair "" -- Milrany shared the project on Instagram and the neighborhood app Nextdoor. Within days,10 pieces had already come and gone, she said.

When she has time, Milrany meets the people who share their art while other days she just watches as the gallery changes, usually about five times a day.

Some of the gallery's visitors, she says, are so invested they come by several times a day.

Due to the pandemic, many museums and art galleries are closed. In states where they're open, not everyone feels comfortable visiting.

Despite the distance people are experiencing from public spaces and each other, Milrany says her project has helped people connect.

""It makes me feel like I'm helping in some kind of way, especially at a time when loneliness multiplied in the past year because of the pandemic,"" Milrany said. ""It's getting people to go out to see what their neighbors are contributing, and people who put their own artwork that gets claimed know somebody has enjoyed their little masterpiece.""

Since her tiny gallery opened over a month ago, more than 100 works of art have been displayed and taken home by visitors.

""I'm overjoyed that people are finding some fun and hope in it,"" Milrany said. ""It gives me hope in people, in the US, in humanity for appreciating these little sentiments of human expression, the authenticity, the real stuff.""

People who share their own work showcase various art genres, ranging from traditional oil paintings and conceptual art to sculptures and collages.

Along with spreading joy, Milrany uses her tiny art gallery -- which she plans to rename Free Little Art Gallery to avoid confusion with the mini libraries -- to give local artists a chance to be noticed. When artists sign their work, Milrany posts it on Instagram and tags the creator."

""Our county has a 25-year history of just sort of everybody -- the hospital, the school districts, law enforcement, fire agencies, federal state partners -- we just cooperate.""

When the coronavirus pandemic started and there was a need for personal protective equipment and testing, groups working with the emergency management center banded together to respond.

Now the cross-functional team of essential workers and volunteers are working to distribute the vaccine and it's working, says Elliott, who is in charge of vaccine distribution for the county. In fact, he says a single dose hasn't been wasted.

The story is different across the country. The United States is struggling to get the precious vaccine into arms, with supply issues , logistics challenges, long lines and crashed appointment sites. As of Friday, 16.2 million Americans, about 4.5% of the US population, had received their first dose and about 2.8 million people are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Washington state has distributed more than 335,000 vaccines, which is 48% of the delivered doses given, according to the state's Department of Health Covid-19 dashboard , as of January 18.

While Kittitas County has given 53% of its current vaccines, the county has vaccine clinics running through this week to deliver a new batch of more than 2,000 vaccines, according to Kittitas Valley Healthcare. With all of the appointments taken, the county estimates having 97% of their doses administered by the end of this week.

""The infrastructure that we have with everybody communicating, everybody willing to be flexible and play whatever role's necessary and an understanding of (incident command system) and emergency operation centers gives us the framework to do it,"" Elliott told CNN.

Fighting fires brought lessons for vaccine rollout

When you're fighting large fires, you have to act fast and resources can change in a flash, so learning to change plans and stay flexible is part of the job, Elliott said.

""In fires, we make do, and you build plans around what you have available, and what the priorities are,"" Elliott said. ""Those change almost daily at wildland fires because the risks change, the weather changes, all of those things are changing, and you get more resources, or you get resources taken away from you.""

Deputy Fire Chief Rich Elliott of Kittitas Valley Fire and Rescue receives the Covid-19 vaccine in Kittitas County, Washington.

Shifting resources and changing priorities are similar themes when it comes to fighting the pandemic.

""The same thing is true with this Covid,"" Elliott said. ""We need vaccine in people's arms, preferably as close to the priority order as we can get, but this is only going to go away with vaccination and people being respectful of the public health guidelines. And until we get there, the economy is going to be a wreck and people are going to die.""

In incident command, Elliott explained how he and others give enough guidance and flexibility for teams to make their own decisions. Give them guidelines and let them ""operate inside the fences,"" he said.

""We stress that repeatedly is you're not supposed to tell people how to do your job,"" Elliott said. ""You're supposed to tell them what the objectives are, give them the resources, give them the time frame, and then stay out of their business.""

In fighting fires and Covid-19, Elliott says it's important for local leaders to do what they believe is right for their community. If something doesn't pan out right, you have to be willing to accept the consequences, he said.

""Don't wait for it to be perfect,"" Elliott said. ""You're not going to get all your answers, you're not going to get every answer to every question. It's incumbent upon leadership at the local level to take reasonable risks.""

And when it's possible, make decisions on the local level, he said. Large jurisdictions are just a ""series of smaller units,"" like hospital districts within a large county, he said.

""I think we need to trust each other a little bit, give each other a little bit of grace and recognize we're all trying to work towards the same thing,"" Elliott said. ""The more local you can let the decisions be made in that distribution process, the more success you're going to have.""

While Elliott has had success in his county, he doesn't want people to think he's got all the answers.

""I don't want to sound like we have it all figured out because we don't,"" he said. ""There's nights I'm not sleeping really well.""

How they've had 'zero doses wasted'

The county received more than 2,100 doses of the vaccine last week and it has already assigned a name of a person to each one of those valuable vials, Elliott said.

That may not sound like a lot to someone in a big city, but it's a lot in this county. Located in central Washington, Kittitas County has 48,140 residents, according to the state's Office of Financial Management.

""We're over 95% distributed for the vaccine that we have received up until this week,"" Elliott said last week. ""Because we just got a huge shipment of the vaccine, after Friday of next week, we'll be back well over 95%. When I say 95%, the vaccine is either in people's arms or people have a hard date when their appointment is because you have to space the first and second doses out.""

Kasey Knutson, a spokeswoman for the Kittitas County Public Health Department, has been letting the public know when vaccine arrives, who is eligible based on the current vaccine phase and how to get appointments. She's also in charge of getting volunteers to help with distribution.

During phase 1A of vaccine distribution, which included high-risk health care workers, high-risk first responders and residents and staff in nursing homes, the county had extra doses left over, she said.

On short notice, the emergency management center lined up 102 teachers to come in and get vaccinated, Elliott said.

The cross-functional team identified teachers, who are in vaccine phase 1B, as a group who would quickly be able to respond, Knutson said. The network for reaching teachers easily already existed through their school systems.

Some teachers may have been vaccinated earlier than anticipated, but the overall goal was to make sure that some high-priority group got the vaccine, and it didn't go to waste.

Elliott explained that sometimes there are extra doses with the Pfizer vaccine when it's mixed together, which local pharmacists are preparing in Kittitas County.

""You just don't know how many extra doses, so you have to have this flexible pool of people sort of waiting in the wings on 10 minutes notice to get the vaccine,"" Elliott said. ""We did it with teachers.""

Spacing out the vaccine doses is important for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both of which the county is using. The other part involves figuring out the logistics from traffic control and patient flow to paperwork and administering and monitoring vaccinated patients, Knutson said.

""We want to make sure that when we get people in for the first shot, that we already have a system in place, and we can guarantee that those folks are going to come back through for the second round,"" Knutson said.

One of the biggest challenges the county and many around the country face is that people want to get the vaccine as soon as possible, Knutson said. But, vaccination will be a long process.

She said she's been busy with vetting volunteers and making sure they do everything they can to avoid burning out the staff so the vaccinations can go on. This week, the goal is to distribute 215 vaccine doses a day at two clinics, she said.

""We are really aware of how eager people are to get their vaccinations and we want to just guarantee folks that we are effectively getting the vaccine out, that we're not stockpiling it and we're not going to waste the vaccine,"" she said."
The face mask that could end the pandemic,"(CNN) Getting Americans masked up is a top priority for the Biden administration.

Biden, who calls wearing masks ""a patriotic act,"" signed an executive order Wednesday -- his very first as President -- to ask Americans to wear masks of their choice for the first 100 days of the new administration. The executive order also requires mask use on all federal property, though in this case, not just any old mask will do.

On Wednesday, after the inauguration, White House press secretary Jen Psaki showed off her bright white N95 mask in the press briefing room. ""I wore it out, of course, here today and will continue to do that,"" Psaki said after removing her medical-grade mask and before turning to questions.

N95 masks are considered the gold standard in personal protective equipment because they block 95% of large and small particles utilizing a unique electrostatic filter.

The filter works by trapping neutral particles like bacteria and viruses before they pass through the mask, protecting the wearer and those around them. It's similar to how socks might get stuck to a blanket in the dryer. The N95 mask, which costs roughly $5, also fits securely to the face, eliminating most of the leakage that may occur with a loose-fitting cloth or paper mask.

A woman who won a $60 million lottery said she got the winning numbers from her husband's dream,"Want more inspiring, positive news? Sign up for The Good Stuff , a newsletter for the good in life. It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.

(CNN) Deng Pravatoudom followed her husband's dream all the way to Easy Street.

Pravatoudom, 57, has played the lottery for two decades using a set of numbers that her husband dreamed about 20 years ago. In December, his dream became reality when his wife played those numbers and won a $60 million jackpot, Ontario Lottery and Gaming (OLG) said in a news release Monday.

On December 1, the mother of two -- who was laid off during the pandemic -- went to the bank to pay some bills while her husband checked the tickets.

When they returned to the car, he told her they had won $60 million.

""I was ecstatically happy, I was crying at the same time. I couldn't believe it at first,"" Pravatoudom said during a virtual celebration where she was presented the check. ""I am going to buy a house, then if it's allowed after Covid, I'm going to travel the world.""

Call to Earth,
What Matters: Biden is planning a busy week of executive action. Here's what you need to know,"A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here

(CNN) President Joe Biden is planning a new wave of executive orders and actions this week as he looks to further dismantle many of former President Donald Trump's policies and address a slate of Democratic priorities as quickly as he can.

The planned moves, which were outlined in a draft calendar document viewed by CNN's Betsy Klein, allow Biden to set his agenda into motion while his administration continues the plodding work of coordinating with Congress on more ambitious policy goals, like a new Covid-19 relief package

The orders scheduled for this week build on the 30 executive actions Biden took in his first three days in office, which included halting funding for the construction of Trump's border wall and imposing a mask mandate on federal property. See the full list here.

While the orders and timing are subject to change, here's a rundown of the executive steps Biden is expected to take this week:

Monday, January 25

Billed as ""Buy American"" day, Biden is expected to sign one executive order directing agencies to ""strengthen requirements for procuring goods and services from sources that will support US businesses and workers.""

Tuesday, January 26

Tuesday focuses on equity, with a list of executive orders that will:

Create a policing commission and reinstate Obama-era policy on the transfer of military-style equipment to local law enforcement.

Establish steps to improve prison conditions and eliminate the use of private prisons.

Formally disavow discrimination against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, which, the document says, comes ""particularly in light of rhetoric around the Covid-19 pandemic.""

Biden also plans to sign a memorandum directing Housing and Urban Development to take steps to promote equitable housing politics.

Wednesday, January 27

The climate crisis will come into view on Wednesday with an executive order initiating regulatory actions to ""combat climate change domestically and elevates climate change as a national security priority,"" along with the re-establishment of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

Biden is also due to sign a a memorandum on scientific integrity.

Thursday, January 28

Health care is set be the the theme on Thursday with Biden set to rescind the Mexico City Policy and review the Title X ""Domestic Gag Rule."" There may also be an executive action on Medicaid, as well as the initiation of open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act.

Friday, January 29

Finally, Biden is expected to center on immigration on Friday with executive orders on regional migration and border processing, the US refugee policy and the establishment of a family reunification task force, as well as an executive order directing immediate review of the Public Charge Rule.

Impeachment trial date set

Trump's second Senate impeachment trial is scheduled to begin on February 9 after Senate leaders reached a deal to push it back, giving Trump's legal team more time to prepare and Senate Democrats a chance to consider Covid-19 legislation and to confirm Biden's Cabinet.

House Democrats will formally walk over the single article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate on Monday evening, but the agreement between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will push back the substance of the trial until February. Without an agreement, the trial would have started the afternoon after the article was transmitted to the Senate.

""We have made good progress in our efforts to determine the timing and structure of the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump,"" Schumer said Friday evening announcing the trial schedule, saying it would begin the week of February 8.

Stimulus status

As preparations for the Senate trial ramp up, Biden's team is busy attempting to build bipartisan support for their $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package -- something Biden has established as a top legislative priority in the early days of his term.

The relief package includes a $1,400 bump for stimulus checks, more aid for the unemployed, additional support for small businesses, and increased funding for vaccinations among other items

The state of play

CNN has reported that Biden's stimulus proposal already faces Republican objections . As a result, Senate Democrats have been laying the groundwork to use a rare procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the package if Republicans stall their efforts.

Pressed earlier Sunday on whether the President will hold out for bipartisanship agreement to pass the package amid growing reports of Republican unease, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the administration does want to see the proposal passed quickly, but that engaging both sides is not the ""enemy"" of speed.

""We're reaching out to people,"" Klain said. ""I don't think bipartisanship and speed are enemies of one another. The need is urgent.""

White House c al l

Biden's top economic official held a call with a group of senators Sunday afternoon to discuss the Covid-19 relief package, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN

""President Biden and his advisors will continue to engage and consult bipartisan groups of lawmakers, including today, to make the case why urgent action is needed to get relief to hard-hit communities and families and more resources to public health officials so we can ramp up vaccinations,"" one White House official told CNN.

"Three weeks into harsh lockdown, weary Brits fear it will take much longer to beat the new variant","London (CNN) People in the United Kingdom have been living under lockdown for the past three weeks, hoping their sacrifice would bring the country's latest coronavirus surge -- caused by the new, more contagious variant of the virus -- under control.

But despite the harsh restrictions, case numbers are not dropping as fast as experts have hoped. Deaths continue to rise and public health experts and government are starting to warn people that the country will be in this battle for the long run.

The new variant, known as B.1.1.7, has wreaked havoc in the UK, fueling a surge in cases towards the end of 2020 despite a national lockdown being in place. Data showing an uptick in cases in younger people suggests this was largely because schools had stayed open, enabling the variant to spread rapidly.

The UK is a cautionary tale of what could happen elsewhere. American public health experts are warning about a possible new surge in Covid-19 cases caused by the new strain first seen in southeast England. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that the new strain could become the predominant variant seen in the United States by March.

According to Public Health England, the new strain first emerged in September. By late November, scientists started to raise concerns over the rising number of infections in Kent in the southeast. The region was an anomaly, because while cases were generally going down across the country due to national restrictions, they weren't dropping in Kent.

By December, the country's leading epidemiologists were warning the new variant was outpacing the restrictions. It had by then spread to London where it was responsible for two-thirds of new cases

This forced the country into a much stricter lockdown from January 5 in which people were instructed to stay at home, households were banned from mixing -- indoors and outdoors -- and everything but essential stores closed, including most schools.

For many experts, the decision came too late. ""It's amazing that we seem to be making the same mistakes over and over again -- with increasing loss of life,"" Dr. Julian Tang, clinical virologist at the University of Leicester, noted in comments to the UK's Science Media Centre.

But is the harsher strategy working? The evidence is mixed.

Deadliest period

England reported nearly 70,000 new infections on January 4, the day before the new lockdown was announced. In terms of new cases reported, the country's worst 10 days of the entire pandemic happened between December 29 and January 11, averaging over 55,000 new cases each day.

Deaths soon followed: of the 11 deadliest days of the pandemic, 10 came between January 9 and 18. The country reported more than 1,000 deaths each day, something that has only happened once before.

A few days after the new restrictions came into effect, the number of new cases began to gradually decline -- and have continued to since.

The seven-day rolling average of new daily cases, a measure that smooths out anomalies such as lower testing at the weekends, dropped from the height of above 60,000 on January 1 to around 40,000 in recent days. However, it will likely take time for the impact to be felt in hospitals.

""We know there is a lag between reporting of new cases and any subsequent deaths,"" Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, told CNN in an email. ""For example, a few percent of newly-diagnosed today may end up in hospital in around 7-14 days from now, and then approximately 1% of today's cases will die in around 21-28 days' time,"" he added.

The number of people who are hospitalized remains at a record high, with 38,000 people in hospitals.

But while the latest figures might offer a glimpse of hope, other studies, including one by researchers at Imperial College London paints a contrasting picture.

. One study, called REACT-1 , shows that coronavirus infections remained high in early January and stayed that way for the first 10 days of lockdown, which is the period covered by the study

Unlike the official case numbers, which are based on the number of people getting tested and thus may not include those who are asymptomatic or have not yet developed symptoms, the REACT-1 study tracks current coronavirus infections in the community and this time tested more than 140,000 randomly selected people.

Steven Riley, the author of the study and a professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College, told CNN in an email that the figures do not show the kind of substantial decline that would be expected if the lockdown is strong enough to reduce the reproduction number -- the value indicates how much the virus is spreading: a reproduction rate of above 1 means the epidemic is growing. On Friday, the government said the number was between 0.8 and 1, although it cautioned this varied across the country.

The study tested samples collected between January 6 and 15 and compared them to mobility data based on the GPS locations of individuals using the Facebook mobile phone app. The data shows a decrease in mobility at the end of December, followed by increase in early January when people returned to work, which the authors say may explain the higher number of people becoming infected in early January.

Riley said that while the study did not show a big drop in infections, it wouldn't be fair to say the lockdown is entirely failing. ""Our main point is that we did not detect a sharp decline which is what we really need to see.""

The authors further noted in the paper that, ""Until prevalence in the community is reduced substantially, health services will remain under extreme pressure and the cumulative number of lives lost during this pandemic will continue to increase rapidly.""

Reacting to the numbers, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the figures show the more contagious strain was spreading ""very fast indeed.""

""I think it's too early to say when we'll be able to lift some of the restrictions,"" Johnson said.

On Friday, the government added another piece of bad news, saying there were some indications that the new strain of the virus could be more deadly

""When we look at severity and mortality, data for patients who are in hospital with the virus suggest the outcomes for those with the original variant look the same as the new variant,"" said Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser. ""However, when looking at the data for people who have tested positive, there is an indication that the rate for the new variant is higher ,"" he added.

Vallance said the early data suggests that while roughly 10 of 1,000 infected men in their 60s would die of the old variant, this could rise to roughly 13 or 14 with the new strain.

The government has also found itself under pressure to compensate people who need to self-isolate. A government-backed study published in September found that only 18% of people adhered to the self-isolation rules and suggested financial compensation might bring that number up.

Full impact will take a while

While the numbers are debated and keep changing, health experts and politicians are asking the public for patience.

The full impact of the lockdown won't be felt for a while as it will take a long time -- and a lot more staying at home -- to get the latest surge fully under control, they believe.

According to estimates by Head's team, the number of people who succumb to the disease is likely to remain high and only start falling next month. And while hospital admissions are decreasing, the number of patients who are in hospital remains at record levels. Until the number of people discharged is higher than those admitted, the hospitals will remain at risk of running out of beds.

""The daily trend is showing the lockdown having an effect on those new daily cases,"" Head said. ""However, it is important to remember that impact on hospitalizations will only really be visible from trends starting around the last week of January, and deaths should be falling across February.""

For now, this all means strict restrictions will stay in place for some time.

Top government officials have repeatedly said it is far too early to speculate about easing lockdown measures which are now scheduled to be in place until March, and possibly into the summer.

""It may well mean, for example, that any lockdown may have to be in place for longer than would have been the case with the old variant,"" Head said."
"Brexit: Rotting fish, lost business and piles of red tape hit Britain","London (CNN Business) Brexit might be done and dusted, but its specter will loom over Britain for a long time yet.

For all the fanfare made when Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck a trade deal with Brussels on Christmas Eve , the inescapable reality of leaving the European Union's customs and regulatory territory has already started to bite. The fact that the deal was only agreed one week before it came into effect meant that dangerous disruption to countless businesses that relied on seamless supply chains was inevitable.

Despite Johnson's repeated claims that Brexit is a great opportunity for British exporters and would lead to some kind of revival for free trade, the reality is very different: freshly caught fish are reportedly being left to rot as exporters cannot get them to the European Union while logistics firms are skeptical that both importing and exporting is going to be viable for many businesses in the long term. Fallout from Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic is pushing the UK economy into a sharp contraction in the first quarter, according to data published Friday by IHS Markit, meaning a double-dip recession is now on the cards.

While it should be a source of embarrassment for the PM that his deal has made life very difficult for many of the industries that he has championed post-Brexit, Johnson's public statements on the matter suggest he is oblivious to the reality that many are facing.

When asked for comment on the immediate consequences of the trade barriers implemented as a result of the deal, a UK government spokesperson told CNN Business:

""From the outset we were clear that we would be leaving the customs union and single market which meant that there would be new processes after the end of the Transition Period. These were widely communicated through our public information campaign.""

The starkest example of what Brexit is doing to British business comes from Scotland's fishing industry. Despite the government's claims during Brexit negotiations that the fishing industry was very near the top of its priority list, there is a real fear that the entire industry could collapse in a matter of weeks.

""We had an entirely new system for exporters to get their heads around that hadn't been tested prior to use. The result, somewhat inevitably, was that it started going wrong straight away,"" says James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink.

""This isn't as simple as an IT glitch that needs fixing. In a matter of days, we went from being able to send fresh food to Madrid with a single cover sheet of paperwork. Now there are roughly 26 steps for each transaction.""

A truck drives past the Houses of Parliament in a protest against post-Brexit red tape.

In the fishing industry where profit margins are often thin, every hour spent working around red tape is critical to both the freshness of the product and the productivity of the business.

The real-world impact of this means that some exporters have had the European market cut off overnight. Almost every day, pictures circulate on social media of virtually empty fish markets and boats tied up. Withers has heard stories of Scottish boats sailing 48 hours to process catches in Denmark, just to get their stock into the single market. In an industry where profit margins are often thin, every hour spent working around red tape is critical to both the freshness of the product and the productivity of the business.

When pushed on the matter, Johnson has said that he thinks these are merely teething issues and not the fault of his deal or the barriers it's created. His spokesman explains that the government is providing £23 million ($31.4 million) for the industry to ease the process.

When asked specifically about the fishing industry earlier this week, Johnson once again denied that the problems facing exporters had anything to do with his deal, but instead were due to restaurants being shut because of the pandemic.

However, Withers believes that money ""will run out quickly"" and without coming to some new sort of arrangement with the European Union, ""this sort of exporting might not be sustainable"" and will ""almost certainly lead to the very people the [Prime Minister] said he was fighting for losing their jobs.""

The scenes in Scotland might not be as dramatic as the food shortages and lines of backlogged trucks that many predicted post-Brexit, but the damage is already showing up in economic data. Brexit issues are exacerbating a slowdown caused by pandemic restrictions, IHS Markit said on Friday, and lengthening suppliers' delivery times. While 33% of manufacturers reporting a drop in exports linked the decline directly to the pandemic, some 60% linked the drop to Brexit, according to IHS.

ForagePlus, a horse nutrition business based in Wales, had dozens of parcels bound for Europe returned this week due to glitches in its shipping company's new systems for processing customs information. ""It's just a shambles basically,"" ForagePlus founder Sarah Braithwaite told CNN Business, adding that it had been nearly a month since the company was able to ship anything into Europe due to the pandemic and Brexit.

There is real concern among trucking companies and logistics firms that things are going to get much worse in the coming months.

Multiple sources within the affected sectors told CNN Business that British consumers won't feel much disruption yet, as January is a typically quiet month at ports and the United Kingdom did stockpile goods to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit. But that could change as trade volumes increase over the coming months, putting border systems under additional pressure.

This could result in a gradual reduction in the variety of fresh produce available to British shoppers. According to a spokesperson for Logistics UK, ""in the short term, while supply chains sort themselves out, it may be that we return to a more seasonal approach to shopping or have a more limited range to choose from."" This could mean that after decades of fresh fruit and vegetables at all times of the year, Brits might have to start seeing strawberries as summer treat, for example.

A supermarket customer looks at near empty shelves in a supermarket in Belfast, Northern Ireland earlier this month.

The region where food shortages could fast become a real issue is Northern Ireland, where images of empty supermarket shelves have circulated on social media. Due to the unique position of Northern Ireland, it has split with the rest of the United Kingdom and remained inside the EU single market, making it a lot harder to import food from Great Britain. Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, said that images showing empty shelves in Northern Irish supermarkets were ""clearly a Brexit issue"" and ""part of the reality"" of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.

Trade experts are concerned about the gradual decline in EU-UK trade. ""The slow decline is in some ways more dangerous than sudden food shortages,"" says David Henig, UK director at the European Centre For International Political Economy. ""I am particularly concerned about exporters being unable to fulfill orders and losing customers or just giving up completely. The long-term message that sends could be very damaging for inward investment,"" he adds.

There are legitimate questions as to why things have been so bad, despite the United Kingdom having years to prepare for the cliff edge. ""We've known about the risks of not being prepared for five years,"" says Anna Jerzewska, founder of Trade and Borders, which assists exporters and importers across Europe.

Jerzewska says that her clients are reporting numerous complaints, but most worryingly a failure of support from the UK government to resolve their issues. ""Getting an answer to a technical question could take 48 hours, which is obviously a problem for fresh produce. People in the call centers can only really point to guidance, but the guidance isn't currently fit for purpose.""

JUST WATCHED A look back at Boris Johnson's tumultuous 2020 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A look back at Boris Johnson's tumultuous 2020 03:30

And despite everyone involved working hard to resolve the early issues, Jerzewska fears this won't be enough to save struggling British exporters. ""At the moment it's shock, but the underlying costs are not going away. And for traders who work at thin profit margins, an extra couple of percentage points could be the end.""

Many of Johnson's Conservative lawmakers are struggling with how to reply to their constituents. ""The party gave us lines to read out when the deal came through presenting it as a huge success, but as time goes on, it's clear there's quite a lot of nasty surprises in Pandora's box,"" says one Conservative member of parliament who is not permitted to speak on-the-record about government policy outside of their brief.

Others say that small local businesses are up in arms at finding out that if they want to visit Europe to sell their goods, they might need a work permit from foreign governments or paperwork allowing them to move goods into the European Union.

There isn't much optimism that things will improve in the near future among moderate Conservatives. Many are extremely worried that the gradual decline caused by Brexit will ultimately lead to Europe trying to lure Britain's golden goose to the continent: The City of London, which hosts many of the world's biggest banks.

""Once the fog of Covid lifts, financial and professional services firms looking to expand globally will see London and realize that we have given up quite a lot of our competitive advantage,"" says the Conservative member of parliament.

The trade deal Johnson signed bizarrely didn't address either of these, despite them making up a huge part of the UK economy. Banks and traders in London are now hoping to be granted ""equivalence"" by the European Union, a designation that would allow them to continue serving EU clients with limited disruption.

""If no deal is reached on equivalence for financial services or data, that could kickstart a squeeze on the city from EU regulators and leave businesses wondering what the benefit of setting up in London is if you want to serve the European market,"" says Henig.

The European Union and United Kingdom are supposed to reach an agreement in March on financial services, but the mood music from both London and Brussels right now suggests that the United Kingdom is unlikely to be pulled back into the EU regulatory sphere any time soon.

Many Brexiteer lawmakers felt vindicated when the world didn't fall off its axis in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, as plenty of the anti-Brexiteers' worst nightmares failed to materialize. However, if the current trajectory of gradual decline continues, the slide could become uncontrollable.

Those politicians will have to explain to voters why they encouraged their prime minister to pursue such a hard Brexit despite the warnings of its consequences. They have a couple of months before things get really bad to put pressure on Johnson to start engaging with the reality of Brexit a little more.

The question that matters most to those struggling is how bad things must get before those who most vocally supported Brexit are willing to break ranks and admit the truth: that leaving the world's largest trading bloc has immediate consequences."
Trump adviser says former President not currently considering launching a third party,"Washington (CNN) Former President Donald Trump remains committed to reelecting Republicans and is not currently considering launching a third party, a senior Trump adviser said Sunday while noting that things could change.

Jason Miller, who had served as a senior campaign adviser to Trump, said that the former President ""has made clear his goal is to win back the House and Senate for Republicans in 2022. There's nothing that's actively being planned regarding an effort outside of that.""

But, Miller maintained, ""it's completely up to Republican senators if this is something that becomes more serious"" -- a reference to Trump's upcoming Senate impeachment trial

Multiple Trump advisers confirmed to CNN last week that he was contemplating launching a third party, but those advisers dismissed the idea as not serious. A separate adviser noted to CNN Sunday evening that Trump has talked about creating a third party for decades.

The path in the Senate to convict Trump is extremely slim

Joe Biden's authority is on the line already in first full week of presidency,"(CNN) As his first full week in the White House begins, Joe Biden already faces critical early tests of a presidency premised on political compromise and uniting Washington to fight the pandemic .

The President's team Sunday appealed for two things that may ultimately be elusive: time to stand up an aggressive attempt to finally turn around the Covid-19 nightmare and Republican buy-in for his $1.9 trillion economic relief plan.

In the week ahead, Biden is expected to unleash a new blitz of executive actions to deliver momentum to his new administration -- on Monday, for instance, removing the ban on transgender people serving in the military.

The President plans to move aggressively later in the week, taking steps to boost US workers, address racial inequality and combat climate change.

But true, lasting change and the nation's hopes of finally overcoming the pandemic will rely on Biden's ability to leverage years of experience to forge common ground in the scorched earth of the capital.

The task gets tougher by the day, partly due to the unprecedented challenge of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, which will begin in two weeks. The Republican Party is tearing itself apart in the post-Trump era, narrowing political space for GOP lawmakers who might think about helping a new Democratic President in a time of crisis. And on the Sunday talk shows, there appeared to be much less appetite for compromise among rival lawmakers than in the Oval Office.

It's a tough reality that Biden, who follows a President who often ignored the coronavirus crisis, is already parrying questions about whether his vow to deliver 100 million vaccine doses in 100 days is sufficiently ambitious.

But it's a measure of the desperation in the country, with normal life an increasingly distant memory, amid worrying new warnings about more infectious and possibly more deadly viral strains.

'The plane is in a nosedive'

Xavier Becerra, Biden's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, on Sunday addressed tension between the President's push for urgent action to fight Covid-19 and the fact it will take months for improvements to show.

""I believe President Biden is making it very clear, the plane is in a nosedive, and we have got to pull it up. And you aren't going to do that overnight. But we're going to pull it up,"" Becerra said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on a day when the US death toll of the out-of-control disaster approached 420,000

Speaking to Dana Bash, Becerra was unable to answer the question everyone wants to know: how much longer will it be until sufficient supplies of vaccines bring the days of social distancing to an end? Already, hopes of deliverance for the country by early summer look premature.

White House chief of staff Ron Klain defended Biden's 100 million target — which means only 50 million people will be fully vaccinated, given the two-dose regimen, during the period in question — as ""a very bold and ambitious goal.""

And he tried to clear up confusion of the administration's own making after the government's top infectious diseases specialist , Dr. Anthony Fauci, contradicted claims by anonymous White House sources that the new administration had to start from ""scratch"" on a vaccine distribution plan after being left nothing by Trump.

""As everyone in America has seen — the way in which people get vaccine is chaotic, it's very limited,"" Klain told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

White House appeals for Republican buy-in for rescue package

Stepping up the White House effort to swiftly pass the pandemic rescue bill, Brian Deese, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, hosted a call with as many as 16 senators Sunday afternoon. Eight Democrats and eight Republicans were invited in a core group of power players who will be crucial to Biden's ambitions of bipartisan action on many fronts.

There was strong agreement on the need to push hard on money for vaccine distribution, Jared Bernstein, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN's Pamela Brown on ""Newsroom"" Sunday.

""That doesn't mean everybody is going to agree on every detail,"" Bernstein said, before billing Biden — who served in the Senate for more than three decades — as the key cog in the process in the coming days.

""Joe Biden has a long history with working on those types of negotiations.""

The extent of the new President's task was made clear when Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, one of the GOP senators seen as open to compromise, appeared to raise questions about the speed and the size of the economic rescue bid.

""How has the first $900 billion we just passed a couple weeks ago, how has that been distributed? Most of it hasn't yet,"" Romney said on ""State of the Union.""

""It's important we don't borrow hundreds of billions, actually trillions of dollars from the Chinese for things that are not absolutely necessary. This is a time to act with prudence and care.""

GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said in a statement on Sunday evening that she, too, had reservations about the Biden plan and wanted it to be better targeted.

""It seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope,"" Collins said.

Given the urgency of the situation, Democrats are already prepping a plan to use a rare and controversial procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the package if Republicans try to block it or water it down. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told donors on a Thursday Zoom call that she was ready to pass the bill in two weeks using the tactic, a source told CNN.

The problem with using reconciliation to pass the bill with narrow Democratic majorities is that it could scupper Biden's hopes of a bipartisan plan and set back his longer-term plans for defusing the poison in Washington. But the search for support from Republicans could also force the new President to dilute his ambitions for the Covid-relief measure and make it less successful — a serious consideration at the start of a presidency that will be defined by his capacity to end the pandemic and restore the economy.

Republicans split on both Trump and Biden

The willingness of some Republicans to demonstrate good faith to Biden's overtures is also in question. Several top members of Congress have already accused him of trashing his own calls for unity in his inaugural address by taking executive orders like rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting construction of Trump's border wall.

Such objections, however, reflect a disregard for the results of the election. Biden won a clear victory in the Electoral College and amassed seven million more votes than Trump, so he can claim a mandate for his early actions.

The mood between the parties is hardly being improved by an increasingly tense spat between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, over how the 50-50 chamber will operate.

Biden's aspirations are challenged by an extraordinary confluence of political forces boiling in his first few days in office, all of which were in evidence on a clarifying weekend that predicted the year's political themes.

House Democrats will deliver the sole article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate on Monday , alleging incitement of insurrection. That will set off a ceremonial process that will culminate in the trial beginning the week of February 8. The more time that passes, the less likely it seems that there will be 17 Republican senators ready to supply the two-thirds majority needed to convict the former President and ban him from future public office.

""I think the trial is stupid. I think it's counterproductive. We already have a flaming fire in this country and it's like taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire,"" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Rubio is one of the Republicans who faces a new twist of an old dilemma about Trump. Are their political interests best served by voting to punish the former President for inciting an insurrection against Congress and an attempt to steal the election? Or is Trump's power in the party still so strong that they invite a backlash by convicting the former President?

Rubio is up for reelection in 2022 and is already having to deal with questions about whether he fears a primary challenge from the ex-President's daughter, Ivanka

Romney told CNN that he believed Trump's behavior inciting a mob was an impeachable offense. But GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the issue was ""moot"" because he believed it was unconstitutional to try a former President who was impeached -- an emerging argument among GOP lawmakers

But one of the Democratic House impeachment managers, Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, said on ""State of the Union"" that Trump must play a price for actions that have no parallel in American history.

""It's an extraordinarily heinous presidential crime. And we must move forward,"" said Dean."
"Foreign companies are giving up on the United States and betting big on China, report says","New York (CNN Business) Foreign companies are turning their backs on the United States, taking advantage of China's booming economy and superior management of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Direct investment in the US by foreign companies plummeted 49% to $134 billion last year, according to a report released Sunday by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. By contrast, foreign direct investment in China grew by 4% to $163 billion in 2020.

2020 marked the first year in history that foreign direct investment in China overtook that of the US, according to the UN. China is now the world's largest recipient of foreign companies' investments.

Although Covid-19 was a large factor in foreign direct investment tumbling in the US -- and most places around the world -- the drop-off in foreign companies' American investments began well before the pandemic

After hitting a high of $440 billion in 2015, according to the US Commerce Department, foreign investment in the US has been on a sharp downward slide. Former President Donald Trump's go-it-alone trade policies hurt foreign investment -- particularly from China, which represented the sharpest drop in US investment over the past several years. Growing economic uncertainty around the globe also contributed to the decline.

Biden signs executive order aimed at strengthening American manufacturing,"Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden signed an executive order Monday aimed at boosting American manufacturing, setting in motion a process to fulfill his campaign pledge to strengthen the federal government's Buy American rules.

Similar executive orders signed by former President Donald Trump had little effect because his administration waited to formalize changes until his second to last day in office. By contrast, Biden has set a 180-day deadline to deliver on fundamental change to the process, according to an administration official.

""I've long said that I don't accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization can keep union jobs from growing here in America,"" Biden said at a news conference before signing the order.

The order follows others Biden signed last week directing additional relief to the neediest Americans, as well as starting the process of raising the minimum wage for federal contractors and workers to $15 an hour.

The President signed 30 orders in his first three days in office , some of them reversing Trump's policies. Additional orders are expected this week with a series of themed days covering racial equity, climate, health care and immigration.

Closing loopholes in federal purchasing

The President ""believes we can rebuild the vitality of American manufacturing and our industrial strength. A big piece of that is centered around the idea that when we use taxpayer money to rebuild America, we buy American and we support American jobs,"" the administration official said Sunday on a call with reporters.

Currently, a patchwork of federal rules requires that a portion of government spending on things like infrastructure, vehicles and other equipment is restricted to goods that are made in the United States. But there are loopholes depending on the material, the amount of the purchase, and what qualifies as American made.

Biden's executive order will change how domestic content is defined and measured for qualifying products as well as increase the required threshold. It will also create a senior position at the Office of Management and Budget to oversee the process by which contractors can apply for waivers from the Buy American rules, with the goal of reducing the number of waivers granted.

The administration will also create a public website that will post all waiver requests and direct agencies to proactively connect with small American manufacturers that are often left out of the process.

What happened to Trump's promised boost

The manufacturing sector didn't get the boost Trump repeatedly promised. The number of manufacturing jobs grew during the first two years of his administration -- though at roughly the same pace as they did under President Barack Obama -- but then slowed in 2019 after the boost from the Republican-backed tax cuts wore off and as Trump's China tariffs created uncertainty for businesses.

The pandemic hit manufacturing hard as the rest of the economy slowed down. The sector is still down 543,000 jobs since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""Trump talked about buying American and hiring American a lot, but his executive orders didn't amount to much at all,"" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.

""There's an opening here for Joe Biden to really be a 'Made in America' president,"" he added.

Paul said he's eager to see Biden close the loopholes in the current federal procurement process as well as follow through on his campaign promise to purchase $400 billion in American-made goods and materials for infrastructure projects.

Biden's Buy American policy may concern some foreign trading partners. Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau said in an interview with CBS News on Sunday that ""it might jeopardize the very strong an integrated supply chains that exist between our two countries.""

Many of America's allies were hit with tariffs under the Trump administration. While Biden has also pledged to take a tough stance on trade and crack down on unfair trading practices, he has reiterated a commitment to do so in partnership with America's allies -- unlike his predecessor, who mostly acted unilaterally when it came to imposing tariffs.

""We remain very committed to working with partners and allies to modernize international trade rules to make sure that we can use our taxpayer dollars to stir investments in our own countries,"" the Biden administration official said."
Alleged Capitol rioter's brother is a Secret Service agent who once led Michelle Obama's detail,"(CNN) The brother of an alleged US Capitol rioter is a US Secret Service agent who once led former first lady Michelle Obama's detail, CNN has learned.

Preston Fairlamb III, the brother of Scott Fairlamb -- a man who faces five charges connected to his alleged role in the Capitol insurrection -- is a member of the Secret Service and, according to Obama's 2018 memoir, had ""led my detail"" at one point.

""All of us grew close to our agents over time. Preston Fairlamb led my detail then,"" Obama wrote in ""Becoming."" She attended the 2012 memorial service for the Fairlamb's father, according to a statement by the church where the memorial service was held.

Scott Fairlamb's attorney, Harley Breite, told CNN that Preston Fairlamb III was unaware of his brother's alleged actions during the attack on the Capitol. ""He was not privy to anything that my client is alleged to have done that day,"" he said.

CNN has made multiple attempts to reach Preston Fairlamb III directly. The US Secret Service and Obama's office have yet to respond to CNN's requests for comment.
